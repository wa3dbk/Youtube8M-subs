00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.700

and the other teams new group also play
those<00:01:13.840> maps<00:01:14.170> do<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.380> think<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.580> new

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
those maps do you think that the new

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.880 
those maps do you think that the new
valve<00:01:16.300> Maps<00:01:16.570> made<00:01:17.050> may<00:01:17.440> things<00:01:17.650> kind<00:01:17.830> of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
valve Maps made may things kind of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.170 
valve Maps made may things kind of
difficult<00:01:18.220> for<00:01:18.250> teams<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:21.369> know<00:01:21.430> I<00:01:21.940> kind

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
difficult for teams I don't know I kind

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.430 
difficult for teams I don't know I kind
of<00:01:22.210> like<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.479> new<00:01:22.570> valve<00:01:22.780> maps<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.140> be<00:01:23.229> honest

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
of like the new valve maps to be honest

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.030 
of like the new valve maps to be honest
and<00:01:24.930> things<00:01:25.930> like<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:26.200> pheromone<00:01:26.619> stuff<00:01:26.860> are

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
and things like in pheromone stuff are

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040 
and things like in pheromone stuff are
really<00:01:27.070> good<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.880> really<00:01:27.940> good<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.869> only

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
really good it's really good the only

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.630 
really good it's really good the only
one<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.350> don't<00:01:29.409> like<00:01:29.710> from<00:01:29.920> valve<00:01:30.159> is<00:01:30.430> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
one that I don't like from valve is the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.630 
one that I don't like from valve is the
Mirage<00:01:31.060> one<00:01:31.270> but<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:32.259> think<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.369> lot<00:01:33.520> easier

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
Mirage one but I think it's a lot easier

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.070 
Mirage one but I think it's a lot easier
when<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.060> get<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.300> tournaments<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:34.869> stuff<00:01:35.050> and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
when you get to tournaments in stuff and

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.389 
when you get to tournaments in stuff and
you<00:01:35.259> just<00:01:35.409> put<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.649> valve<00:01:35.830> maps<00:01:36.040> because

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
you just put the valve maps because

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.760 
you just put the valve maps because
every<00:01:37.180> term<00:01:37.360> I've<00:01:37.600> been<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.930> like<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.530> maps

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
every term I've been to like the maps

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.290 
every term I've been to like the maps
don't<00:01:39.070> download<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.820> sort<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.060> stuff<00:01:40.270> so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
don't download and that sort of stuff so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.180 
don't download and that sort of stuff so
you<00:01:41.020> have<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.229> end<00:01:41.380> up<00:01:41.470> down<00:01:41.619> within<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.950> SE

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
you have to end up down within the SE

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.650 
you have to end up down within the SE
versions<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.789> all<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.000> stuff<00:01:43.149> again<00:01:43.390> I

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
versions and all that stuff again I

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.240 
versions and all that stuff again I
think<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.170> definitely<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.619> way<00:01:44.710> forward<00:01:45.070> in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
think it's definitely the way forward in

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.480 
think it's definitely the way forward in
the<00:01:45.280> normal<00:01:45.910> Maps<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:46.660> yeah<00:01:47.649> some<00:01:48.190> teams<00:01:48.429> are

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the normal Maps but yeah some teams are

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.520 
the normal Maps but yeah some teams are
having<00:01:48.580> difficulty<00:01:49.179> but<00:01:49.420> most<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.320> them<00:01:50.440> were

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
having difficulty but most of them were

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.560 
having difficulty but most of them were
getting<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.770> lot<00:01:50.920> better<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.429> mean<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.450> only

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
getting a lot better I mean the only

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.490 

we<00:03:52.820> don't<00:03:53.000> see<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.270> guys<00:03:53.450> often<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:54.200> online

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
we don't see you guys often in online

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.680 
we don't see you guys often in online
competitions<00:03:55.270> is<00:03:56.270> there<00:03:56.450> any<00:03:56.570> particular

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
competitions is there any particular

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.470 
competitions is there any particular
reason<00:03:57.170> for<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.700> more<00:03:58.700> recently<00:03:59.210> it's

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
reason for that more recently it's

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.900 
reason for that more recently it's
because<00:03:59.780> we<00:04:00.740> only<00:04:00.920> like<00:04:01.520> we<00:04:01.640> have<00:04:01.730> been

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
because we only like we have been

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.180 
because we only like we have been
together<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.300> couple<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.600> months<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.260> by<00:04:04.130> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
together a couple of months but by the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.090 
together a couple of months but by the
time<00:04:04.640> all<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.390> like<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.020> for<00:04:06.170> example<00:04:06.500> DMS<00:04:06.890> we

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
time all the like so for example DMS we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.190 
time all the like so for example DMS we
miss<00:04:07.250> all<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.730> group<00:04:07.880> stage<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.360> VMs<00:04:08.840> because

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
miss all the group stage of VMs because

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.170 
miss all the group stage of VMs because
we<00:04:09.620> didn't<00:04:09.800> have<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> team<00:04:10.130> then<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.880> by<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
we didn't have a team then so by the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.550 
we didn't have a team then so by the
time<00:04:11.330> we<00:04:11.390> formed<00:04:11.810> everything<00:04:12.260> was<00:04:12.380> already

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
time we formed everything was already

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.340 
time we formed everything was already
over<00:04:13.660> obviously<00:04:14.660> we<00:04:14.780> can't<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.020> can't<00:04:15.050> get

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
over obviously we can't you can't get

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.199 
over obviously we can't you can't get
into<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:16.160> can't<00:04:16.340> get<00:04:16.459> into<00:04:16.609> anything<00:04:16.880> online

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
into you can't get into anything online

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.930 
into you can't get into anything online
if<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:17.570> don't<00:04:17.750> play<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:19.489> kind<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.820> made<00:04:19.910> a

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
if you don't play so this kind of made a

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.490 
if you don't play so this kind of made a
hard<00:04:20.209> for<00:04:20.359> us<00:04:20.450> but<00:04:20.630> hopefully<00:04:20.989> if<00:04:21.170> we<00:04:21.260> come<00:04:21.410> to

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
hard for us but hopefully if we come to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.160 
hard for us but hopefully if we come to
come<00:04:22.040> here<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.370> do<00:04:22.460> well<00:04:22.670> then<00:04:23.300> we<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.930> start

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
come here and do well then we can start

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.170 
come here and do well then we can start
getting<00:04:24.260> into<00:04:24.560> ESEA<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.460> fighting<00:04:25.850> software

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
getting into ESEA and fighting software

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.910 
getting into ESEA and fighting software
playing<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.420> intermediate<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.110> think<00:04:27.800> we're

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
playing the intermediate I think we're

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.950 
playing the intermediate I think we're
top<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.340> just<00:04:28.550> know<00:04:28.670> so<00:04:29.030> we'll<00:04:29.660> just<00:04:29.810> keep

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
top of that just know so we'll just keep

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.270 
top of that just know so we'll just keep
putting<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.470> we'll<00:04:30.560> play<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.770> next<00:04:30.890> EMS

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
putting that and we'll play the next EMS

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.920 
putting that and we'll play the next EMS
when<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.520> comes<00:04:31.700> up<00:04:31.850> but<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.540> just<00:04:32.720> purely

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
when it comes up but it's just purely

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.330 
when it comes up but it's just purely
because<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.410> just<00:04:33.500> bad<00:04:33.680> timing<00:04:33.860> that's<00:04:34.250> all

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
because it's just bad timing that's all

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.170 
because it's just bad timing that's all
the<00:04:34.460> reason<00:04:34.700> we<00:04:35.000> went<00:04:35.240> online<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:36.050> much

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
the reason we went online that much

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.420 
the reason we went online that much
and<00:04:37.509> obviously<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.440> year<00:04:38.680> all<00:04:38.949> roads<00:04:39.220> lead

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
and obviously this year all roads lead

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.129 
and obviously this year all roads lead
to<00:04:39.460> Dreamhack<00:04:40.000> winter<00:04:40.060> what<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.810> what<00:04:41.050> are

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
to Dreamhack winter what it what are

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.159 
to Dreamhack winter what it what are
your<00:04:41.259> plans<00:04:41.410> for<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:42.570> we'd<00:04:43.570> love<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.750> go

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
your plans for that we'd love to go

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.140 
your plans for that we'd love to go
bring<00:04:44.620> qualify<00:04:45.070> or<00:04:45.220> gain<00:04:45.400> by<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.639> however<00:04:46.090> it

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
bring qualify or gain by it however it

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.310 
bring qualify or gain by it however it
works<00:04:47.220> by<00:04:48.220> it's<00:04:48.340> only<00:04:48.490> 16<00:04:48.880> teams<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.509> don't<00:04:50.259> know

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
works by it's only 16 teams I don't know

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.159 
works by it's only 16 teams I don't know
if<00:04:50.380> we'd<00:04:50.500> go<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.979> BYOC<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.960> don't<00:04:52.960> think<00:04:53.110> we

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
if we'd go to the BYOC I don't think we

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.510 
if we'd go to the BYOC I don't think we
go<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.320> that<00:04:53.500> size<00:04:53.680> whether<00:04:53.919> we<00:04:54.070> do<00:04:54.190> win<00:04:54.370> these

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
go to that size whether we do win these

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.890 
go to that size whether we do win these
on<00:04:54.639> online<00:04:54.880> qualifiers<00:04:55.120> which<00:04:55.600> have<00:04:55.750> been
