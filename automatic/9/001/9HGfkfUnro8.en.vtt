00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409

maybe<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.310> biggest<00:01:20.060> drawback<00:01:20.509> for<00:01:20.689> me<00:01:20.749> is

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
maybe the biggest drawback for me is

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.770 
maybe the biggest drawback for me is
play<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.520> see<00:01:22.729> there<00:01:22.909> it's<00:01:23.299> got<00:01:23.450> some<00:01:23.600> blade
