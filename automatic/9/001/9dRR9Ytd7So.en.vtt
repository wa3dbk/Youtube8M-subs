hi then hear from Carmen Auto comm show

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.930 
hi then hear from Carmen Auto comm show
you<00:00:05.509> how<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.569> process<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.350> clearing<00:00:07.940> crash

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
you how the process of clearing crash

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.320 
you how the process of clearing crash
data<00:00:10.280> from<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:12.799> GM<00:00:13.830> airbag<00:00:14.460> control<00:00:14.820> module

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
data from the GM airbag control module

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.060 
data from the GM airbag control module
this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.500> ones<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.920> are<00:00:17.039> sealed<00:00:19.070> these

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
this is the ones that are sealed these

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
this is the ones that are sealed these
are<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.550> options<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.420> sealed

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
are the other options that are sealed

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.230 
are the other options that are sealed
these<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.680> actually<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.460> make<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
these will actually have to make a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.220 
these will actually have to make a
little<00:00:24.539> incision<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:26.480> get<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> board<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
little incision and get to the board and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.679 
little incision and get to the board and
then<00:00:28.439> weld<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.910> drawn<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
then weld on to it's all drawn to it and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.860 
then weld on to it's all drawn to it and
then<00:00:31.289> program<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:32.329> these<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.719> can

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
then program these these you can

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.490 
then program these these you can
actually<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.700> without<00:00:35.700> doing<00:00:35.969> anything<00:00:36.500> we've

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
actually do without doing anything we've

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.020 
actually do without doing anything we've
got<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> special<00:00:38.160> connector<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.850> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
got a special connector we just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
got a special connector we just
connected<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:39.719> goes<00:00:40.110> through<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
connected and then goes through the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940 
connected and then goes through the
programmer<00:00:41.210> which<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.390> pretty<00:00:42.629> spendy<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.350> good

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
programmer which is pretty spendy a good

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.520 
programmer which is pretty spendy a good
programmer<00:00:44.870> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.050> don't<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> good

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
programmer if you don't have a good

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
programmer if you don't have a good
program<00:00:46.770> you'll<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> open<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
program you'll have to open it up and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.830 
program you'll have to open it up and
yeah<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.590> big<00:00:50.329> job<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.629> those

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
yeah it's a pretty big job to do those

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.250 
yeah it's a pretty big job to do those
and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> programmer<00:00:54.989> all

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and then if you do have a programmer all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.560 
and then if you do have a programmer all
you<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:57.440> do<00:00:58.440> is<00:01:00.230> read<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> file

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
you have to do is read the file

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
you have to do is read the file
this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> called<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> dump<00:01:05.090> once<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> read

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this is called also a dump once you read

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.210 
this is called also a dump once you read
the<00:01:06.420> dump<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.280> also<00:01:08.520> need<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.450> some

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
the dump you will also need to have some

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.969 
the dump you will also need to have some
basic<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.670> least<00:01:11.850> professional<00:01:12.740> skills<00:01:13.740> on

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
basic or at least professional skills on

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.390 
basic or at least professional skills on
programming<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> hex<00:01:14.939> Dex<00:01:16.009> you'll<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
programming the hex Dex you'll have to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
programming the hex Dex you'll have to
have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.750> good<00:01:18.750> air<00:01:18.869> back<00:01:19.049> dump<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
have a good air back dump for that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
have a good air back dump for that
particular<00:01:20.430> part<00:01:20.670> number<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> bad<00:01:21.360> dump<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
particular part number and a bad dump so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
particular part number and a bad dump so
that<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.369> where<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.270> crash

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that way you would know where the crash

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.109 
that way you would know where the crash
data<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.110> stored<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:26.759> you'll<00:01:26.880> read

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
data is stored because when you'll read

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
data is stored because when you'll read
it<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:28.080> you'll<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.740> bunch<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.130> numbers

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it all you'll see is a bunch of numbers

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.319 
it all you'll see is a bunch of numbers
and<00:01:31.280> if<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.060> you're

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and if you don't know what you're

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
and if you don't know what you're
reading<00:01:33.740> you're<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.159> able<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
reading you're not going to be able to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.800 
reading you're not going to be able to
program<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> bunch<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> numbers

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
program these are a bunch of numbers

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.109 
program these are a bunch of numbers
that<00:01:37.110> you're<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:38.000> you're<00:01:39.000> gonna

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that you're going to have you're gonna

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.410 
that you're going to have you're gonna
get<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.680> order<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.299> clear<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
get so in order for you to clear the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.789 
get so in order for you to clear the
crash<00:01:42.630> data<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:45.799> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
crash data you would have to know the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.760 
crash data you would have to know the
programming<00:01:47.280> skills<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> since<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
programming skills so since I do this

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
programming skills so since I do this
all<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.060> clear<00:01:51.720> over

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
all the time all I do is just clear over

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
all the time all I do is just clear over
here<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:54.590> then

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.469 

press<00:02:01.450> right<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.610> what<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.030> did<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.450> just

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
press right so what I did is just

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.820 
press right so what I did is just
cleaned<00:02:05.439> up<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.799> original<00:02:06.719> program

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
cleaned up the original program

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.290 
cleaned up the original program
everything<00:02:08.830> stays<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.280> same<00:02:09.459> if<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.479> have<00:02:10.869> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
everything stays the same if you have a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.420 
everything stays the same if you have a
bin<00:02:13.300> or<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.569> seat<00:02:13.870> program<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> everything

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
bin or a seat program to it everything

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.910 
bin or a seat program to it everything
stays<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.700> same<00:02:15.849> all<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:17.019> did<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.560> clean

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
stays the same all we did is just clean

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.210 
stays the same all we did is just clean
the<00:02:18.069> crash<00:02:18.370> data<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.380> now<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.440> computer<00:02:20.769> is

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the crash data and now the computer is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.330 
the crash data and now the computer is
as<00:02:21.730> good<00:02:22.120> as<00:02:22.390> new

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
as good as new

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.170 
as good as new
without<00:02:24.630> making<00:02:25.630> any<00:02:26.250> holes<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.549> here<00:02:27.849> so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
without making any holes in here so

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.900 
without making any holes in here so
that's<00:02:28.930> how<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.230> clear<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.099> crash<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.700> up

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910
