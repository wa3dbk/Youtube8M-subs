see<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> comes<00:00:52.590> packed<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.309> anti-static

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
see it comes packed in some anti-static

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
see it comes packed in some anti-static
foam<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> video<00:00:54.960> wants<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> cards<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.010> send

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
foam and video wants the cards they send

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
foam and video wants the cards they send
to<00:00:56.370> reviewers<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.120> arrive<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.710> piece<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to reviewers to arrive in one piece it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
to reviewers to arrive in one piece it
also<00:00:59.399> comes<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.030> anti-static<00:01:00.539> bubble<00:01:01.410> wrap

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
also comes in an anti-static bubble wrap

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.660 
also comes in an anti-static bubble wrap
which<00:01:01.859> we're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.370> ahead<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> open

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
which we're going to go ahead and open

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.560 
which we're going to go ahead and open
up<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.960> inside<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.570> anti-static

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
up which is then inside an anti-static

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
up which is then inside an anti-static
bag<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> yes<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.630> arrived<00:01:09.990> safely<00:01:10.560> looking

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
bag so yes it arrived safely looking

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250 
bag so yes it arrived safely looking
good<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> hopefully<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.750> throw<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.080> on

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
good and hopefully when we throw this on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
good and hopefully when we throw this on
the<00:01:13.350> test<00:01:13.560> bench<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:14.100> review<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.640> going

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the test bench for our review it's going

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
the test bench for our review it's going
to<00:01:14.850> function<00:01:15.150> great<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.080> sure<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to function great and I'm sure well so

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
to function great and I'm sure well so
the<00:01:17.159> first<00:01:17.189> thing<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.119> card<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the first thing we see about the card is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
the first thing we see about the card is
that<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.560> videos<00:01:19.890> sort<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.490> signature

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that it has in videos sort of signature

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
that it has in videos sort of signature
Kepler<00:01:21.780> shroud<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.500> looks<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.369> sharp

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
Kepler shroud it looks really sharp

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
Kepler shroud it looks really sharp
looks<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.330> good<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.200> actually<00:01:25.380> not

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
looks really good but is actually not

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
looks really good but is actually not
that<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.000> mean<00:01:27.390> compared<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.049> like

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that I mean compared to something like

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.030 
that I mean compared to something like
the<00:01:28.350> 690<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.030> Titan<00:01:30.600> cooler<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.799> as

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the 690 or the Titan cooler it is not as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
the 690 or the Titan cooler it is not as
expensive<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.360> where

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
expensive to make so you can see where

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.910 
expensive to make so you can see where
there<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:33.960> been<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> polycarbonate

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
there would have been a polycarbonate

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
there would have been a polycarbonate
window<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> fins<00:01:36.450> underneath<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
window to see the fins underneath and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.999 
window to see the fins underneath and
where<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.350> would<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.500> been<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.680> glowing

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
where there would have been a glowing

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.560 
where there would have been a glowing
logo<00:01:38.340> they've<00:01:38.759> replaced<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
logo they've replaced that with a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140 
logo they've replaced that with a
plastic<00:01:40.189> textured<00:01:41.189> pattern<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
plastic textured pattern and then a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
plastic textured pattern and then a
green<00:01:42.390> GeForce<00:01:42.810> GTX<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> top<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> still

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
green GeForce GTX on the top it still

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
green GeForce GTX on the top it still
looks<00:01:44.100> sharp<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.610> obviously<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.509> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
looks sharp but obviously this is this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
looks sharp but obviously this is this
is<00:01:46.170> slightly<00:01:46.380> less<00:01:46.649> expensive<00:01:46.920> they've<00:01:47.610> got

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is slightly less expensive they've got

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.359 
is slightly less expensive they've got
their<00:01:48.149> exhaust<00:01:48.659> fan<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.740> blower<00:01:50.009> style

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
their exhaust fan so it's a blower style

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.550 
their exhaust fan so it's a blower style
fan<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> back<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.570> doesn't<00:01:52.170> keep<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
fan on the back this doesn't keep the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
fan on the back this doesn't keep the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

from board partners but what it does do
is<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.920> takes<00:01:59.549> all<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.790> air<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.090> inside<00:02:00.719> your

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
is it takes all the air from inside your

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.740 
is it takes all the air from inside your
case<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> pushes<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> out<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.909> back<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.570> this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
case and pushes it out the back so this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
case and pushes it out the back so this
is<00:02:03.869> great<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.200> small<00:02:04.590> form-factor<00:02:04.920> systems

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
is great for small form-factor systems

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
is great for small form-factor systems
or<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.000> systems<00:02:06.390> where<00:02:06.659> optimal<00:02:07.469> ventilation

don't<00:02:10.170> want<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> add<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> bunch<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.950> fans<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.610> for

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
don't want to add a bunch of fans so for

don't want to add a bunch of fans so for
quiet<00:02:12.090> computing<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.260> often<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.770> bed

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
quiet computing this is often a bed

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.910

design<00:02:14.400> its<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.970> PCI<00:02:15.330> Express<00:02:15.690> 3.0<00:02:16.409> card<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
design its a PCI Express 3.0 card so

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.110 
design its a PCI Express 3.0 card so
here<00:02:17.099> on<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> bottom<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> card<00:02:17.909> you<00:02:17.940> see

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
here on the bottom of the card you see

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.420 
here on the bottom of the card you see
it's<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.299> 16<00:02:18.690> X<00:02:18.900> card<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.069> much<00:02:20.159> par

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
it's a 16 X card this is pretty much par

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.960 
it's a 16 X card this is pretty much par
for<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.670> course<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.500> unlike<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.799> 650<00:02:23.370> Ti<00:02:23.580> it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
for the course and unlike the 650 Ti it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.149 
for the course and unlike the 650 Ti it
does<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.659> support<00:02:25.049> for<00:02:25.200> SLI<00:02:25.680> which<00:02:25.860> makes

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
does have support for SLI which makes

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.949 
does have support for SLI which makes
sense<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.519> I've<00:02:27.090> said<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.599> lot<00:02:27.810> of

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
sense because I've said this a lot of

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.890 
sense because I've said this a lot of
times<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:29.010> low-end<00:02:29.489> cards<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.180> usually

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
times but for low-end cards it usually

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
times but for low-end cards it usually
makes<00:02:31.049> more<00:02:31.319> sense<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.739> buy<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> single<00:02:32.459> better

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
makes more sense to buy a single better

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.930 
makes more sense to buy a single better
card<00:02:33.330> versus<00:02:34.049> buying<00:02:34.260> two<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.739> them<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.370> NVIDIA

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
card versus buying two of them so NVIDIA

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.729 
card versus buying two of them so NVIDIA
has<00:02:35.970> gone<00:02:36.330> ahead<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.900> they<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.110> segmented

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
has gone ahead and they have segmented

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.809 
has gone ahead and they have segmented
their<00:02:37.920> graphics<00:02:38.280> card<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.580> they've<00:02:38.700> gone

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
their graphics card and they've gone

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.729 
their graphics card and they've gone
okay<00:02:39.090> look<00:02:39.330> we're<00:02:39.690> only<00:02:39.750> going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.019> put<00:02:40.170> SLI<00:02:40.620> on

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
okay look we're only going to put SLI on

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.559 
okay look we're only going to put SLI on
the<00:02:40.860> cards<00:02:41.190> where<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.730> may<00:02:41.910> actually<00:02:42.150> make

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
the cards where it may actually make

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.690 
the cards where it may actually make
sense<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.349> buy<00:02:43.470> two<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:43.920> cards<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.459> run

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
sense to buy two of these cards and run

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.490 
sense to buy two of these cards and run
them<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:44.909> SLI<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.780> other<00:02:45.930> thing<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> makes

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
them in SLI the other thing that makes

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
them in SLI the other thing that makes
this<00:02:46.709> card<00:02:46.980> make<00:02:47.190> more<00:02:47.400> sense<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.700> run<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.030> SLI

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
this card make more sense to run in SLI

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
this card make more sense to run in SLI
is<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.989> fact<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.530> has<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:50.720> 192<00:02:51.720> bit<00:02:51.930> bus<00:02:52.200> at

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
is the fact that it has a 192 bit bus at

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.559 
is the fact that it has a 192 bit bus at
least<00:02:52.620> that's<00:02:53.129> what<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:53.489> notes<00:02:53.730> say<00:02:53.970> anyway<00:02:54.329> we

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
least that's what my notes say anyway we

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.839 
least that's what my notes say anyway we
can<00:02:54.720> yeah<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.079> we<00:02:55.170> go<00:02:55.319> 192<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.340> bus<00:02:56.549> with

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
can yeah there we go 192 bit bus with

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.119 
can yeah there we go 192 bit bus with
two<00:02:56.879> gigs<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.660> memory<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.440> if<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> were<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.920> run

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
two gigs of memory so if you were to run

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.509 
two gigs of memory so if you were to run
to<00:02:59.519> one<00:03:00.239> gig<00:03:00.540> cards<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.019> SLI<00:03:01.530> number<00:03:02.190> one<00:03:02.370> is

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
to one gig cards in SLI number one is

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.800 
to one gig cards in SLI number one is
you<00:03:02.609> might<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:02.910> some<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.150> performance<00:03:03.690> of

you might get some more performance of

you might get some more performance of
the<00:03:03.930> GPU<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.950> you're<00:03:05.099> not<00:03:05.250> actually<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.760> to

the GPU but you're not actually going to

remember two cards running an SLI each

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.500 
remember two cards running an SLI each
with<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.099> Giga<00:03:11.340> memory<00:03:11.700> gives<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> total<00:03:12.480> of

card two gigs of memory makes it

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.080 
card two gigs of memory makes it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.210 
suitable for modern games at 1080p I'd
say<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:21.870> gig<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.380> quite<00:03:22.650> enough<00:03:22.919> in<00:03:23.130> this

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
say one gig is not quite enough in this

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.789 
say one gig is not quite enough in this
contrasts<00:03:24.060> with<00:03:24.090> AMD's<00:03:24.930> recent<00:03:25.440> launch<00:03:25.620> of

the 77 90 having only one gig of memory

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.680 
the 77 90 having only one gig of memory
I'd<00:03:28.980> say<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.910> price<00:03:30.209> class<00:03:30.450> although

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
I'd say in this price class although

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.360 
I'd say in this price class although
this<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.109> a<00:03:31.139> little<00:03:31.380> bit<00:03:31.560> higher<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.010> got

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
excited to see on this card is the fact

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.650 
excited to see on this card is the fact
that<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:16.979> has<00:04:17.160> four<00:04:17.549> outputs<00:04:18.000> natively<00:04:18.419> on

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
that it has four outputs natively on

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080 
that it has four outputs natively on
some<00:04:19.139> of<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.440> lower<00:04:20.160> end<00:04:20.400> Kepler<00:04:20.789> cards

before we were seeing only three outputs

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.430 
before we were seeing only three outputs
which<00:04:23.370> means<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.789> can't<00:04:24.120> support<00:04:24.750> three

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
which means you can't support three

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.050

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
older cheaper card although I believe

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.690 
older cheaper card although I believe
that<00:05:07.530> card<00:05:07.740> stays<00:05:07.979> current<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.490> can't

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
that card stays current so I can't

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.890 
that card stays current so I can't
necessarily<00:05:08.729> call<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.330> older<00:05:09.600> but<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
necessarily call it older but the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.890 
necessarily call it older but the
previously<00:05:10.470> released<00:05:10.710> card<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.220> also<00:05:11.900> boosts

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
previously released card it also boosts

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.570

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
clock of ten thirty three so this is at

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.820 
clock of ten thirty three so this is at

running in boost mode versus that older
card<00:05:22.680> that's<00:05:23.430> really<00:05:23.789> cool

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
card that's really cool

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.170 
card that's really cool
Plus<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:24.990> 192<00:05:25.620> bit<00:05:25.830> bus<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.850> extra

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
Plus that 192 bit bus and the extra

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.110 
Plus that 192 bit bus and the extra
memory<00:05:27.360> gives<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.199> ton<00:05:28.860> more<00:05:29.460> performance

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
memory gives you a ton more performance

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.820

and<00:05:30.360> we're<00:05:30.720> really<00:05:30.990> really<00:05:31.199> excited<00:05:31.289> to<00:05:31.680> check

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
and we're really really excited to check

and we're really really excited to check
it<00:05:31.950> out<00:05:32.010> it<00:05:32.160> also<00:05:32.280> has<00:05:32.490> six<00:05:32.820> gigahertz<00:05:33.500> gddr5

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500

it out it also has six gigahertz gddr5
memory<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.639> think<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.060> pretty<00:05:36.270> much

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
memory and I think that pretty much

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.140 
memory and I think that pretty much
wraps<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.870> up<00:05:36.990> 768<00:05:37.800> cuda<00:05:38.100> cores<00:05:38.130> just<00:05:38.880> like<00:05:39.030> the
