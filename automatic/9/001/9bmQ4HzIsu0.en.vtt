00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 and well we are all at a desk 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.650
 episode 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.769
 4 it seems to me this time we're going to start 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.030
 let's make food whether or not this 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.600
 video you've been waiting for a lot 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.790
 OK 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.180
 because I'm not telling you, okay, let's go 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.250
 to start good we will give texture as 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.070
 we know we create a new texture to the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.840
 that we want and for example I'm going to do 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 that you can buy an emerald 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 because if 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.719
 and red the red bear does not 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.789
 green 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.540
 butt write down a careful undertakes 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.199
 in the nose it is yellow it must yellow we go 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.199
 to news 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.050
 use what texture is what type are we going 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.220
 we go to block or item this case is a 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.640
 item because food is an item so 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.250
 we are going to 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.790
 it's look 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 nothing 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 food we put the name to the item 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.880
 valley we accept 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.590
 we have to wait a bit for 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.520
 we can change how you see we are going to succeed 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 and we give new moore 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.090
 we go to food and we put the name of the mod 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 let's call him 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.530
 emerald emeralds 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.530
 a junior 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.830
 food let's go 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.830
 how would it be I do not care let's go ok 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.140
 let's add the texture we want 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.040
 Now I will like 20 million 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.040
 years to find 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.750
 we are not going to next 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.240
 and well I will explain you name and good 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.090
 this is the name where when 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.980
 we take the emerald this item we're going 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.290
 the name that he says is worth it, here we go 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.370
 to put 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.909
 sme sme 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.909
 gives 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.860
 they have one 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.670
 how is it called I like a side 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.670
 in Spanish 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.760
 loudon stacks ice that is the number 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.100
 maximum of this list that is by 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.310
 defect 64 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.590
 and good here is nutrition or the valium 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 is the amount of little thighs that you 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.620
 recover four continue four thighs 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.599
 they seem to me now let's see the top 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.230
 because he does not say that, not wise, I just 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:11.270
 find out that you can do more than 20 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.160
 Well, everyone seems to me 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.610
 each 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.600
 real cotino each one is medium 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.940
 Thigh it seems to me two would be a thigh 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.640
 it would be a thigh and a half four would be two 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.120
 a thousand and all let's put what I'm going to put 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.540
 one and a half the two go a little more than 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.310
 bread 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.190
 or our bread from taiwan 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.160
 it's dog food, let's put it on 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.290
 because not like yellow emerald has 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.930
 a potion effect if we want it 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.870
 have a potion position effect what 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.290
 we point and take the effect I'm going to 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.290
 put for example 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.400
 speed 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.470
 move speed I think it's speed 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.470
 but also sweetness I'm not sure 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.330
 camps because no time d 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.470
 of effect of the potion let's put it 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.820
 be in seconds it seems 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.820
 for more than 60 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.450
 okay it's a time where I think this 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.450
 it's a minute 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.490
 I do not know, let's put it 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.500
 6 7 and 10 seconds I think they are for 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.030
 we put it like that and it's already 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.420
 in amount of good infection 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.210
 infection has a month now now it's 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.310
 the probability that you can get 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.520
 come out this effect is worth then let's 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.830
 put it 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.920
 fifty% 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.030
 ok we have the 50 percent that 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.980
 you can another that we were not going to álex good 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.690
 the events as always I tell you not the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.210
 I'm going to play because they 're going to change me 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.050
 things and I do not want to explain it in the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.190
 human worth 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.830
 call later 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.510
 I'll explain it, it 's very easy 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.340
 You want to prove yourselves I do not know what 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.600
 I recommend because after that man 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.390
 the game grows and the motive of the side 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.460
 good we give example to wine food tweety 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.180
 food is it when we have eaten the 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.300
 food 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.289
 you have to select is an event that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.490
 expose titín iii españa and that violated 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.610
 when I eat it and that's it 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.550
 we give next we do not touch anything 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:52.400
 one that is portfolio and the food I'm going to 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.400
 is that when I do I know 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.610
 one 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.900
 since I debuted a lot of our 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.169
 balloons is annoying this but in the bucket 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.969
 uncle 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.969
 I do not understand the time 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.639
 what would it be if it is total 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.520
 that you can eat an emerald 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:32.610
 globus vale is a creative mode so 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.100
 we do it like this we 'll go for example is 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.600
 the amount of when we grow this the 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.080
 number of items that will give us 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.810
 then for example points is worth I go 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.400
 to leave it in 1 go to next and it would be 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.990
 finished this would be the next 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.320
 tutorial for the next one we're going to 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.940
 phoenix what we will do is make a 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.650
 armor is very simple 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:01.740
 tutorial then it will take two minutes in 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.130
 explain it is very easy things that I'm going 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.660
 to say right now since this video what 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.160
 you are going to see most people like 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.820
 70 people 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.340
 good videos tutorials me 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.890
 it's going to be harder for me to make videos 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.660
 in itself because as they have started 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:24.080
 classes we have a week or so 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.810
 and it's going to be more crappy because with the 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.000
 exams and this thing that makes me more 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.849
 difficult but once in a while as 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.669
 you have seen receiving video 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:37.809
 and that would be all thanks for watching the 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.809
 video and goodbye
