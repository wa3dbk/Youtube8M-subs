what<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.469> piece<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> 3-inch

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
what we have here is a piece of 3-inch

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.270 
what we have here is a piece of 3-inch
clear<00:00:11.969> PVC<00:00:12.179> pipe<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.769> has<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
clear PVC pipe and what it has in it is

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.010 
clear PVC pipe and what it has in it is
basically<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.790> household<00:00:15.210> cooking<00:00:15.420> grease<00:00:15.809> it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
basically a household cooking grease it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.540 
basically a household cooking grease it
has<00:00:16.139> Crisco<00:00:16.529> grease<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.190> some<00:00:17.340> dirt

has Crisco grease in it and some dirt
and<00:00:18.170> we<00:00:19.170> want<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> demonstrate<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and we want to demonstrate the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.000 
and we want to demonstrate the
difference<00:00:20.220> between<00:00:20.279> cabling<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.300> jetting

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
difference between cabling and jetting

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.259 
difference between cabling and jetting
so<00:00:23.010> we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.910> video<00:00:24.090> started

out with a three inch blade and a
regular<00:00:30.960> cable<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.300> we're<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.450> insert

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
regular cable and we're going to insert

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.130 
regular cable and we're going to insert
this<00:00:34.880> dissimilar<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.149> snake<00:00:36.450> into<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> pipe

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this dissimilar to snake into the pipe

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.979 
this dissimilar to snake into the pipe
and<00:00:37.440> we're<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> demonstrate<00:00:39.390> what

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and we're going to demonstrate what

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.420 
and we're going to demonstrate what
happens<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.680> using<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> cable<00:00:41.190> on

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
happens when you're using a cable on

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630 
happens when you're using a cable on
this<00:00:41.550> type<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.840> situation<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:44.250> lack<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this type of situation and the lack of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
this type of situation and the lack of
effectiveness<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.480> would<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.840> by<00:00:46.289> using

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
effectiveness you would get by using

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
effectiveness you would get by using
this<00:00:47.100> type<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.370> equipment<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> type<00:00:48.510> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this type of equipment for this type of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.150 
this type of equipment for this type of
job<00:00:49.940> as<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.680> cable<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.770> turning

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
through the grease turn into the dirt

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.790 
through the grease turn into the dirt
that's<00:00:55.260> inside<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> pipe<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:57.199> it's<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that's inside the pipe and it's going to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
that's inside the pipe and it's going to
make<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> hole<00:00:59.219> through<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.520> as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
make a hole through it as you can see it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.600 
make a hole through it as you can see it
going<00:01:01.500> through<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> pipe<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:04.610> we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
going through the pipe right now we're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.740 
going through the pipe right now we're
going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.880> further<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> further<00:01:06.330> through

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
going to go further and further through

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.560 
going to go further and further through
it<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.439> cutter<00:01:08.040> blade<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:09.360> see

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it with it with cutter blade you see

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.179 
it with it with cutter blade you see
it's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.200> whole<00:01:10.380> width<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> pipe<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.040> can

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's a whole width of the pipe you can

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's a whole width of the pipe you can
see<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.549> great<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> sides<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
see it's great from the sides of the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230 
see it's great from the sides of the
pipe<00:01:13.010> as<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> push<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.970> made<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
pipe as we push that way we made that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.490 
pipe as we push that way we made that
way<00:01:15.360> through<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> dirt<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.140> we're<00:01:16.320> going

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
way through the dirt now we're going

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.640 
way through the dirt now we're going
into<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> grease<00:01:17.159> portion<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.650> we're

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
into the grease portion of it and we're

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
into the grease portion of it and we're
going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.130> salt<00:01:20.280> away<00:01:20.400> through<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
going to put your salt away through this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
going to put your salt away through this
pipe<00:01:21.259> until<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.860> side<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
pipe until we get to the other side and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760 
pipe until we get to the other side and
and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.049> done<00:01:25.259> doing<00:01:25.650> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and then when we get done doing this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
and then when we get done doing this
we'll<00:01:25.979> pull<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> cable<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.810> we're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
we'll pull the cable back out and we're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
we'll pull the cable back out and we're
going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> demonstrate<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:30.299> some

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
going to demonstrate how we put some

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.569 
going to demonstrate how we put some
water<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.380> end<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.400> you'll

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
water in the other end that you'll

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.850 
water in the other end that you'll
actually<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:33.060> flow<00:01:33.329> through<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> pipe<00:01:33.930> but

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
actually get flow through the pipe but

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
actually get flow through the pipe but
you're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:37.020> though

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you're going to see when we even though

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
you're going to see when we even though
when<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.799> flow<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.759> pipe<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> not

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
when you do get flow that pipe is not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300

now<00:02:27.140> you're<00:02:27.260> going<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.410> we're<00:02:27.709> going<00:02:27.830> to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
now you're going to we're going to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.980 
now you're going to we're going to
demonstrate<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.610> we<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.390> cabled<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
demonstrate as we just cabled it the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.020 
demonstrate as we just cabled it the
line<00:02:30.200> was<00:02:30.380> completely<00:02:31.160> stopped<00:02:31.400> up<00:02:31.610> before

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
line was completely stopped up before

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.330 
line was completely stopped up before
and<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:33.650> we're<00:02:33.800> doing<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.130> we're<00:02:34.310> putting

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and what we're doing is we're putting

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.910 
and what we're doing is we're putting
water<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.240> we<00:02:36.020> get<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> good<00:02:36.380> flow<00:02:36.650> as

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
water in it and we get a good flow as

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.460 
water in it and we get a good flow as
you<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.280> sign<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:38.360> appears<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.290> line

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
you can sign so it appears that the line

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.870 
you can sign so it appears that the line
is<00:02:39.650> open<00:02:40.240> but<00:02:41.240> as<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.959> take<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> look<00:02:42.560> inside

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
is open but as you take a look inside

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.840 
is open but as you take a look inside
you're<00:02:43.880> going<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> see<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.860> pipe<00:02:46.130> you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you're going to see that the pipe you

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.310 
you're going to see that the pipe you
can<00:02:47.000> see<00:02:47.180> some<00:02:47.360> light<00:02:47.540> through<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.810> but

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
can see some light through it but

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.340 
can see some light through it but
obviously<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.459> pipes<00:02:49.700> not<00:02:49.880> open<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.230> our

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
obviously the pipes not open this is our

the market use 16 gallons a minute which
is<00:02:59.060> very<00:02:59.570> important<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.320> when<00:03:00.470> jetting

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
is very important and when jetting

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.039 
and there's a couple nozzles cleaning
the<00:03:56.980> side<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.370> pipe<00:03:57.489> as<00:03:57.700> if<00:03:57.819> rotating<00:03:58.450> the

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
the side of the pipe as if rotating the

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.750 
the side of the pipe as if rotating the
pressure<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.440> way<00:03:59.590> down<00:03:59.830> so<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.190> nozzle<00:04:00.700> is

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
pressure is way down so the nozzle is

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.580 
pressure is way down so the nozzle is
barely<00:04:01.060> turning<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:01.989> even<00:04:02.290> though<00:04:02.410> it's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
barely turning but even though it's

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.589 
barely turning but even though it's
turning<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.040> slow<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.030> pressures<00:04:04.390> down

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
turning so slow and the pressures down

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.270 
turning so slow and the pressures down
you<00:04:04.900> can<00:04:05.019> see<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.260> effectiveness<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.950> how<00:04:06.130> it

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
you can see the effectiveness of how it

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.819 
you can see the effectiveness of how it
can<00:04:06.400> clean<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:06.640> pipe<00:04:09.989> now<00:04:10.989> as<00:04:11.290> we<00:04:11.470> go<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.680> little

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
can clean a pipe now as we go a little

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.640 
can clean a pipe now as we go a little
bit<00:04:11.980> further<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.640> this<00:04:12.940> video<00:04:13.500> we're<00:04:14.500> going<00:04:14.590> to

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
bit further in this video we're going to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.080 
bit further in this video we're going to
go<00:04:14.799> ahead<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.130> turn<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.400> pressure<00:04:15.610> up<00:04:15.910> on

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
go ahead and turn the pressure up on

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.610 
go ahead and turn the pressure up on
this<00:04:16.269> thing<00:04:16.510> which<00:04:16.780> we<00:04:17.079> can<00:04:17.200> turn<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.470> all<00:04:17.590> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
this thing which we can turn it all the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.879 
this thing which we can turn it all the
way<00:04:17.680> up<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.919> 4000<00:04:18.519> psi<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.150> necessary<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.709> it's

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
way up to 4000 psi if necessary but it's

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.379 
way up to 4000 psi if necessary but it's
not<00:04:21.040> really<00:04:21.250> necessary<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.790> public<00:04:22.180> like

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
not really necessary to public like

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.350 
not really necessary to public like
typically<00:04:22.870> we'll<00:04:23.110> run<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.410> at<00:04:23.530> 3000<00:04:24.130> psi<00:04:24.360> and

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
typically we'll run it at 3000 psi and

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.700 
typically we'll run it at 3000 psi and
we're<00:04:25.690> going<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.840> demonstrate<00:04:26.020> here<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.650> a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
we're going to demonstrate here in a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.300 
we're going to demonstrate here in a
little<00:04:26.830> bit

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
little bit

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.460 
little bit
what<00:04:27.460> 3000<00:04:28.090> psi<00:04:28.210> looks<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.960> inside<00:04:29.290> this

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
what 3000 psi looks like inside this

00:04:29.470 --> 00:05:23.260 
what 3000 psi looks like inside this
pipe

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.570 

this<00:05:24.270> wine<00:05:24.510> had<00:05:24.810> six<00:05:25.800> pounds<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.220> Crisco

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
this wine had six pounds of Crisco

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.460 
this wine had six pounds of Crisco
grease<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.030> about<00:05:27.240> two<00:05:27.660> pounds<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.050> dirt<00:05:28.290> in

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
grease and about two pounds of dirt in

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.140 
grease and about two pounds of dirt in
it<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.340> that's<00:05:29.490> what<00:05:29.640> we<00:05:29.820> used<00:05:30.030> for

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
it and that's what we used for

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.670 
it and that's what we used for
demonstration<00:05:31.730> and<00:05:32.730> I<00:05:32.940> after<00:05:33.120> jetted<00:05:33.680> go

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
demonstration and I after jetted go

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.750 
demonstration and I after jetted go
ahead<00:05:34.920> and<00:05:35.070> we'll<00:05:35.160> show<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.370> we'll<00:05:35.550> take<00:05:35.700> a

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
ahead and we'll show you we'll take a

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.840 
ahead and we'll show you we'll take a
look<00:05:36.000> inside

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
look inside

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.590 
look inside
and<00:05:39.230> as<00:05:40.230> you<00:05:40.440> can<00:05:40.590> see<00:05:40.760> pipe<00:05:41.760> is<00:05:41.940> totally<00:05:42.300> clear

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
and as you can see pipe is totally clear

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.020 
and as you can see pipe is totally clear
and<00:05:42.780> open<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.610> there's<00:05:44.610> going<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:44.760> be<00:05:44.850> no

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
and open and there's going to be no

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.200 
and open and there's going to be no
problem<00:05:45.240> with<00:05:45.450> anything<00:05:45.690> flowing
