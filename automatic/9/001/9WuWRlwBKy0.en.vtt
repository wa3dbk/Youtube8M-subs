00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
stable earned a better version than the

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.059 
stable earned a better version than the
the<00:02:25.120> pocket<00:02:25.450> edition<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.900> yeah<00:02:26.140> that's<00:02:26.620> crazy

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
not because I don't own the game but you

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.659 
not because I don't own the game but you
you<00:02:54.669> now<00:02:54.849> can<00:02:55.120> place<00:02:55.359> them<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.709> they<00:02:56.859> act<00:02:57.459> like

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
you now can place them so they act like

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.020 
you now can place them so they act like
stairs<00:02:58.359> so<00:02:58.659> you<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.900> place<00:02:59.139> them<00:02:59.409> like<00:02:59.739> on<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
stairs so you can place them like on the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.960 
stairs so you can place them like on the
on<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.450> half<00:03:02.169> of<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.889> know<00:03:03.010> block<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.639> you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
on the half of a you know block and you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.849 
on the half of a you know block and you
can<00:03:04.090> play<00:03:04.239> some<00:03:04.299> going<00:03:04.629> upwards<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.650> act

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
can play some going upwards so the act

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.280 
can play some going upwards so the act
like<00:03:06.129> stairs<00:03:06.519> instead<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.909> having<00:03:07.120> stairs<00:03:07.959> and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
like stairs instead of having stairs and

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
think it's the drop physics as when you

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.930 
think it's the drop physics as when you
are<00:03:25.120> mine<00:03:25.599> them<00:03:25.840> they<00:03:26.049> drop<00:03:26.609> now<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.639> don't<00:03:27.849> know

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.659 
you know what that means because I I
obviously<00:03:58.720> don't<00:03:58.959> but<00:03:59.769> yeah<00:04:00.220> probably<00:04:00.489> they

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
obviously don't but yeah probably they

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.969 
obviously don't but yeah probably they
put<00:04:00.819> that<00:04:00.849> in<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:01.349> on<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.470> jump<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.799> I

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
put that in there on the jump and I

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.129 
put that in there on the jump and I
guess<00:04:03.189> that<00:04:03.400> means<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.699> you<00:04:03.790> can<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.959> can

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
guess that means that you can you can

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.360 
guess that means that you can you can
fly<00:04:05.439> higher<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.949> know<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.430> tried<00:04:06.849> out<00:04:06.879> my<00:04:07.329> on<00:04:07.540> my

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
fly higher I know I tried out my on my

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.569 
fly higher I know I tried out my on my
tablet<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.609> think<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.889> it<00:04:11.889> wasn't<00:04:12.129> it<00:04:12.459> wasn't

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
tablet I think and it wasn't it wasn't

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.089 
tablet I think and it wasn't it wasn't
very<00:04:12.790> good<00:04:12.959> how<00:04:13.959> actually<00:04:14.169> I<00:04:14.530> have<00:04:14.829> actually

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
very good how actually I have actually

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.620 
very good how actually I have actually
tried<00:04:15.310> Tupac<00:04:15.549> additional<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.359> when<00:04:16.539> I'm

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
tried Tupac additional and when I'm

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.710 
tried Tupac additional and when I'm
trying<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.900> fly<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.549> Android<00:04:18.970> it's

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
trying to fly on the on the Android it's

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.539 
trying to fly on the on the Android it's
not<00:04:19.930> very<00:04:20.019> good<00:04:20.139> because<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.709> can't<00:04:20.979> you

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549
