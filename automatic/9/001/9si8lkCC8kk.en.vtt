00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 mario leg tonight at 12 o'clock the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 winter mercato or you keep the door 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.020
 well closed in both directions 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 yeah well i think if that in one side 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.289
 remains close I've been awfully 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.410
 pleased that in particular nobody 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 holes especially the key players 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.230
 we still have a x number of players that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 maybe hope to get started somewhere 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 come but there is currently nothing 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.599
 clear about it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.460
 but at least I hope I core 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 intact that is the core where i am 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 though luck two and half years and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.309
 we has a fantastic job and audi 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.290
 almost completely fit 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 Anne have 24 fit players 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.539
 So that means you have to make choices again 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.579
 make yes and I hope at Mechelen the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.110
 to play again so that we 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 can win 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.050
 ok feeling and benches and central post 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.570
 yes luckily thomas 100% fit are you 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.970
 has not yet 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.230
 for 90 minutes the power but there is 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.640
 a boy that I can tooling for a while 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.180
 bring about something in the competition 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.650
 can bring 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.210
 maybe we can take care of 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.810
 3d then everyone will be a while 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.820
 waiting for 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740
 I hope so, because we certainly have that 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.470
 necessary and that everyone understands 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.790
 worst so yes he won't lie 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.619
 your play against the new club tomorrow 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.780
 francs of frank he who had the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.280
 seen a game against gent and found it 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.300
 not bad at all what to genk at the mall 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.619
 brute 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.090
 no good but of course it is one 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.400
 bit contradictory there every time 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 lose and then tend to 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.430
 saying anything is bad but also in it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.410
 I have seen moments with that match with 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.270
 fantastic attacks only those balls 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.100
 must go in and that does not happen then 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.350
 so you're a bit wrong 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.180
 side and then you lack a little bit 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.789
 happiness where I understand he means 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.920
 this is just excellent team with good ones 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.710
 one of our players lacks ours 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970
 little bit of luck that could be there 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.649
 walking around for boys at the moment 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.780
 those with other things in a main base 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.330
 and then candles went to hence it 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.700
 goodies tonight is 12 o'clock because that is 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.920
 means that they only have KRC 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.390
 genk can be busy based on 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.950
 that they are no longer sold to la 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.840
 hope that happens 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.299
 and that everyone focuses on focuses 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.490
 on his job what what what he has to do or 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.540
 must complete him in the team 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.150
 yes then we can hopefully again 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.769
 return to that beautiful phase that we 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.900
 have been fired with 17 west 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.760
 those individual photos that get there 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.260
 but not from you all start again 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 almost with an all-in disadvantage 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.739
 you think that's right and then you can 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 lots of good intentions have march 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.780
 if that kind of thing happens that often yes 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.100
 incomprehensible are abstract 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.019
 yes then you had to go behind your ears 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.209
 crabs because again then give 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.739
 opponent such the feeling of 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.049
 lord is again something to get and with you 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.700
 crawl the bad feeling again 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.989
 in the team 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 can you turn something around for competition 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.550
 tomorrow evening 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.500
 well care about something else 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.120
 I will play thomas for sure 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.520
 come back to basics and everything else 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.420
 but wait until never themselves 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.810

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.030

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.040
 asked how lucky those problems are 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.380
 soaked moritzburg of moss 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.800
 she gets those fossils by no matter how much 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.989

 audience take in paraguay 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.139

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.259

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.849

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.509
 have seen in our constant marshall 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.860
 benji de ceulaer i already live with the 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.389
 press conference inside with a broad 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.529
 smile on your face 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.449
 it will have a lot to do with you 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.370
 weather may think a football 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.960
 yes indeed i am very happy it 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.060
 finally back and flowers 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.860
 was another very difficult one 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.840
 very difficult period for me both 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.819
 mentally as if physically that I mean 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.499
 eh with that injury and then it is like that 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.520
 nice if you then put it on again and half 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.590
 can play along with 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.330
 with the promise and this who I complete 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.710
 can ride with the group 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.509
 yes then it feels grown and then wants to be fine 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.740
 be back on the pitch as quickly as possible 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.569
 on the pitch as quickly as possible 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.189
 also some help I think because it is running 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.990
 not as it should be 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.979
 joya down but i looked that so it is 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.870
 just it's just a hard one 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.879
 difficult moment now and I think of the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.409
 have to go through the day and it is whole 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.699
 too bad you already have an x number 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.229
 losing matches to each other 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.419
 but I am convinced that we 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.860
 with our qualities anyway way back 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.400
 I am on top of coming to anyway 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.900
 convinced 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.999
 What about the atmosphere in the group 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.409
 at the moment the atmosphere in the 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.849
 group is just is just right 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.529
 I mean everybody everybody cares 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.099
 to each other and I think that will be 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.629
 in a group like this and me like me 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.250
 all I see I see also said no 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.990
 boy who fails a bitch 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.310
 or something or that afternoon it is not there anyway 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.870
 I mean everyone fights for it 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.120
 everyone and for the coach and for the 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.550
 club so I think that's very important 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.289
 here is the conductor you go all over 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.210
 look quickly behind 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.800
 due to an individual error 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.419
 indeed and you will never be back 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.060
 come again so that will also be there 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.349
 mentally very resilient and it again 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.969
 is just a great pity that we have the 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.560
 chances we got to you just 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.029
 everyone went and then you get it 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.589
 again the lid the nose that is then again 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.029
 pity and that the period does 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.620
 currently in it 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.839
 there will be some birth left and right 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.339
 at the supporters china understanding for 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.339
 gosh yes I understood and on one side 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.349
 that is that makes sense even though 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.939
 if footballer is of course gone 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.159
 of course fine if you like the 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.550
 mate the sportsmen got mike i get it 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.540
 it does 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.100
 I understand and I mean 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.310
 as if I am a supporter myself and me 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.870
 we will have to go look every week 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.150
 I will lose not favorable 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.040
 but that's why I want to ask again 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.260
 for driver and support from the 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.910
 group i mean to speak for now 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.010
 everyone through 2 and support really needed 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.510
 and until we are very hard anyway 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.510
 work to turn
