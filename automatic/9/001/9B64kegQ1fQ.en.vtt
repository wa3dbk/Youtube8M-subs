00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
hi I'm sandy from the work is getting to

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.130 
hi I'm sandy from the work is getting to
me

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
me

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.880 
me
and<00:00:20.230> right<00:00:20.620> now<00:00:20.800> I'm<00:00:21.160> working<00:00:21.580> on<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:22.890> single

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
and right now I'm working on a single

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.480 
and right now I'm working on a single
for<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.280> three-ply<00:00:24.910> lace<00:00:25.210> weight<00:00:25.450> yarn<00:00:26.490> you'll

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
for a three-ply lace weight yarn you'll

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.350 
for a three-ply lace weight yarn you'll
notice<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.060> it's<00:00:28.270> very<00:00:28.570> fine<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:30.360> there

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
notice that it's very fine and there

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.120 
notice that it's very fine and there
aren't<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.630> lot<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.930> videos<00:00:32.590> on<00:00:32.800> YouTube

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
aren't a lot of videos on YouTube

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.990 
aren't a lot of videos on YouTube
showing<00:00:33.160> how<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.790> spend<00:00:34.120> flying<00:00:34.480> yarn<00:00:34.780> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
showing how to spend flying yarn and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350 
showing how to spend flying yarn and
showing<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.470> close-up<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.030> looks<00:00:40.180> like

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
showing a close-up of what it looks like

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.740 
showing a close-up of what it looks like
to<00:00:40.600> draft<00:00:40.930> something<00:00:42.150> so<00:00:43.150> I<00:00:43.180> thought<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:43.600> would

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
to draft something so I thought I would

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.400 
to draft something so I thought I would
make<00:00:44.050> one<00:00:44.290> myself<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:45.629> taught<00:00:46.629> myself<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:47.110> spin

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
make one myself I taught myself to spin

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.729 
make one myself I taught myself to spin
from<00:00:47.620> YouTube<00:00:47.980> videos<00:00:48.190> so<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.930> hand<00:00:50.199> positions

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
from YouTube videos so my hand positions

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.590 
from YouTube videos so my hand positions
might<00:00:51.309> not<00:00:51.550> look<00:00:51.670> like<00:00:51.730> what<00:00:52.210> you've<00:00:52.360> seen

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
might not look like what you've seen

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.829 
might not look like what you've seen
before<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.940> problems<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.480> learning

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
before one of the problems of learning

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.380 
before one of the problems of learning
from<00:00:56.019> a<00:00:56.140> video<00:00:56.470> that's<00:00:56.949> very<00:00:57.370> blurry<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:58.120> that

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
from a video that's very blurry is that

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.939 
from a video that's very blurry is that
you<00:00:58.570> don't<00:00:58.750> really<00:00:58.960> know<00:00:59.260> if<00:00:59.559> you're<00:00:59.800> doing

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
you don't really know if you're doing

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.920 
you don't really know if you're doing
things<00:01:00.309> right<00:01:00.550> until<00:01:03.330> they<00:01:04.330> start<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.690> work

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
things right until they start to work

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.090 
things right until they start to work
for<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:08.050> technique<00:01:08.470> I'm<00:01:08.620> using<00:01:08.650> right

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
for you so the technique I'm using right

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.730 
for you so the technique I'm using right
now<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.580> somewhere<00:01:10.479> between<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:11.020> long<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
now is somewhere between a long and a

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.660 
now is somewhere between a long and a
short<00:01:11.770> draw<00:01:12.310> you'll<00:01:12.729> notice<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.360> I'm<00:01:14.290> not

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
short draw you'll notice that I'm not

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670 
short draw you'll notice that I'm not
really<00:01:15.670> smoothing<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.420> fibers<00:01:16.870> out<00:01:17.140> with<00:01:17.470> my

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
really smoothing the fibers out with my

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.550 
really smoothing the fibers out with my
right<00:01:17.890> hand<00:01:17.950> as<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.549> go<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.900> I'm<00:01:20.080> also<00:01:20.290> not

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
right hand as I go but I'm also not

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.340 
right hand as I go but I'm also not
drafting<00:01:21.100> all<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.210> way<00:01:22.360> out<00:01:22.570> with<00:01:22.900> my<00:01:23.050> left

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
drafting all the way out with my left

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.610 
drafting all the way out with my left
hand<00:01:23.560> because<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.700> find<00:01:25.660> that<00:01:25.750> with<00:01:25.990> superfine

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
hand because I find that with superfine

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.650 
hand because I find that with superfine
yarns<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:28.650> tend<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.740> lose<00:01:29.920> control<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.730> break

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
yarns you tend to lose control and break

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.170 
yarns you tend to lose control and break
the<00:01:32.380> fiber<00:01:32.650> more<00:01:33.010> at<00:01:33.490> least<00:01:33.730> that<00:01:34.000> might

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
the fiber more at least that might

00:01:34.180 --> 00:02:35.790 
the fiber more at least that might
scalable

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.970
