how am I going to play based on the very

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
limited resources that I have and if I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.940 
limited resources that I have and if I
choose<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> mean

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
choose to do this what does that mean

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
choose to do this what does that mean
for<00:01:28.979> me<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.850> character<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.020> player

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
for me as a character but as a player

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
for me as a character but as a player
because<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:32.009> were<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.400> synonymous<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
because they were so synonymous the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.550 
because they were so synonymous the
relationship<00:01:33.600> between<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.380> don't

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
relationship between that so I don't

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560

no no we would never want to break that

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.780 
no no we would never want to break that
immersion<00:03:15.139> with<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.859> if<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.250> do<00:03:16.549> it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
immersion with you and if we do it's

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.809 
immersion with you and if we do it's
gonna<00:03:16.849> be<00:03:17.000> very<00:03:17.030> specific<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.019> purposeful

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
gonna be very specific and purposeful

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.339 
gonna be very specific and purposeful
but<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.909> fact<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.449> literally<00:03:20.810> go<00:03:21.109> and

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
but the fact that you literally go and

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.860 
but the fact that you literally go and
it<00:03:21.409> looks<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.799> same<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:23.090> know<00:03:23.209> there's<00:03:23.629> some

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
it looks the same you know there's some

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.890 
it looks the same you know there's some
games<00:03:24.139> that<00:03:24.970> gameplay<00:03:25.970> looked<00:03:26.180> one<00:03:26.389> way<00:03:26.419> and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
games that gameplay looked one way and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.800 
games that gameplay looked one way and
the<00:03:27.109> cinematics<00:03:27.889> looked<00:03:28.159> and<00:03:28.430> Greta<00:03:29.120> bowl<00:03:29.479> and

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
the cinematics looked and Greta bowl and

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.059 
the cinematics looked and Greta bowl and
then<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.989> go<00:03:30.139> back<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:30.349> game<00:03:30.650> player<00:03:30.829> like

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
then you go back to game player like

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.159 
then you go back to game player like
whoa<00:03:31.250> that's<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:31.669> that's<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.540> same<00:03:32.780> guy<00:03:32.810> that

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
whoa that's the that's the same guy that

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.789 
whoa that's the that's the same guy that
we<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:33.680> saw<00:03:33.859> so<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.449> I<00:03:35.449> like<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.500> fact<00:03:36.650> that

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
we just saw so I I like the fact that

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.270 
we just saw so I I like the fact that
they<00:03:37.010> have<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.299> focus<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.900> being

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
they have that the the focus is being

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.039 
they have that the the focus is being
immersive<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.489> by<00:03:40.760> doing<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.209> then<00:03:41.900> they

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
immersive and by doing that then they

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.199 
immersive and by doing that then they
apply<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.739> technical<00:03:43.459> way<00:03:43.549> to<00:03:43.609> do<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:43.970> and

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
apply a technical way to do that and

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.430 
apply a technical way to do that and
that's<00:03:44.269> for<00:03:44.540> everything<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.900> be<00:03:44.959> running<00:03:45.199> real

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
that's for everything to be running real

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.149 
that's for everything to be running real
time<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:47.229> engine<00:03:48.229> not<00:03:48.409> not<00:03:48.620> pre-rendered

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
time in engine not not pre-rendered

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.159 
time in engine not not pre-rendered
that's<00:03:49.340> incredible<00:03:49.790> now<00:03:50.510> with<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.840> exception

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
that's incredible now with the exception

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.479 
that's incredible now with the exception
of<00:03:51.199> Metal<00:03:51.440> Gear<00:03:51.500> Solid<00:03:51.769> we're<00:03:52.069> at<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.159> point<00:03:52.370> now

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
of Metal Gear Solid we're at a point now

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.009 
of Metal Gear Solid we're at a point now
where<00:03:52.609> most<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.269> games<00:03:53.510> you've<00:03:53.720> worked<00:03:53.900> on

every<00:04:11.120> time<00:04:11.389> I<00:04:11.419> open<00:04:11.509> up

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
every time I open up

every time I open up
the<00:04:12.320> cases<00:04:13.320> because<00:04:13.710> or<00:04:14.310> do<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.640> digital

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
the cases because or do the digital

the cases because or do the digital
download<00:04:15.360> because<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.590> they<00:04:17.430> were<00:04:17.489> off<00:04:17.730> making

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
download because I they were off making

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.690 
download because I they were off making
it<00:04:18.329> while<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:18.510> was<00:04:18.630> making<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.459> see

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
it while I was making it and to see

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.760 
it while I was making it and to see
things<00:04:20.959> actualized<00:04:21.959> as<00:04:22.290> opposed<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.710> just

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
things actualized as opposed to just

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.410 
things actualized as opposed to just
visualized<00:04:23.520> because<00:04:24.060> that's<00:04:24.210> what<00:04:24.330> we

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
visualized because that's what we

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.690 
visualized because that's what we
typically<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.870> us<00:04:24.990> me<00:04:25.110> okay<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.980> this<00:04:26.550> will

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
typically get us me okay this this will

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.850 
typically get us me okay this this will
eventually<00:04:26.850> be<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.510> long<00:04:27.750> tower<00:04:28.290> okay<00:04:28.710> and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
eventually be this long tower okay and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.770 
eventually be this long tower okay and
sour<00:04:29.100> on<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.430> going<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.670> be<00:04:29.760> about<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.270> huh

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
sour on is going to be about this huh

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.630 
sour on is going to be about this huh
you<00:04:31.080> know<00:04:31.200> we<00:04:31.560> never<00:04:31.710> get<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.950> fully<00:04:32.190> see<00:04:32.520> it

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
you know we never get to fully see it

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.460 
you know we never get to fully see it
and<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.120> when<00:04:33.300> when<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.780> actually<00:04:33.960> get<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.260> play
