hey<00:00:00.630> everyone<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.260> thought<00:00:01.589> I'd<00:00:01.709> show<00:00:01.860> you<00:00:01.890> my

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hey everyone I thought I'd show you my

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.910 
hey everyone I thought I'd show you my
latest<00:00:02.280> project<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> new<00:00:04.140> vacuum<00:00:04.410> cart

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
latest project this is a new vacuum cart

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.710 
latest project this is a new vacuum cart
that<00:00:05.069> I'm<00:00:05.190> building<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.850> eventually<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.359> plan

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
that I'm building and eventually I plan

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.020 
that I'm building and eventually I plan
to<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:07.049> physical<00:00:07.620> vapor<00:00:07.890> deposition<00:00:08.040> inside

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
to do physical vapor deposition inside

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.049 
to do physical vapor deposition inside
there<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> really<00:00:10.740> high<00:00:11.460> current

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
there so with a really high current

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.660 
there so with a really high current
heater<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.170> evaporate<00:00:13.440> materials<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
heater you can evaporate materials in a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.870 
heater you can evaporate materials in a
vacuum<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.599> then<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> materials

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
vacuum and then have the materials

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.910 
vacuum and then have the materials
solidify<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> flat<00:00:18.420> surface<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:19.710> my

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
solidify on a flat surface so my

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.220 
solidify on a flat surface so my
ultimate<00:00:20.279> goal<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> either<00:00:21.390> optical

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
ultimate goal here is to either optical

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220 
ultimate goal here is to either optical
coatings<00:00:22.680> or<00:00:22.949> thin<00:00:23.250> film<00:00:23.519> transistors<00:00:24.240> or<00:00:24.630> any

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
coatings or thin film transistors or any

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
coatings or thin film transistors or any
number<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.560> other<00:00:25.680> cool<00:00:25.980> things<00:00:26.269> also

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
number of other cool things also

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
number of other cool things also
prepping<00:00:27.840> samples<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> scanning

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
prepping samples for the scanning

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.529 
prepping samples for the scanning
electron<00:00:29.429> microscope<00:00:30.000> would<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.330> another

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
electron microscope would be another

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.810 
electron microscope would be another
good<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.279> let<00:00:32.430> me<00:00:32.520> show<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> how

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
good use of this so let me show you how

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.790 
good use of this so let me show you how
I<00:00:32.850> did<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
I did it

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
I did it
the<00:00:34.800> wooden<00:00:35.100> cart<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.059> cheap<00:00:36.270> IKEA

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the wooden cart is just a cheap IKEA

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
the wooden cart is just a cheap IKEA
cart<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> got<00:00:37.440> locally<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> sometimes

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
cart that I got locally and sometimes

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.090 
cart that I got locally and sometimes
working<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.450> wood<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> easier<00:00:40.680> than<00:00:40.800> metal

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
working with wood is easier than metal

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
working with wood is easier than metal
just<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.610> easier<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> drill<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
just because it's easier to drill and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
just because it's easier to drill and
the<00:00:43.140> tolerances<00:00:43.620> aren't<00:00:43.860> quite<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.160> tight

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the tolerances aren't quite as tight

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
the tolerances aren't quite as tight
however<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.539> had<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> cheap<00:00:46.050> source<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.680> cheap

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
however if I had a cheap source a cheap

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.430 
however if I had a cheap source a cheap
reliable<00:00:47.160> local<00:00:48.000> source<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.539> metal<00:00:48.989> carts

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
reliable local source of metal carts

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200 
reliable local source of metal carts
kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.980> used<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> sound<00:00:50.879> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
kind of like I used for the sound I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.490 
kind of like I used for the sound I
would<00:00:52.079> use<00:00:52.350> those<00:00:52.590> instead<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> metal<00:00:55.230> plate

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
would use those instead the metal plate

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
would use those instead the metal plate
is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> one-inch<00:00:56.010> thick<00:00:56.489> piece<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.969> aluminum

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is a one-inch thick piece of aluminum

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
is a one-inch thick piece of aluminum
which<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.600> probably<00:00:58.050> overkill<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.649> there's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
which is probably overkill that there's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 
which is probably overkill that there's
some<00:00:59.160> benefits<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.760> using<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.300> nice<00:01:00.780> thick

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
some benefits of using a nice thick

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
some benefits of using a nice thick
piece<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.340> main<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.730> being<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> can

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
piece the main one being that you can

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.109 
piece the main one being that you can
drill<00:01:03.629> blind<00:01:03.960> holes<00:01:04.320> into<00:01:04.680> either<00:01:04.799> side<00:01:05.220> tap

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
drill blind holes into either side tap

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
drill blind holes into either side tap
the<00:01:06.330> holes<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.140> those<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.790> support

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the holes and then use those as support

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
the holes and then use those as support
points<00:01:09.240> without<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.320> through<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
points without going through the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
points without going through the
material<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> plate<00:01:12.270> were<00:01:12.420> only<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
material so if the plate were only a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
material so if the plate were only a
quarter-inch<00:01:13.080> thick<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.340> couldn't

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
quarter-inch thick you really couldn't

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
quarter-inch thick you really couldn't
drill<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> blind<00:01:15.210> hole<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.049> going

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
drill a blind hole because you be going

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.109 
drill a blind hole because you be going
through<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> other<00:01:17.040> side<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.670> you'd<00:01:17.820> only<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
through the other side or you'd only be

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.840 
through the other side or you'd only be
able<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.659> 1/8<00:01:18.990> inches<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
able to get you know 1/8 inches of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.560 
able to get you know 1/8 inches of
engagement<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.180> isn't<00:01:21.360> quite

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
engagement there which isn't quite

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.859 
engagement there which isn't quite
enough<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.880> today<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> machine<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> plate

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
enough so today I machine to the plate

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.280 
enough so today I machine to the plate
and<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:26.070> involves<00:01:26.549> using<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.180> large<00:01:27.750> fit<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and that involves using a large fit to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.920 
and that involves using a large fit to
cut<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> couple<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> holes<00:01:29.659> let<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.840> if

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
cut out a couple of holes let me know if

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
cut out a couple of holes let me know if
you<00:01:31.020> wanted<00:01:31.200> me<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> tutorial<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
you wanted me to do a like a tutorial on

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.160 
you wanted me to do a like a tutorial on
machining<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.509> don't<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> haven't<00:01:33.960> done<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
machining I don't know I haven't done a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.740 
machining I don't know I haven't done a
tutorial<00:01:34.470> video<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.310> while<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.600> let<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.659> know

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
tutorial video in a while so let me know

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.410 
tutorial video in a while so let me know
if<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.110> interesting<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> guys

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
if that would be interesting to you guys

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
if that would be interesting to you guys
and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.930> cut<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> gland<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> o-ring

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and then I cut a gland for the o-ring

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
and then I cut a gland for the o-ring
which<00:01:42.150> will<00:01:42.329> seal<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> diffusion<00:01:43.740> pump<00:01:43.920> which

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
which will seal the diffusion pump which

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
there's actually originally when I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.649 
there's actually originally when I
started<00:01:56.930> making<00:01:57.790> oring<00:01:58.790> seals<00:01:59.180> I<00:01:59.390> would<00:01:59.510> make

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
started making oring seals I would make

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.930 
started making oring seals I would make
the<00:01:59.810> glans<00:02:00.080> way<00:02:00.380> too<00:02:00.440> small<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.850> is

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
the glans way too small and this is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.219 
the glans way too small and this is
actually<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> problem<00:02:02.510> because<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.020> need

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
actually a problem because you need

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.200 
actually a problem because you need

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
has nowhere to squeeze into and you

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.490 
has nowhere to squeeze into and you
actually<00:02:07.580> end<00:02:07.850> up<00:02:07.970> with<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:09.110> good<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.410> a

thing I have connected right now is a
penning<00:02:26.660> gage<00:02:26.690> which<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.800> refurbished<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.489> an

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
penning gage which I refurbished in an

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.410 
penning gage which I refurbished in an
earlier<00:02:28.880> video<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.950> penning<00:02:30.950> gage<00:02:31.420> reads

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
earlier video the penning gage reads

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.479 
earlier video the penning gage reads
from<00:02:32.810> about<00:02:33.140> ten<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.709> ten<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.340> negative

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
from about ten to ten to the negative

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.220 
from about ten to ten to the negative
seven<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.510> ten<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.530> negative<00:02:36.680> three<00:02:36.950> about

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.559 

so<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.189> pumps<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:44.610> been<00:02:44.640> running<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:45.510> about

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
so the pumps have been running for about

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.649 
so the pumps have been running for about
an<00:02:45.810> hour<00:02:45.870> total<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:47.189> roughing<00:02:48.090> pump<00:02:48.239> has<00:02:48.480> run

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
an hour total the roughing pump has run

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.660 
an hour total the roughing pump has run
for<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:49.049> 15<00:02:49.409> or<00:02:49.530> 20<00:02:49.560> minutes<00:02:49.829> first<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
for about 15 or 20 minutes first and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.039 
for about 15 or 20 minutes first and
then<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.849> diffusion<00:02:51.060> pump<00:02:51.390> was<00:02:51.599> switched<00:02:51.840> on

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
then the diffusion pump was switched on

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.709 
then the diffusion pump was switched on
and<00:02:52.489> after<00:02:53.489> about<00:02:53.640> an<00:02:53.760> hour<00:02:53.849> total<00:02:54.269> we're<00:02:54.569> down

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:54.719 
and after about an hour total we're down

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.209 
and after about an hour total we're down
to<00:02:54.959> about<00:02:54.989> ten<00:02:55.439> to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> negative<00:02:55.769> five

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
a water bath hole to keep oil from the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.830 
a water bath hole to keep oil from the
diffusion<00:03:38.159> pump<00:03:38.370> from<00:03:39.000> getting<00:03:39.299> back<00:03:39.480> up<00:03:39.510> into

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
diffusion pump from getting back up into

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.869 
diffusion pump from getting back up into
the<00:03:39.959> chamber<00:03:40.379> if<00:03:41.159> you're<00:03:41.310> unfamiliar<00:03:41.730> with

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
the chamber if you're unfamiliar with

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.360 
the chamber if you're unfamiliar with
these<00:03:42.030> they<00:03:42.269> work<00:03:42.450> by<00:03:42.689> boiling<00:03:43.500> oil<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
these they work by boiling oil in the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.699 
these they work by boiling oil in the
bottom<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:44.939> container<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.530> that

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
bottom of the container and then that

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.039 
bottom of the container and then that
oil<00:03:46.950> vapor<00:03:47.280> rises<00:03:47.940> up<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.269> top<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.810> comes

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
oil vapor rises up to the top and comes

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.259 
oil vapor rises up to the top and comes
out<00:03:49.199> of<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.409> jet<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.549> way<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.669> it<00:03:50.940> actually

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
out of a jet so the way that it actually

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.469 
out of a jet so the way that it actually
creates<00:03:52.079> vacuum<00:03:52.379> is<00:03:52.889> by<00:03:53.129> sort<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.090> spraying

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
creates vacuum is by sort of spraying

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.210 
creates vacuum is by sort of spraying
the<00:03:54.720> air<00:03:54.840> molecules<00:03:55.079> out<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:55.979> chamber

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
the air molecules out of the chamber

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.819 
the air molecules out of the chamber
with<00:03:56.669> this<00:03:56.849> oil<00:03:57.060> jet<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.409> like<00:03:58.590> blowing

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
with this oil jet think of like blowing

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.879 
with this oil jet think of like blowing
away<00:03:59.159> dry<00:03:59.459> leaves<00:03:59.729> with<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.209> garden<00:04:00.629> hose

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
away dry leaves with like a garden hose

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.409 
away dry leaves with like a garden hose
same<00:04:01.889> basic<00:04:02.220> idea<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.729> like<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.909> momentum

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
same basic idea it's like a momentum

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.960 
same basic idea it's like a momentum
transfer<00:04:03.930> pump

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.020 

okay<00:04:07.970> see<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.660> next<00:04:08.900> time
