00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.840
 order picking systems according to the principle of the product 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.250
 towards the operator are increasingly used in logistics concepts 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.209
 current 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.049
 the most widespread system 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.560
 and the automatic store a vital systems tray 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 before she 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.640
 which current facilities are recorded with individual locations 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.480
 for barak 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.680
 or places for tray filled with several bins for the household in 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.700
 different compartments the system always offers a possibility of 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.610
 storage 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.080
 very compact 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.440
 transfers that serve these racking facilities 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.240
 we have very high yields 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.960
 thanks to their lightweight construction and control mechanisms 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.210
 modern settings what is needed to continually supply the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.030
 work stations of the evacuators evacuated the 28 m 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.320
 in addition to a significant saving of the occupied surface compared to the solutions 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.140
 conventional 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.949
 an installation in calais 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.070
 also has advantages in terms of information and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 levies 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.200
 to note the travel times without reduction of more than 80% 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.590
 each reference is immediately taxed target 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.450
 thanks to the extremely short access time the output of the preparation 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.670
 of orders and considerably increase 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.320
 thanks to the high rack construction it is possible to realize 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 optimal use of the premises 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 and to obtain a high density of filling 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.530
 computerized stock management and the good general organization which in 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.430
 results 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.950
 guarantee is a very good availability of each item store 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 as well as a permanent control of the stock 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 closed systems prevent any access from allowing products 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.390
 stored 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.009
 among the benefits and wheels of the system 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.620
 the store automatic bittorrent attacks 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.440
 also generates serious savings 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.080
 the different scale widths of 30 45 or 60 millimeters 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.760
 allow it to be adapted to travis charging capacities and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 different dimensions 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.579
 the setting of the scales at 25 mm system pitch allows 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.579
 to use the entire height of warehouses 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.999
 the respect of manufacturing tolerance and minimal assembly 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.219
 it guarantees optimal operation of the installation 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.289
 and the carrier integrated into the system 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.320
 as a producer of shelving systems 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.600
 as well as bins and containers biteau is able to provide facilities 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.799
 aka she completely equipped 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.749
 the bins and tray were specially designed for its system 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.009
 storage 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.109
 and harmonize perfectly with shelves and carriers 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.829
 the games of the series is called 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.259
 eric haik 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:03.449
 as well as the steel but polypropylene trays used for 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.819
 automatic stores 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.229
 meet the most varied needs 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.979
 depending on the characteristics of the items to be stored and the inter France team 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:15.159
 the automatic magazine shot down maybe in six for storage 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.979
 single or double depth 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.150
 my individual location system to multi 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.529
 advise for more than 17000 site for plateau in massy and 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.249
 it seems quality for a small material 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.299
 the solution presented here 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.799
 and brings together all the advantages of an automatic kanak la 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.079
 order picking without error 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.739
 and very short deadlines 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.739
 they guarantee the efficiency of the system 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.579
 thanks to this efficiency its bittorrent clients can process the 55000 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.999
 comment per month 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:56.729
 in addition the installation still has a storage capacity in reserve 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.529
 for a future enlargement
