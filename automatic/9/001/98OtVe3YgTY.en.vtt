 It turned out that because of these bolts, I 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 how would decide not to unscrew them too lazy 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.260

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.689
 made out decided to capture it all by 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.000
 after three years how it all looks 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.590
 Well, here's another on the lawn I cooked a frame there 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.079
 Unfortunately the photos were not saved 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.010
 I lost my camera and photos 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:44.930
 lost there in general a piece of the frame was not 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.930
 such here that is an overlay too did 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.680
 only from the outside did 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.050
 pad and there it is a piece of sulfur there 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.459
 here inside nakladochka of a piece of Schiller 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.370
 done and according to Schiller 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.730
 katanas they are inside of course well you would 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.880
 the best bent channel at that moment did not 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.940
 It was and the cat to the north took as it were 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.280
 corner he has a sharp corner well like 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.350
 katanova ram goods mayskogo committed 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.970
 he seems to be such a circle that is there 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.329
 Bulgarian from the means and that it is tight 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.240
 tight became pulled bent on us 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.200
 the moment of welding bolts pulled 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.440
 Somewhat new are better, of course. 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.650
 bolt-pull in addition to 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.770
 bolting is better at several places 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.640
 I just use the lawn 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.479
 Russian bolts 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:44.290
 this gas 3307 is cardan bolts 3307 and 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.080
 they are 12 millimeters well for them 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.700
 hole nipple but the bolts are very good 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.669
 in quality, that is, you can draw 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.780
 very powerful and they attract very 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:59.080
 it's good not to break anything 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.630
 costs quite cheap at 15 rubles then 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.870
 there is like this 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.680
 the frame must be cooked now since 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.020
 We are talking about 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.520
 brew frame and so I still have to this 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.720
 strange brewed frame do not know how here 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.720
 not visible 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.010
 here it was, there was a crack before the court 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.320
 the top shelf it cracks enough by 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.740
 top shelf 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.500
 not pay unfortunately will be there too to 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.370
 The little girl is worth the same 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.590
 bitches but also like g-shaped that is 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.560
 she comes here and the court that is here 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.310
 G-shaped will find the same scarf as well 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.100
 so she goes here quite so so not there 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.940
 I do not podliz here 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.010
 front beam baked and muffler so 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.320
 I have found that I have to believe it 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:03.210
 last year I also cooked with 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.830
 like nowhere else in the order does not go 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.830
 that the frame is cooked like this
