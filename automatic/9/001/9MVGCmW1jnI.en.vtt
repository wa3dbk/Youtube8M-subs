this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:04.040> solution<00:00:05.720> from<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> ceramics

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
this is the solution from the ceramics

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.480 
this is the solution from the ceramics
I've<00:00:09.300> got<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.630> set<00:00:09.870> out<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> catch<00:00:10.679> pan<00:00:11.070> so

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I've got it set out of the catch pan so

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.200 
I've got it set out of the catch pan so
I<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.700> get<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> good<00:00:12.030> picture<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:14.150> I've<00:00:15.150> got

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I can get a good picture of it I've got

steals off our post of the of the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.300 
steals off our post of the of the
processed<00:03:32.640> bodies<00:03:33.120> they<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.900> they<00:03:34.590> went<00:03:35.190> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
processed bodies they all they went to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.190 
processed bodies they all they went to
completion<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:38.420> milk<00:03:39.420> them<00:03:39.630> for<00:03:39.660> everything

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
completion I milk them for everything

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.680 
completion I milk them for everything
they<00:03:40.350> had<00:03:41.030> then<00:03:42.980> after<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.910> dissolution<00:03:45.300> was

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
they had then after the dissolution was

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.400 
they had then after the dissolution was
complete<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.320> i<00:03:46.830> filtered<00:03:47.310> i<00:03:47.550> went<00:03:48.450> back<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.450 

did<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.470> little<00:03:52.710> hydrochloric<00:03:54.590> chlorine<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:56.040> it

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
did a little hydrochloric chlorine on it

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.800 
did a little hydrochloric chlorine on it
and<00:03:56.580> got<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> little<00:03:56.970> more<00:03:57.210> out<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.180> i

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
and got a little more out of it so i

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.210 
and got a little more out of it so i
believe<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:02.420> what's<00:04:03.420> left<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.320> pretty

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
believe that what's left is is pretty

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.940 
believe that what's left is is pretty
much<00:04:05.400> played<00:04:05.760> out

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.770 

so<00:04:11.950> I'm<00:04:12.100> going<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.280> let<00:04:12.460> this<00:04:12.610> settle<00:04:12.970> I'm

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
so I'm going to let this settle I'm

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.229 
so I'm going to let this settle I'm
going<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.990> put<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.170> back<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.530> catch<00:04:14.770> pin

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
going to put it back in the catch pin

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.740 
going to put it back in the catch pin
and<00:04:16.239> I'm<00:04:16.420> going<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.720> let<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:16.959> settle<00:04:18.450> all<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
and I'm going to let it settle all the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.050 
and I'm going to let it settle all the
silver<00:04:20.110> chloride<00:04:20.350> will<00:04:20.799> settle<00:04:21.040> out<00:04:21.280> then

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
silver chloride will settle out then

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.520 
silver chloride will settle out then
I'll<00:04:22.210> filter<00:04:22.630> again<00:04:24.540> I'm<00:04:25.540> suspecting<00:04:26.470> that

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
I'll filter again I'm suspecting that

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.980 
I'll filter again I'm suspecting that
there<00:04:26.860> could<00:04:27.160> be<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.730> little<00:04:28.150> free<00:04:28.360> nitric<00:04:28.840> in

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
there could be a little free nitric in

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.630 
there could be a little free nitric in
there<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:31.500> i'll<00:04:32.500> test<00:04:32.890> that<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.340> morning

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
there and i'll test that in the morning

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.580 
there and i'll test that in the morning
if<00:04:33.790> there<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:37.050> instead<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.110> trying<00:04:38.500> to

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
if there is instead of trying to

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.770 
if there is instead of trying to
neutralize<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:40.590> some<00:04:41.590> other<00:04:41.740> manner<00:04:42.780> I'm

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
neutralize in some other manner I'm

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.090 
neutralize in some other manner I'm
thinking<00:04:44.020> about<00:04:44.380> using<00:04:44.620> some<00:04:44.980> foils<00:04:45.460> out<00:04:45.670> of

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
thinking about using some foils out of

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.560 
thinking about using some foils out of
out<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.160> those<00:04:48.430> legs<00:04:48.790> from<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.910> green<00:04:51.910> basis

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
out of those legs from the green basis

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.810 
out of those legs from the green basis
but<00:04:53.410> I'd<00:04:53.590> really<00:04:53.740> like<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.070> get<00:04:54.340> some<00:04:54.520> yield

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
but I'd really like to get some yield

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.030 
but I'd really like to get some yield
that<00:04:55.150> on<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:55.600> I'd<00:04:56.500> hate<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.740> use<00:04:57.100> that<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:59.040> I

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
that on that I'd hate to use that but I

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.070 
that on that I'd hate to use that but I
really<00:05:00.850> really<00:05:01.240> need<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.870> get<00:05:02.020> this

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
really really need to get this

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.210 
really really need to get this
neutralized<00:05:03.900> without<00:05:05.010> adding<00:05:06.010> any<00:05:06.160> more

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
neutralized without adding any more

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.930 
neutralized without adding any more
complications<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.360> process<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.940> if<00:05:10.180> i<00:05:10.540> can

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
complications to the process so if i can

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.630
