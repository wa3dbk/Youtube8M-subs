texture and I really like it because it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
what everyone has been doing

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.490 
what everyone has been doing
on<00:02:26.580> YouTube<00:02:26.850> lately<00:02:27.120> Ellie's<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.110> mostly

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
on YouTube lately Ellie's for mostly

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.850 
on YouTube lately Ellie's for mostly
beauty<00:02:28.950> girls<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.260> did<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
beauty girls and then I just did the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.310 
beauty girls and then I just did the
same<00:02:31.890> thing<00:02:32.340> again<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.750> guess<00:02:34.110> I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
same thing again because I guess I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.200 
same thing again because I guess I
didn't<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.130> first<00:02:35.340> time<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:36.060> want

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
didn't like it the first time and I want

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.270 
didn't like it the first time and I want
to<00:02:36.270> make<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> pop<00:02:36.750> even<00:02:37.020> more<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.830> don't<00:02:38.130> know

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
to make it pop even more I don't know

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.310 
to make it pop even more I don't know
you<00:02:38.850> can<00:02:39.000> choose<00:02:39.210> whatever<00:02:39.420> color<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.170> prefer

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
you can choose whatever color you prefer

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.010 
you can choose whatever color you prefer
and<00:02:40.800> then<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> went<00:02:41.250> over<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.810> pink<00:02:42.810> one

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
and then I went over it with a pink one

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.690 
and then I went over it with a pink one
and<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:43.710> see<00:02:43.770> if<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> don't<00:02:44.400> turn<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and as you can see if you don't turn the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820 
and as you can see if you don't turn the
harness<00:02:45.060> down<00:02:45.240> it's<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.810> zero<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.380> gonna<00:02:46.530> be

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
harness down it's to zero it's gonna be

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.290 
harness down it's to zero it's gonna be
really<00:02:47.070> weird<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.880> turn<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.210> a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
really weird but you can turn it a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.120 
really weird but you can turn it a
little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.690> high<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.140> want<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.860> all

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
little bit high if you want it's all

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.820 
little bit high if you want it's all
personal<00:02:50.430> preference<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:52.320> did<00:02:52.560> that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
personal preference but I just did that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.010 
personal preference but I just did that
and<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.730> went<00:02:54.120> over<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.780> white

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
and then I went over it with like white

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.410 
and then I went over it with like white
one<00:02:55.230> which<00:02:55.380> I'll<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.590> kind<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.420> really

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
one which I'll just kind of like really

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.910 
one which I'll just kind of like really
mess<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.780> up<00:02:57.900> because<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.320> didn't<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.740> care

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
mess it up because I didn't really care

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.750 
mess it up because I didn't really care
so<00:02:59.610> um<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:01.080> extra<00:03:01.710> little<00:03:01.980> thing<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.520> went

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so um for the extra little thing I went

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.940 
so um for the extra little thing I went
over<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.150> down<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> image<00:03:03.690> from<00:03:04.110> Google<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
over and down the image from Google and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.240 
over and down the image from Google and
then<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.900> put<00:03:07.380> them<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:07.860> which<00:03:08.040> was

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
then I just put them in there which was

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.820 
then I just put them in there which was
a<00:03:08.430> picture<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> Lulu<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.630> cake<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.590> just

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
a picture of Lulu and a cake and I just

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.890 
a picture of Lulu and a cake and I just
went<00:03:11.010> over<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> same<00:03:11.640> glowy<00:03:12.390> thing

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
went over it with the same glowy thing

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.560 
went over it with the same glowy thing
to<00:03:13.230> make<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.740> balloon<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> cake<00:03:14.970> pop<00:03:15.270> out

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
to make the balloon and the cake pop out

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.840 
to make the balloon and the cake pop out
because<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.170> goes<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.410> with<00:03:16.530> hosting<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> then

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
because it goes on with hosting and then

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.280 
because it goes on with hosting and then
you<00:03:17.970> just<00:03:18.120> want<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.270> save<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> computer

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you just want to save it to a computer

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.510 
you just want to save it to a computer
and<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:24.620> okay<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.010> second<00:03:26.400> method

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
and that is it okay so the second method

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.400 
and that is it okay so the second method
that<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.300> use<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.750> by<00:03:28.050> going<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
that I like to use is by going to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.550 
that I like to use is by going to
overlays<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.280> picking<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:30.200> rectangle<00:03:31.200> from<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
overlays and picking a rectangle from a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.800 
overlays and picking a rectangle from a
geometric<00:03:31.950> section<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.209> pick<00:03:33.570> like

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
geometric section and you can pick like

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.530 
geometric section and you can pick like
a<00:03:33.840> circle<00:03:34.410> triangle<00:03:34.770> heart<00:03:35.459> it's<00:03:35.790> whatever

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
a circle triangle heart it's whatever

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.800 
a circle triangle heart it's whatever
you<00:03:36.780> want<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.650> basically<00:03:38.430> wrote<00:03:39.150> what<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810

you want and I basically wrote what I
got<00:03:40.020> from<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.230> 15th<00:03:40.590> birthday<00:03:40.740> again<00:03:41.280> because

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
got from a 15th birthday again because

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.670 
got from a 15th birthday again because
that's<00:03:42.000> my<00:03:42.240> title<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.230> made<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.470> say<00:03:43.650> that

that's my title and I made it say that
and<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.610> basically<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.150> went<00:03:45.540> over<00:03:45.750> it

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
and that is basically I went over it

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.810 
and that is basically I went over it
with<00:03:45.870> another<00:03:46.320> different<00:03:47.070> font<00:03:47.310> later<00:03:47.550> and

with another different font later and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.330 
with another different font later and
adjusted<00:03:48.270> my<00:03:48.390> side<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.050> turned<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.410> color<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
adjusted my side and I turned a color to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.400 
adjusted my side and I turned a color to
white<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.000> they<00:03:51.150> pop<00:03:51.360> out<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.810> black<00:03:52.110> or

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
white so they pop out on the black or

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.690 
white so they pop out on the black or
you<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.740> do<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> opposite<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.459> you're<00:03:53.640> done

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
transparent and I made some cosmic

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.220 
transparent and I made some cosmic
bubbles<00:04:56.100> which<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.610> what<00:04:57.120> appears<00:04:57.540> on<00:04:57.960> the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
bubbles which is what appears on the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.660 
bubbles which is what appears on the
actual<00:04:58.800> thing<00:04:58.980> you<00:04:59.100> don't<00:04:59.220> have<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.490> make

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
actual thing you don't have to make

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.310
