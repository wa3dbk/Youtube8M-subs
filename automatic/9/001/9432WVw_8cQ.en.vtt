00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 the premise is in fact the premise of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 neuro semantics is that there is a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 structure for three miles and to the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.219
 genius and how a structure is 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.090
 It is possible that we can replicate this 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.219
 structure opening an avenue in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.350
 excellence 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.140
 we realize, for example, people 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.360
 It talks about one of genius we think 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 in thomas edison we still think 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.980
 25 jobs 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.449
 but all of them if you go to study 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 each of them you see that you have a 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.609
 structure and once this structure 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 learned any of us 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.640
 you can start to develop this 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.140
 structure the state of genius itself is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.740
 a state of absolute and absolute focus is not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.710
 a state of flower is a state of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.650
 flow where you are there 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.990
 totally lost in that moment 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.780
 lost in the sense of integer not 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 disappears, time disappears, hunger you 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.770
 stay there whole 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.270
 in fact we already experience it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.210
 We esperiÃªncia people is this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 stroll through this state along the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.579
 our day 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.159
 at various times when, for example, 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.470
 people are reading a book you are there 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.409
 doing that reading is immersed 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.320
 inside that story and the world 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.329
 disappears when we are seeing a 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.390
 Good movie, this can happen too. 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.780
 in this whole world you fall and you neither 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.369
 notices or ran runners 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 speaks very much to all 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.009
 athletes will talk about this state of flux 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.349
 of this state of genius is of a form 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.870
 very natural 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.459
 therefore we have already seen 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.549
 this space but without any 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.129
 conscience and no purpose 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.830
 The interesting thing is to get exactly this 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.299
 structure along obviously with pre 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.700
 requirements that we are going to talk about here 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.810
 and to develop this structure of 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.810
 master of the genre 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 Actually, I'll talk a little bit about the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.909
 prerequisites neodi some pre 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.680
 requirements such as focus 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.780
 in love 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.780
 what is the passionate focus is a passion 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.950
 clearly focused on something that one has 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.870
 total interest or that is what I 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.599
 I want this is what interests me in this 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.959
 Mom, I'm all doing this here. 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.720
 along with this comes the flexibility 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.000
 awareness that the possibility 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.359
 exactly of being able to see the same thing 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.209
 from several different angles 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:15.590
 the first position second position 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.470
 third place is versa anyway and together 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.280
 with this the ease that people 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.200
 develops with changing 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.510
 emotional change is mental change 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.480
 flexibility of consciousness that this 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.569
 flexibility to deal with your 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.569
 own conscience and socially 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.379
 connected to people think the agent has 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.959
 one created a stereotype that the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:48.109
 genius is someone who is there alone 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:53.180
 creating not a genius is socially 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:55.669
 connected to it he has collaborators 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.299
 he has people who are helping to 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:04.790
 that he can develop this genius 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:08.810
 reality and resilience is not 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.410
 let nothing down you down 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.780
 enjoy all experiences 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.209
 including failures as feedback 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.659
 Imagine if thomas edson 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.080
 third or by the hundredth attempt 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.630
 I would have said to make this lamp 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.660
 lit 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.410
 it's plate things, how can we 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.590
 would be until now, so resilience is 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.790
 keep the focus on swimming and not allow 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:45.870
 Nothing, Jorge, you down. 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:49.530
 so some prerequisites are 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.920
 doing the act means going into a 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.810
 great process of self-knowledge 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.310
 means developing the prerequisites 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.180
 of the state of genius but means 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.540
 much more than that because it means 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.500
 to perform or to do that 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:15.120
 What do you say ending up with the gap? 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.760
 between knowing and doing and at that moment 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.610
 that we close this gap to people 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.660
 start walking the auto path 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.270
 achievement 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.270
 you are ready to be autorrealiza
