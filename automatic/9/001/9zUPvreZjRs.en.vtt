00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.289 
think is manipulating at them these big
banks<00:01:09.710> no<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.400> combination<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
banks no I think it's a combination of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
banks no I think it's a combination of
the<00:01:12.450> US<00:01:12.750> Federal<00:01:13.140> Reserve<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.159> us

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the US Federal Reserve which is not us

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
the US Federal Reserve which is not us
as<00:01:14.850> no<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.560> bank

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
as no it's not it's not really a bank

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.050 
as no it's not it's not really a bank
plus<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.720> government<00:01:18.930> plus<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.310> big<00:01:20.520> bankers

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
plus the government plus the big bankers

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
plus the government plus the big bankers
so<00:01:21.330> there's<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> lot<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> people<00:01:22.320> who<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.650> to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
hyperinflation which means more

hyperinflation which means more
inflation<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.720> means<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.440> me

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
inflation what that means to you and me

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.020 
inflation what that means to you and me
is<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:52.040> things<00:03:52.340> will<00:03:52.520> get<00:03:52.640> more<00:03:52.880> expensive

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
is that things will get more expensive

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.220 
is that things will get more expensive
and<00:03:54.520> it<00:03:55.520> really<00:03:55.760> bothers<00:03:56.330> me<00:03:56.510> personally<00:03:56.540> I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and it really bothers me personally I

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.350 
and it really bothers me personally I
have<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.010> many<00:03:58.100> people<00:03:58.430> afraid<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.970> losing<00:03:59.270> the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
have so many people afraid of losing the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.720 
have so many people afraid of losing the
jobs<00:03:59.600> or<00:03:59.780> lost<00:04:00.080> their<00:04:00.260> jobs<00:04:00.530> housing<00:04:01.130> values

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
jobs or lost their jobs housing values

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.940 
jobs or lost their jobs housing values
are<00:04:01.910> down<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.390> think<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.930> biggest<00:04:03.230> change<00:04:03.740> of

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
are down I think the biggest change of

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.650 
are down I think the biggest change of
all<00:04:04.130> that's<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.760> we're<00:04:04.910> going<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.120> see<00:04:05.390> from

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
all that's that we're going to see from

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.430 
all that's that we're going to see from
now<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.220> us<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.450> people<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.170> US

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
now on is the us the people of the US

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.410 
now on is the us the people of the US
could<00:04:09.710> no<00:04:09.860> longer<00:04:09.890> use<00:04:10.310> their<00:04:10.820> house<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.300> an

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
could no longer use their house as an

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.260 
could no longer use their house as an
ATM<00:04:11.890> because<00:04:12.890> credit<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.460> so<00:04:13.670> tight<00:04:13.970> right<00:04:14.240> now

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
ATM because credit is so tight right now

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.210 
ATM because credit is so tight right now
so<00:04:14.720> that's<00:04:14.870> going<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.080> keep<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.470> economy<00:04:15.710> flat

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
so that's going to keep the economy flat

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.479 
so that's going to keep the economy flat
so<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.519> wouldn't<00:04:16.970> be<00:04:17.030> betting<00:04:17.330> on<00:04:18.190> stocks<00:04:19.190> going

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
so I wouldn't be betting on stocks going

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.640 
so I wouldn't be betting on stocks going
up<00:04:19.760> or<00:04:19.940> things<00:04:20.120> going<00:04:20.480> up<00:04:20.630> because<00:04:21.470> I'm

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
up or things going up because I'm

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.230 
up or things going up because I'm
actually<00:04:22.130> betting<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.850> dollar<00:04:23.120> will

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
actually betting that the dollar will

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.390 
actually betting that the dollar will
keep<00:04:23.600> coming<00:04:23.990> down<00:04:24.200> so<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:24.890> definitely<00:04:25.010> don't

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
keep coming down so you definitely don't

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.830 
keep coming down so you definitely don't
think<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.670> consumer<00:04:26.180> is<00:04:26.330> going<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.540> be<00:04:26.630> making

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
think the consumer is going to be making

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.130 
think the consumer is going to be making

long<00:05:41.690> as<00:05:41.750> Obama<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.280> Federal<00:05:43.580> Reserve

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
long as Obama and the Federal Reserve

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.210 
long as Obama and the Federal Reserve
and<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.419> bank's<00:05:44.900> think<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.440> China<00:05:45.800> and

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
and the bank's think that China and

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.700 
and the bank's think that China and
Japan<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:46.669> England<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.900> Russia<00:05:48.110> will<00:05:48.470> keep

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
Japan and England and Russia will keep

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.520 
Japan and England and Russia will keep
accepting<00:05:49.070> our<00:05:49.340> dollars<00:05:49.760> we'll<00:05:50.360> be<00:05:50.510> fine<00:05:50.840> but

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
accepting our dollars we'll be fine but

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.180 
accepting our dollars we'll be fine but
already<00:05:51.979> I<00:05:52.840> suspect<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:54.530> China<00:05:54.860> Russia

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
already I suspect that China Russia

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.029 
already I suspect that China Russia
India<00:05:55.490> Brazil<00:05:56.419> are<00:05:57.080> not<00:05:57.289> going<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.560> accept<00:05:57.830> the

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
India Brazil are not going to accept the

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.980 
India Brazil are not going to accept the
dollar<00:05:58.280> anymore<00:05:58.700> because<00:05:58.850> they're<00:05:59.270> losing<00:05:59.660> so

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
dollar anymore because they're losing so

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.230 
dollar anymore because they're losing so
much<00:06:00.169> money<00:06:00.250> simply<00:06:01.250> because<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.940> Federal

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
much money simply because the Federal

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.690 
much money simply because the Federal
Reserve<00:06:02.570> is<00:06:02.810> printing<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.590> much<00:06:03.860> money<00:06:04.100> ie

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
Reserve is printing so much money ie

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.430 
Reserve is printing so much money ie
quantitative<00:06:05.510> easing<00:06:05.690> so<00:06:06.050> they're<00:06:06.229> saying

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
quantitative easing so they're saying

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.120
