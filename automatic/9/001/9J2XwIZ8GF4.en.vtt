00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.460

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
 I am 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.960
 Y 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:34.010
 hello hello guys welcome back a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.010
 new game mode but the rhythm 13 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010
 called 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.160
 of confirming the lakers and gentlemen you see 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.620
 has not seen in many tutorials so 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.620
 I wanted a video because 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.610
 basically 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.820
 but this game is about what 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.000
 once there is obviously play 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.610
 many player plus one is a guy 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.710
 in your friends with like a super guy 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.830
 soldiers or normal soldiers 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 they have to find you same way to follow 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.170
 that mind they can see themselves as a 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.680
 machine they have in their hands 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.860
 correctly that they have a machine that 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.580
 by pressing right click 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 they activate a mini a vision where they can 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.170
 see yourself by 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.830
 I think they have seen it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.980
 8 seconds but that was the most 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.980
 they should and they told me 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 in the link you can always leave it 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 down in the description 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.600
 as always by means of aquarium 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.850
 that is to say the good first we are going to 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.510
 the game folder I already have who 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.510
 my obligation 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.700
 once being in the folder 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.700
 we would have 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.790
 A) Yes 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.860
 benitez 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.800
 we would see other material inside are 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.020
 same 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.330
 well we're going to the claw folder and 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.020
 Simon 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.550
 this folder is not this folder this 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.350
 This folder is folder and there are many 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.710
 we process pressure to the sea from where 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.000
 sent to that folder or I do not know that 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.040
 he told me this shit came with the game 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.880
 I got there extra and this shit came out 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.880
 all this game 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.959
 lips 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.260
 we generated the station let's say we passed 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.260
 directly to move make rhythms 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.530
 you want to combine in the folder and in doing 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.530
 this with the five elements found 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.730
 and we hope it happens 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 have the wall was obviously because 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.120
 I have it 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.940
 and now 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.880
 we passed we changed the name 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.640
 it does not help 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.970
 the name and the direct 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.970
 without any compilation without any co 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.510
 giant fat operative system with the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.230
 supersonic computers to install 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.230
 a fucking shit 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.780
 noticing shit but until I've 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.990
 angry 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.540
 well that would be all I'm going to 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.709
 count for now the series 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.569
 It would be a series of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.169
 there are things I could say in this 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.169
 worse time 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.310
 I could not 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:33.250
 and everything for now I think it's a video 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.689
 so I 'm not 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.270
 if we do not want in the next 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.370
 for metals 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.910
 please do not come to claim me with the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.020
 fortune folder
