00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 with fairies and gentlemen and welcome to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.920
 conso jazz channel after the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.810
 ad for u2 and lukas for super smash 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 bros 4 we have another little surprise 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.820
 prepared by nintendo that comes in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.530
 way of being able to choose us which one is going to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.360
 be the next fighter to come in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.020
 clc form just like these two 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 last to our consoles this is a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.650
 great responsibility so I hope that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.090
 the tomÃ©is leave you down the link to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 You can vote for your character 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960
 favorite and I'll give you a list in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.400
 true small list of five characters 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 that I think would fit perfectly 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the world of smash bros either by the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.590
 ease of transferring attacks and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.880
 all that or good because they are mythical there 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.720
 we go 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.720
 I had 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.770
 in position number 5 we have maxwell 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.750
 protagonist of scribblenauts which 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.340
 can make anything appear and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.290
 when I say anything is any 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.000
 thing thanks to its non- magical power with 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.340
 just writing on it is a kind 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.040
 of naked but the cool goes all the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.690
 colorines and candies and many say no 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.580
 but how are you going to put this 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.170
 in smash and if it looks like it has nothing 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.510
 Well the same thing I take out a rocket launcher 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.700
 that brings you some boxing gloves that you 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.460
 pull out a fucking rex that pulls a gun 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.220
 geddon a nuclear bomb or what they 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.270
 leave notebook notebook 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.270
 day to day 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.780
 in the fourth place we have counsel the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.550
 kingdom hearts and as an option that is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.340
 has occurred 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.990
 the alternative costume to ricky both 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.450
 they could use the keyblade in their 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.710
 multiple with voice blows and so on 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.120
 et cetera etcetera and attacks 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 Officials could be, for example, 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.480
 hits dark electro shot no that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.730
 then yes it would be very restless but 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.740
 that very girl crystals would be a great 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.890
 membership of the smash brothers 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.800
 because it does not fit at all and be about 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.630
 sticks write me in everything perfectly 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.350
 and his final smash could be something like that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.440
 as of a transformation in shadow 2 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 in shadow or in some synchrotron or that 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.820
 appear roxas or go you know has 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.540
 many options and I think it should be 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.540
 can take advantage 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.860
 in position number 3 we have to finish 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.120
 right our dear lawyer very 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.820
 recognized in the world of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.310
 videogames great saga and you will ask 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.430
 how can you consider a lawyer who 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.010
 he has never fought while he has fought 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.940
 for this good game we would say the same 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.900
 of age hand for example and I think that a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.150
 marvel versus capcom has already had to 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.010
 go through the motto cbi the memories 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.110
 are in his game and he deals like a 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.320
 bastard his final smash would be like him 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.540
 how this one you have would be a judgment in 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.060
 plan to the beast in the game to go 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.580
 distributing more eye any the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.960
 I would really enjoy to see you the smash 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.960
 Bros shaking hands with others 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.970
 in the second place one of the 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.069
 most recognized characters in the world 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.819
 of videogames by their multiple 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.159
 adventures in two of raimat 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.040
 if that's guys rayman also has 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.930
 option to participate in smash bros if 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.819
 you vote enough for him there was already a 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.260
 fake that was created from what rayman was going to 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.019
 be in Strasbourg very well done by 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.879
 true but but this time it's going seriously 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.590
 can vote for the king van would be a 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.390
 great adhesion especially because it has the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.700
 mind the 2d mechanics adapted 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.040
 perfectly you can pass them more very 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.440
 easy the propeller for jumps the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.079
 special up the cuffs there are thousand 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.269
 ways to introduce combos 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.030
 etcetera etcetera etcetera besides 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.859
 it could use suits or cans 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.680
 these that gave him powers of others 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.799
 games that you have and could deposit 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.079
 pretty pretty cool that is to 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.299
 final smash then I would consider some 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.450
 invasion of dark loops or some 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.530
 little thing about these why because nm nnnn 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.530
 Men has potential 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.110
 number one on this list to which 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.270
 my vote has gone and come from the saga 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.040
 golden sun one of the best sagas of 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.290
 rpg is from history 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600
 james the protagonist of the little noise the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.020
 earth element that could make a 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.520
 great reappearance in smash bros brawl was 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.440
 an assistant and who this one could do 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.060
 become part of the wrestling squad 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160
 just like he did wrong that was also 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.870
 helper in smart for fraud and here already 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.420

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.070
 magnificent fighter as hans could be 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.020
 the same with your energy has 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.300
 many options when choosing 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.300
 to attack carries his sword so that 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.260
 with everyone that's more final 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.840
 it could be some combination of jeans or 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.970
 the same final judgment if I stay with a 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.250
 final judgment because like it sounds good 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.100
 final judgment fuck like that 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.830
