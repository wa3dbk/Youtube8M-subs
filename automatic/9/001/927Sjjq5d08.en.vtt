00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

in<00:00:00.120> this<00:00:00.930> video<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.260> want<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> talk<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:01.709> the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
in this video I want to talk about the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this video I want to talk about the
quarry<00:00:02.129> cycle<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.240> quarry<00:00:03.480> cycle<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.080> an

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
quarry cycle the quarry cycle is an

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.789 
quarry cycle the quarry cycle is an
example<00:00:05.310> actually<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.670> substrate<00:00:06.240> cycling

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
example actually of substrate cycling

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.790 
example actually of substrate cycling
which<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.950> just<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> idea<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.700> we<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.599> have

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
which is just the idea that we can have

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.530 
which is just the idea that we can have
two<00:00:10.800> different<00:00:10.830> reverse<00:00:11.670> processes

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
two different reverse processes

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.810 
two different reverse processes
occurring<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.110> same<00:00:13.259> time<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.670> this

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
occurring at the same time but in this

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.650 
occurring at the same time but in this
case<00:00:15.000> we're<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> talk<00:00:15.540> about

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
case we're going to talk about

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
case we're going to talk about
glycolysis<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.470> gluconeogenesis<00:00:16.710> occurring

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurring

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.540 
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurring
at<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.730> same<00:00:17.880> time<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.630> recall<00:00:18.960> before<00:00:19.740> we

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
at the same time if you recall before we

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
at the same time if you recall before we
mentioned<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.119> can't<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.570> Baikal

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
mentioned that you can't have Baikal

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
mentioned that you can't have Baikal
assist<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.350> gluconeogenesis<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.519> in

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
assist and gluconeogenesis going on in

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
assist and gluconeogenesis going on in
the<00:00:24.029> same<00:00:24.240> cell<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.019> same<00:00:25.230> time<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the same cell at the same time that

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.230 
the same cell at the same time that
would<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.340> make<00:00:26.430> sense<00:00:26.490> why<00:00:26.880> would<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> want

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
would it make sense why would you want

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.150 
would it make sense why would you want
to<00:00:27.300> break<00:00:27.510> down<00:00:27.750> glucose<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.439> make<00:00:28.740> glucose

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
to break down glucose and make glucose

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.400 
to break down glucose and make glucose
at<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> same<00:00:29.760> time<00:00:30.000> doesn't<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:30.929> sense

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
at the same time doesn't make sense

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990 
at the same time doesn't make sense
so<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.309> both<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> these

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
so then how would both of these

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
so then how would both of these
processes<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:34.020> occurring<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> same<00:00:34.680> time

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
processes be occurring at the same time

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
processes be occurring at the same time
how<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.579> possible<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.960> would<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.140> do

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
how is this possible what would we do

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.350 
how is this possible what would we do
they<00:00:37.800> both<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.340> happening<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.059> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
they both be happening but just in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.060 
they both be happening but just in
different<00:00:39.840> cells<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> example<00:00:46.260> follows

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
different cells so the example follows

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.569 
different cells so the example follows
with<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.610> particular<00:00:48.170> human<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.350> having<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
with if a particular human is having you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.150 
with if a particular human is having you
know<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:51.020> workout<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:52.620> sort<00:00:52.860> they're

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
know a workout of some sort they're

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
know a workout of some sort they're
exercising<00:00:53.969> anaerobically<00:00:54.840> without<00:00:55.199> oxygen

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
exercising anaerobically without oxygen

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.880 
exercising anaerobically without oxygen
okay<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.910> they're<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.270> their<00:00:58.230> muscle<00:00:58.710> cells

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
okay so they're gonna their muscle cells

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.990 
okay so they're gonna their muscle cells
they're<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.340> working<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.789> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
they're going to be working them and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400 
they're going to be working them and
their<00:01:00.420> muscles<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.230> doing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
their muscles are going to be doing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.130 
their muscles are going to be doing
undergoing<00:01:01.890> glycolysis<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.329> glycolysis<00:01:03.870> will

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
undergoing glycolysis so glycolysis will

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.580 
undergoing glycolysis so glycolysis will
be<00:01:04.260> occurring<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.890> their<00:01:05.220> muscles<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.590> will

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
be occurring in their muscles and will

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.070 
be occurring in their muscles and will
be<00:01:07.680> converting<00:01:08.159> glucose<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:09.330> pyruvate<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
be converting glucose into pyruvate and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.130 
be converting glucose into pyruvate and
they'll<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.170> making<00:01:13.350> ATP<00:01:13.770> anaerobically

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
they'll be making ATP anaerobically

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.980 
they'll be making ATP anaerobically
now<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.950> happens<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:18.450> order<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now when that happens in order to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.300 
now when that happens in order to
continue<00:01:19.500> glycolysis<00:01:20.000> we<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:22.310> particular

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
continue glycolysis we need a particular

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850 
continue glycolysis we need a particular
process<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> occur<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.830> can

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
process to occur and so that we can

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.670 
process to occur and so that we can
regenerate<00:01:26.570> NAD+<00:01:27.570> --is<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.590> have

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
regenerate NAD+ --is because if we have

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.630 
regenerate NAD+ --is because if we have
a<00:01:28.770> buildup<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.250> nadh<00:01:29.820> --is<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.990> need<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> re

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
a buildup of nadh --is we need to re

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630 
a buildup of nadh --is we need to re
oxidize<00:01:33.350> those<00:01:34.350> NADH<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.189> contain<00:01:35.490> they

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
oxidize those NADH is back contain they

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.120 
oxidize those NADH is back contain they
put<00:01:35.850> nad<00:01:36.270> plus<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.979> them

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
put nad plus so that we can have them

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.590 
put nad plus so that we can have them
available<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.549> glycolysis<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.479> they

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
available for glycolysis because they

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
available for glycolysis because they
are<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> physical<00:01:39.990> requirement<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.829> what

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
are a physical requirement of what

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
are a physical requirement of what
causes<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.970> process<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.420> called

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
causes and that process is called

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.550 
causes and that process is called
fermentation<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.930> hopefully<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.380> all

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
fermentation and this hopefully is all

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.880 
fermentation and this hopefully is all
review<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:49.200> undergoing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
review so if we're undergoing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
review so if we're undergoing
fermentation<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.000> regenerate<00:01:51.479> NAD+<00:01:51.869> is's<00:01:52.229> if

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
fermentation to regenerate NAD+ is's if

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.050 
fermentation to regenerate NAD+ is's if
you<00:01:52.890> recall<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.950> lactate<00:01:56.460> fermentation

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you recall that was lactate fermentation

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.800 
you recall that was lactate fermentation
so<00:01:57.180> pyruvate<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.750> turned<00:01:58.020> into<00:01:58.200> lactate<00:01:59.810> so

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so pyruvate was turned into lactate so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.280 
so pyruvate was turned into lactate so
as<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.140> regenerate<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.979> ID<00:02:02.399> pluses<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
as to regenerate and ID pluses from the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.059 
as to regenerate and ID pluses from the
NADH<00:02:05.159> s<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.610> formed<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.920> lactate<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
NADH s that are formed so lactate is a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.110 
NADH s that are formed so lactate is a

about that go ahead and Google like
lactic<00:02:22.140> acid<00:02:22.470> poisoning<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.930> don't

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
lactic acid poisoning if you don't

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.030 
lactic acid poisoning if you don't
already<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:27.470> there's<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.560> organ<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.950> our

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
already know there's an organ in our

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
already know there's an organ in our
body<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.580> involved<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.090> detoxifying

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
body that is involved in detoxifying

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.780 
body that is involved in detoxifying
poisons<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.800> organ<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.220> liver

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
poisons and that organ is the liver

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.620 
poisons and that organ is the liver
so<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:34.050> lactate<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:36.170> taken<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.320> liver<00:02:38.630> to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
so this lactate is taken to the liver to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.650 
so this lactate is taken to the liver to
be<00:02:39.660> reoxidized<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.760> pyruvate<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:44.390> then<00:02:45.390> once

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
be reoxidized to pyruvate and then once

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.110 
be reoxidized to pyruvate and then once
we<00:02:45.780> have<00:02:46.020> these<00:02:46.200> pyruvates<00:02:47.120> gluconeogenesis

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
we have these pyruvates gluconeogenesis

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.430 
we have these pyruvates gluconeogenesis
occurs<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:50.010> make<00:02:50.220> glucose<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.739> liver<00:02:53.209> so

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
occurs to make glucose in the liver so

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.050 
occurs to make glucose in the liver so
this<00:02:55.440> glucose<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.459> go<00:02:56.580> back<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
this glucose then can go back to the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.390 
this glucose then can go back to the
muscle<00:02:57.360> cells<00:02:57.570> for<00:02:57.959> glycolysis<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:59.100> what's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
muscle cells for glycolysis so what's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.310 
muscle cells for glycolysis so what's
going<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.790> here<00:03:00.150> we're<00:03:00.600> having<00:03:00.870> glycolysis

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
going on here we're having glycolysis

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.140 
going on here we're having glycolysis
occurring<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.190> muscles<00:03:02.580> while

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
occurring in the muscles while

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150 
occurring in the muscles while
gluconeogenesis<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:04.170> occurring<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
gluconeogenesis is occurring in the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.250 
gluconeogenesis is occurring in the
liver<00:03:05.390> they're<00:03:06.390> both<00:03:06.540> happening<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.110> same

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
liver they're both happening at the same

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.470 
liver they're both happening at the same
time<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:08.190> get<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> visual<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.330> little

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
time to get a visual on this little

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.979 
time to get a visual on this little
diagram<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:14.010> we<00:03:14.340> imagine<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.790> guy<00:03:15.000> this

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
diagram here if we imagine this guy this

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.090 
diagram here if we imagine this guy this
is<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> really<00:03:16.410> buff<00:03:16.590> dude<00:03:16.830> okay<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.739> he<00:03:19.739> went

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
is a really buff dude okay and he went

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.680 
is a really buff dude okay and he went
through<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.730> gym<00:03:20.940> because<00:03:21.269> he<00:03:21.420> wanted<00:03:21.630> to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
through to the gym because he wanted to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.330 
through to the gym because he wanted to
get<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> good<00:03:22.170> arm<00:03:22.380> workout<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.980> he<00:03:23.070> wanted<00:03:23.250> to

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
get a good arm workout so he wanted to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.759 
get a good arm workout so he wanted to
work<00:03:23.459> his<00:03:23.610> biceps<00:03:24.030> which<00:03:24.660> i<00:03:24.870> brilliantly

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
work his biceps which i brilliantly

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.449 
work his biceps which i brilliantly
drawn<00:03:26.040> here<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> I've<00:03:28.410> labeled<00:03:28.620> his<00:03:29.040> muscles

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
drawn here so I've labeled his muscles

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.509 
drawn here so I've labeled his muscles
his<00:03:29.519> bicep<00:03:29.910> muscle<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:31.370> noted<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.489> red

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
his bicep muscle here and noted in red

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.479 
his bicep muscle here and noted in red
and<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.180> purple<00:03:33.510> thing<00:03:33.690> here<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:33.959> his<00:03:34.110> liver

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
and this purple thing here is his liver

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.509 
and this purple thing here is his liver
so<00:03:35.489> he's<00:03:36.480> gonna<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.860> doing<00:03:37.860> some<00:03:38.160> bicep<00:03:38.340> curls

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
so he's gonna be doing some bicep curls

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.220 
so he's gonna be doing some bicep curls
and<00:03:39.030> that's<00:03:39.269> going<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.600> eat<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:39.989> gonna<00:03:40.079> be<00:03:40.170> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and that's going to eat it's gonna be a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.100 
and that's going to eat it's gonna be a
quick<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.739> vigorous<00:03:41.250> workout<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:42.989> he's

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
quick and vigorous workout and when he's

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.410 
quick and vigorous workout and when he's
doing<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.590> these<00:03:44.579> muscle<00:03:44.910> cells<00:03:44.940> are<00:03:45.299> going

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
doing this these muscle cells are going

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.620 
doing this these muscle cells are going
to<00:03:45.480> need<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:46.190> be<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.670> going<00:03:47.910> through<00:03:48.030> by<00:03:48.180> kalus

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
to need to be be going through by kalus

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.319 
to need to be be going through by kalus
so<00:03:49.290> what's<00:03:49.739> going<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.920> happen<00:03:50.010> they<00:03:50.910> mean

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
so what's going to happen they mean

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.819 
so what's going to happen they mean
these<00:03:51.510> muscle<00:03:51.750> cells<00:03:51.900> need<00:03:52.079> ATP<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:52.680> that's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
these muscle cells need ATP so that's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.750 
these muscle cells need ATP so that's
what<00:03:53.010> they're<00:03:53.130> going<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.489> they're<00:03:53.640> going

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
what they're going to do they're going

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.000 
what they're going to do they're going
to<00:03:53.850> undergo<00:03:54.060> glycolysis<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:55.440> with<00:03:55.590> glycolysis

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
to undergo glycolysis so with glycolysis

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.080 
to undergo glycolysis so with glycolysis
occurs<00:03:56.160> they're<00:03:56.640> going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.820> have<00:03:56.940> their

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
occurs they're going to have their

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.180 
occurs they're going to have their
glucose<00:03:57.540> right<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.200> they're<00:03:58.890> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.070> turn

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
glucose right and they're going to turn

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.470 
glucose right and they're going to turn
it<00:03:59.370> into<00:03:59.489> pyruvate<00:03:59.910> and<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.090> course<00:04:00.299> make

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it into pyruvate and of course make

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.780 
it into pyruvate and of course make
those<00:04:00.600> a-gps<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.950> once<00:04:02.100> we<00:04:02.340> have<00:04:02.489> this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
those a-gps but once we have this

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.490 
those a-gps but once we have this
pyruvate<00:04:03.060> because<00:04:03.840> there's<00:04:04.019> no<00:04:04.140> oxygen

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
pyruvate because there's no oxygen

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.920 
pyruvate because there's no oxygen
around<00:04:04.739> we<00:04:05.549> can't<00:04:05.850> go<00:04:06.209> through<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.510> TCA<00:04:06.840> cycle

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
around we can't go through the TCA cycle

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.509 
around we can't go through the TCA cycle
which<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.470> haven't<00:04:07.650> made<00:04:07.829> videos<00:04:07.890> on<00:04:08.310> they're

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
which I haven't made videos on they're

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.150 
which I haven't made videos on they're
actually<00:04:08.790> coming<00:04:08.910> up<00:04:09.120> next<00:04:09.859> but<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:10.980> pyruvate

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.180 
actually coming up next but the pyruvate
once<00:04:11.910> it's<00:04:12.090> around<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.480> needs<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.750> be

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
once it's around it needs to be

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.470 
once it's around it needs to be
converted<00:04:14.190> into<00:04:14.489> lactate<00:04:15.000> right<00:04:15.269> through

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
converted into lactate right through

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.810 
converted into lactate right through
fermentation<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.859> as<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.160> regenerate<00:04:17.729> these

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
fermentation so as to regenerate these

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.960 
fermentation so as to regenerate these
NAD+<00:04:18.390> --is<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.350> then<00:04:19.530> like<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.489> said<00:04:20.549> this

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
NAD+ --is but then like I said this

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.930 
NAD+ --is but then like I said this
lactate<00:04:21.539> is<00:04:21.720> toxic<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.950> our<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.340> our<00:04:23.400> cells<00:04:23.700> so

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
lactate is toxic to our to our cells so

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.810 
lactate is toxic to our to our cells so
our<00:04:24.210> body<00:04:24.900> takes<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.919> lactate<00:04:26.370> from<00:04:26.700> our

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
our body takes that lactate from our

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.740 
our body takes that lactate from our
muscle<00:04:27.150> cells<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.479> this

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
muscle cells so this

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.090 
muscle cells so this
this<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.410> all<00:04:28.530> happening<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:29.040> the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
this this is all happening in the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.840 
this this is all happening in the
muscles<00:04:29.460> okay<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.330> process<00:04:30.750> here<00:04:31.020> actually

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
muscles okay this process here actually

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.220 
muscles okay this process here actually
boxed<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:32.940> in<00:04:33.060> red<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.960> can<00:04:34.110> know

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
boxed it in red so that you can know

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.440 
boxed it in red so that you can know
that<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.500> occurring<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.520> muscles<00:04:35.850> this

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
that is occurring in the muscles this

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.480 
that is occurring in the muscles this
lactate<00:04:36.960> right<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.740> going<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.920> go<00:04:37.980> through<00:04:38.340> our

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
lactate right is going to go through our

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.170 
lactate right is going to go through our
blood<00:04:38.760> okay<00:04:39.630> all<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:41.190> way<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.340> our<00:04:41.490> liver<00:04:41.700> okay

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
blood okay all the way to our liver okay

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.150 
blood okay all the way to our liver okay
so<00:04:42.240> there's<00:04:42.630> no<00:04:42.720> black<00:04:43.650> T<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.890> going<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.100> go

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
so there's no black T is going to go

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.280 
so there's no black T is going to go
from<00:04:44.340> here<00:04:44.370> from<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.730> muscles<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.960> our<00:04:46.080> liver

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
from here from the muscles to our liver

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.350 
from here from the muscles to our liver
via<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.340> blood<00:04:47.520> circulation

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
via the blood circulation

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.770 
via the blood circulation
now<00:04:49.080> when<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.920> lactate<00:04:50.460> get<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.540> liver

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
now when that lactate get to the liver

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.740 
now when that lactate get to the liver
it's<00:04:52.110> going<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.620> turned<00:04:52.830> back<00:04:53.070> into<00:04:53.750> a

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
it's going to be turned back into a

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.590 
it's going to be turned back into a
pyruvate<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:58.740> pyruvate<00:04:58.950> will<00:04:59.520> you<00:05:00.000> for

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
pyruvate and that pyruvate will you for

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240 
pyruvate and that pyruvate will you for
every<00:05:00.780> two<00:05:00.930> pyruvate<00:05:01.320> they<00:05:01.440> are<00:05:01.530> you're<00:05:02.130> going

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
every two pyruvate they are you're going

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.280 
every two pyruvate they are you're going
to<00:05:02.310> take<00:05:02.910> those<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.210> turn<00:05:03.570> them<00:05:03.750> back<00:05:04.020> into

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
to take those and turn them back into

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.530 
to take those and turn them back into
glucose<00:05:04.980> now<00:05:05.730> once<00:05:05.970> you've<00:05:06.120> created<00:05:06.300> that

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
glucose now once you've created that

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.060 
glucose now once you've created that
glucose<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.080> liver<00:05:07.290> can<00:05:07.470> then<00:05:07.620> dump<00:05:07.890> that

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
glucose the liver can then dump that

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.400 
glucose the liver can then dump that
into<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.910> blood<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.780> blood<00:05:09.990> can<00:05:10.200> carry

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
into the blood and the blood can carry

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.980 
into the blood and the blood can carry
that<00:05:10.560> glucose<00:05:10.890> back<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.690> muscle<00:05:12.690> cell<00:05:12.870> and

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
that glucose back to the muscle cell and

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.140 
that glucose back to the muscle cell and
the<00:05:13.320> muscle<00:05:13.560> cell<00:05:13.740> can<00:05:13.919> can<00:05:14.280> have<00:05:14.490> another

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
the muscle cell can can have another

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.030 
the muscle cell can can have another
glucose<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:15.960> break<00:05:16.140> down<00:05:16.290> that's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
glucose that it can break down that's

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.580 
glucose that it can break down that's
basically<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.580> Cori<00:05:17.760> cycle<00:05:18.320> hope<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.470> was

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
basically the Cori cycle hope that was

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.450 
basically the Cori cycle hope that was
helpful<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.130> thank<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:20.940> for<00:05:21.150> watching
