00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.480
 martial arts in general i am integrated 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.610
 let's say the glimpses of martial arts 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.800
 fights serious without a fight I can not do 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.200
 I will not show you the amplitude 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.899
 simple serious so where required 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.509
 good technical physics and well this 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.670
 such things 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:39.370
 It turns out over the years they are very difficult 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 and for the ordinary person in ordinary life 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:48.070
 always well let's say it always works 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.620
 need we consider the most basic 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.090
 principles the most highlights like not 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.250
 get caught on throws and how to perform 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:06.920
 elementary very effective throws 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:08.509
 let's start the racks let's say 2 say 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.280
 like a prince on the first principle 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.899
 how to grab and throw date 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.509
 if you allow the field with such 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.950
 situations that you need to wear beats here 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.350
 what you need to do to grab and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.259
 quit i just daddy want it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.080
 grab naturally my opponent is not 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:35.600
 give drove 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.220
 what start i do he will defend himself for 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.259
 consumed and it will be very difficult for me 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:46.220
 unbalance him there and 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:51.549
 perform a throw or make and therefore 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.759
 need to do this to quit and 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.299
 fulfilled 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:01.420
 bring out early and that means the first is badgers 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.420
 perform as final there is 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:14.090
 passed into the head and piled 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.120
 this movement is the movement for the last 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.070
 movements took fashion and dumped it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.160
 it turns out it seems to me the final 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.160
 act 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:30.230
 i make a throw or grab look 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.150
 on things like meetings on actions means 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.000
 in this case, let's say 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.970
 about you about the money we have on the mountain 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.920
 feet i take and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:47.690
 volume 1 option 2 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:50.330
 here I hit my head that is 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.220
 it turns out such a principle 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.739
 two principles that is, as the final 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.600
 Odessans and as a counterattack test 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.750
 just let's stand with you head 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.760
 run to grab and then asks for it 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.110
 look stupid but there are such situations 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.880
 just said grabbed there by the hand up 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.340
 the soul there somehow turned out ready already 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.470
 other corpses different situation and another 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.720
 mode but these things will not be considered 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.150
 because there are many such situations 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.030
 they are very standards and so i would like 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.580
 so that you look at it a little bit 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:36.850
 what was happening mickey and how how 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.850
 drains can be done and smolin 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:56.630
 committing as it just performs 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 hands to the end then I performed and I found 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.640
 I need to finish 1 room that I 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:08.650
 made 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.650
 March, lower it as it can be done 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:28.550
 next he can do i do like 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.830
 whatever he does ahead is even better strongly 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.650
 i want scary i mean i sit on 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.729
 knees in front of the leg 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:43.210
 I press my knee 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.210
 hands take away new about how rubber closer 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:05:01.729
 I bring out I interpret by doing I push very much 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.710
 quick to do so that people do not 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.710
 expected there and then such such 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.520
 prepared before it can cover but 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.630
 when you learn to do it very much 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.139
 slowly and calmly 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.130
 once again racks performing some 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.640
 any action 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:28.640
 I fold it can it 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.640
 to shoulder 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:06:05.990
 he lacks strength element 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.990
 surprises 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:19.220
 receive in the same way you will 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.220
 come in 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:40.430
 complete repels new days for both 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.430
 legs we enter the curtain still 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:58.890
 eaten on top and controls still ebbs 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:59.430
 sat down and if you wish you have enough 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.700
 forces 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.380
 is it possible to slightly raise 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.410
 How does this happen 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:14.040
 everyone got hooked on the boat can dump it 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:17.760
 already so questions to receive but it requires 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.030
 a little light some kind of 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.510
 training there working out so on here 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.430
 if we say you worked 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.470
 battle or some situation it happened 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.920
 what can you afford to raise and 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:35.010
 stick please can do this 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:38.060
 Here are the main let's say under the methods to have 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.060
 I will fall down other options
