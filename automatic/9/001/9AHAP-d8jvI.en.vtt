6:1 this season plus they're in superb
scoring<00:00:44.600> form<00:00:44.900> and<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:45.440> should<00:00:45.650> be<00:00:45.770> quite

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
scoring form and this should be quite

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.260 
scoring form and this should be quite
straightforward<00:00:46.730> for<00:00:46.880> Real<00:00:47.000> Madrid

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
straightforward for Real Madrid

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.360 
straightforward for Real Madrid
theoretically<00:00:47.900> at<00:00:48.080> least<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:48.380> should<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.739> I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
theoretically at least it should be I

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.549 
theoretically at least it should be I
think<00:00:50.000> there's<00:00:50.150> a<00:00:50.210> slight<00:00:50.450> doubt<00:00:51.020> or<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.320> slight

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
think there's a slight doubt or a slight

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.229 
think there's a slight doubt or a slight
risk<00:00:51.800> isn't<00:00:52.100> there<00:00:52.309> which<00:00:52.430> is<00:00:52.580> that<00:00:52.760> sometimes

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
risk isn't there which is that sometimes

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.850 
risk isn't there which is that sometimes
when<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.629> go<00:00:53.750> into<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> game<00:00:54.199> in<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.440> situation

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
when you go into a game in a situation

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.410 
when you go into a game in a situation
like<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:55.129> in<00:00:55.339> which<00:00:55.370> you're<00:00:55.940> scoring<00:00:56.239> lots

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
like this in which you're scoring lots

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.549 
like this in which you're scoring lots
of<00:00:56.540> goals<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.900> Madrid's<00:00:57.199> goal<00:00:57.350> scoring

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
of goals and Madrid's goal scoring

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.810 
of goals and Madrid's goal scoring
record<00:00:57.830> over<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.010> last<00:00:58.160> six<00:00:58.430> or<00:00:58.519> seven<00:00:58.730> games

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
record over the last six or seven games

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.579 
record over the last six or seven games
has<00:00:59.000> been<00:00:59.180> extraordinary<00:00:59.540> when<00:01:00.379> you're<00:01:00.500> up

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
has been extraordinary when you're up

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:01.450 
has been extraordinary when you're up
against<00:01:00.830> a<00:01:00.920> team<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.190> you've<00:01:01.309> already

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
against a team that you've already

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.400 
against a team that you've already
scored<00:01:01.879> six<00:01:02.120> against<00:01:02.449> away<00:01:02.809> from<00:01:03.050> home<00:01:03.230> and

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
scored six against away from home and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.680 
scored six against away from home and
then<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:03.769> come<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.309> play<00:01:04.460> them<00:01:04.640> at<00:01:04.760> home<00:01:04.970> but

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
then you come to play them at home but

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.210 
then you come to play them at home but
the<00:01:05.990> risk<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.470> way<00:01:06.620> is<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.950> everybody

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the risk in a way is that everybody

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.520 
the risk in a way is that everybody
expects<00:01:07.820> it<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.540> rather<00:01:08.780> than<00:01:09.050> rather<00:01:09.409> than

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
expects it but rather than rather than

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.050 
expects it but rather than rather than
being<00:01:09.710> an<00:01:09.800> opportunity<00:01:10.310> gets<00:01:10.550> almost<00:01:10.850> seen<00:01:11.030> as

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
being an opportunity gets almost seen as

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.940 
being an opportunity gets almost seen as
an<00:01:11.240> obligation<00:01:11.360> but<00:01:12.230> I<00:01:12.320> think<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
an obligation but I think that the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.230 
an obligation but I think that the
bottom<00:01:13.130> line<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.520> Brown<00:01:13.760> Ridge<00:01:13.940> should

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
bottom line is that Brown Ridge should

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.780 
bottom line is that Brown Ridge should
win<00:01:14.420> relatively<00:01:15.110> comfortably<00:01:15.500> no<00:01:16.220> Cristiano

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
win relatively comfortably no Cristiano

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.550 
win relatively comfortably no Cristiano

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
Ronaldo of course he's been ruled out of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.070 
Ronaldo of course he's been ruled out of
the<00:01:18.650> game<00:01:19.340> with<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:19.700> small<00:01:20.120> knock<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:20.990> he

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
the game with that small knock that he

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.210 
the game with that small knock that he

said he wouldn't be able to play this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.910 
said he wouldn't be able to play this

weekend and mints were viola Leith that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.710 
weekend and mints were viola Leith that
I<00:01:30.740> suppose<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.760> doubt<00:01:31.940> would<00:01:32.120> be<00:01:32.300> that<00:01:32.540> then

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
I suppose the doubt would be that then

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.060 
I suppose the doubt would be that then
after<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.350> following<00:01:33.590> weekend<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.040> a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
after that the following weekend is a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.140 
after that the following weekend is a
couple<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.520> game<00:01:34.730> for<00:01:34.760> which<00:01:34.970> he's

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
couple of a game for which he's

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.760 
couple of a game for which he's
suspended<00:01:35.660> so<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:36.080> could<00:01:36.290> be<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.470> there'd<00:01:36.680> be

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
suspended so it could be that there'd be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.830 
suspended so it could be that there'd be
a<00:01:36.800> temptation<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.610> say<00:01:38.000> right<00:01:38.240> take<00:01:38.540> two<00:01:38.720> weeks

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
a temptation to say right take two weeks

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.530 
a temptation to say right take two weeks
off<00:01:39.080> be<00:01:39.640> really<00:01:40.640> fired<00:01:40.910> up<00:01:41.090> when<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.360> come

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
off be really fired up when you come

off be really fired up when you come
back<00:01:41.720> we<00:01:41.930> really<00:01:42.230> ready<00:01:42.440> have<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.010> bit<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.250> a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
back we really ready have a bit of a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.370 
back we really ready have a bit of a
break<00:01:43.520> clear<00:01:43.790> your<00:01:43.970> mind<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.810> problem<00:01:45.260> with

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
break clear your mind the problem with

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.800 
break clear your mind the problem with
that<00:01:45.500> theory<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:47.030> suspect<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.480> person<00:01:47.630> who

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
that theory is I suspect the person who

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.510 
that theory is I suspect the person who
believes<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.230> at<00:01:48.320> least<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.680> Ronaldo<00:01:49.010> himself

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
believes in at least is Ronaldo himself

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.310 
believes in at least is Ronaldo himself
I<00:01:49.700> suspect<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.270> right<00:01:50.480> now<00:01:50.690> particularly

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
I suspect that right now particularly

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.180 
I suspect that right now particularly
because<00:01:51.410> he's<00:01:51.590> been<00:01:51.710> playing<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.160> well

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
because he's been playing so well

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.550 
because he's been playing so well
because<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:52.850> feels<00:01:53.300> like<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.630> momentum<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:54.350> is

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
because it feels like the momentum is is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.650 
because it feels like the momentum is is
unstoppable<00:01:55.040> at<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.490> moment<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.970> think<00:01:56.240> he

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
unstoppable at the moment I think he

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.480 
unstoppable at the moment I think he
will<00:01:56.840> be<00:01:56.870> genuinely<00:01:57.560> frustrated<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.340> miss

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
will be genuinely frustrated to miss

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.100 
will be genuinely frustrated to miss
this<00:01:58.640> game<00:01:58.820> even<00:01:59.150> if<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.510> is<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.690> Champions

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
this game even if it is a Champions

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.690 
this game even if it is a Champions
League<00:02:00.140> game<00:02:00.410> which<00:02:00.560> up<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> point

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
League game which up to a point

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.270 
League game which up to a point
is<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:02.150> not<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.630> big<00:02:02.870> big<00:02:03.440> danger<00:02:03.800> for<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.980> Madrid

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
is is not a big big danger for a Madrid

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.010 
is is not a big big danger for a Madrid
and<00:02:04.400> up<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.700> point<00:02:04.730> doesn't<00:02:05.210> feel<00:02:05.390> like<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and up to a point doesn't feel like it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.480 
and up to a point doesn't feel like it
matters<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.470> much<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:06.890> think<00:02:06.920> every<00:02:07.370> game

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
matters that much I think every game

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.949 
matters that much I think every game
matters<00:02:07.730> for<00:02:07.940> an<00:02:08.060> hour<00:02:08.179> though<00:02:08.300> because<00:02:08.840> he

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
matters for an hour though because he

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.869 
matters for an hour though because he
seems<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.349> on<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:09.590> just<00:02:10.250> incredible

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
seems to be on this just incredible

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.559 
seems to be on this just incredible
crusade<00:02:11.390> at<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.690> moment<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.430> think<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.090> I

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
crusade at the moment and I think that I

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.630 
crusade at the moment and I think that I
think<00:02:14.840> he'll<00:02:14.989> be<00:02:15.140> frustrated<00:02:15.590> with<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.769> but

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
think he'll be frustrated with it but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280 
think he'll be frustrated with it but
then<00:02:16.760> we'll<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.330> mean<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.599> he'll<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.080> fit

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
then we'll see I mean it he'll be fit

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.320 
then we'll see I mean it he'll be fit
perhaps<00:02:18.709> provide<00:02:19.129> lift<00:02:19.340> not<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.819> -<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.150> time

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
perhaps provide lift not in - it's time

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.690 
perhaps provide lift not in - it's time
it's<00:02:20.690> not<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> big<00:02:21.170> deal<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.920> expect<00:02:22.310> I'm

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
it's not a big deal you expect I'm

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
it's not a big deal you expect I'm
healthy<00:02:22.970> Maria<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.330> come<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.599> yeah<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.110> think<00:02:24.230> so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
healthy Maria to come in yeah I think so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.839 
healthy Maria to come in yeah I think so
I<00:02:24.590> know<00:02:24.769> there's<00:02:25.129> a<00:02:25.190> couple<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.489> options<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
I know there's a couple of options the

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.190 
I know there's a couple of options the
other<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.120> maybe<00:02:26.269> would<00:02:26.510> be<00:02:26.540> Jose<00:02:26.959> who<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
other one maybe would be Jose who I

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.390 
other one maybe would be Jose who I
thought<00:02:27.379> played<00:02:27.590> very<00:02:27.800> well<00:02:27.830> at<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.069> weekend

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
thought played very well at the weekend

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.949 
thought played very well at the weekend
against<00:02:28.730> al<00:02:28.849> meriya<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.480> person<00:02:29.810> he's<00:02:29.930> a

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
against al meriya and person he's a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.750 
against al meriya and person he's a
player<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.799> really<00:02:31.040> quite<00:02:31.219> like<00:02:31.280> he

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
player that that I really quite like he

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.090 
player that that I really quite like he
he<00:02:32.209> transmits<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.959> sense<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.290> confidence

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
he transmits that sense of confidence

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.210 
he transmits that sense of confidence
that's<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:35.030> real<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.440> real<00:02:36.620> conviction

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
that's a real kind of a real conviction

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.530 
that's a real kind of a real conviction
about<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> way<00:02:37.610> he<00:02:37.730> plays<00:02:37.970> he<00:02:38.150> takes<00:02:38.390> people

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
about the way he plays he takes people

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.600 
about the way he plays he takes people
on<00:02:38.870> he's<00:02:39.110> dynamic<00:02:39.350> he's<00:02:39.980> brave

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
on he's dynamic he's brave

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
on he's dynamic he's brave
but<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.300> think<00:02:41.360> our<00:02:41.570> Hilde<00:02:41.900> Maria<00:02:42.140> because<00:02:42.380> I

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
but I think our Hilde Maria because I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530 
but I think our Hilde Maria because I
think<00:02:42.530> Ancelotti<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.550> in<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.880> process<00:02:44.090> now

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
think Ancelotti is is in a process now

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.960 
think Ancelotti is is in a process now
ELISA<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.650> believe<00:02:46.070> he<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.520> process<00:02:46.700> now

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
ELISA I believe he is in a process now

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.280 
ELISA I believe he is in a process now
where<00:02:47.150> where<00:02:47.570> he's<00:02:47.660> looking<00:02:47.870> at<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.020> squadron

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
where where he's looking at a squadron

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.810 
where where he's looking at a squadron
he's<00:02:48.440> looking<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:48.770> how<00:02:48.860> he<00:02:48.920> manages<00:02:49.370> his<00:02:49.520> squad

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
he's looking at how he manages his squad

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.090 
he's looking at how he manages his squad
bow<00:02:50.360> physically<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.020> also<00:02:51.080> emotionally<00:02:51.350> and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
bow physically but also emotionally and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.800 
bow physically but also emotionally and
I<00:02:52.490> think<00:02:52.700> he<00:02:52.820> recognizes<00:02:53.240> that<00:02:53.390> right<00:02:53.630> these

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
I think he recognizes that right these

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.300 
I think he recognizes that right these
injuries<00:02:54.170> are<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.410> problem<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.070> they're<00:02:55.160> also

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
injuries are a problem but they're also

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.950 
injuries are a problem but they're also
an<00:02:55.490> opportunity<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.120> try<00:02:56.360> people<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.780> certain

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
an opportunity to try people in certain

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.200 
an opportunity to try people in certain
positions<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:58.070> see<00:02:58.310> how<00:02:58.490> well<00:02:58.670> they<00:02:58.820> slot<00:02:59.060> in

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
positions to see how well they slot in

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.810 
positions to see how well they slot in
and<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.660> make<00:02:59.840> sure<00:02:59.870> those<00:03:00.320> players<00:03:00.620> who<00:03:01.580> deep

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and to make sure those players who deep

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.580 
and to make sure those players who deep
down<00:03:01.850> know<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.630> when<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.350> when<00:03:03.500> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
down know that when you know when the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.200 
down know that when you know when the
big<00:03:03.710> game<00:03:03.950> comes<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.430> there's<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.610> starting<00:03:04.940> 11

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
although to be honest I suspect Marcela

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.220 
although to be honest I suspect Marcela
would<00:05:19.460> probably<00:05:19.700> play<00:05:19.910> left<00:05:20.180> back<00:05:20.300> anyway<00:05:20.690> and

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
would probably play left back anyway and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.140 
would probably play left back anyway and
also<00:05:21.470> because<00:05:22.010> you've<00:05:22.430> gotten<00:05:22.670> over<00:05:22.820> and<00:05:23.090> it

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
also because you've gotten over and it

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.670 
also because you've gotten over and it

means Pepe ramus which means no chance

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.290 
means Pepe ramus which means no chance

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
for a misplay right back which means of

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.390 
for a misplay right back which means of

you<00:05:59.630> would<00:05:59.750> have<00:05:59.870> thought<00:06:00.050> that<00:06:00.110> they<00:06:00.380> would

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
you would have thought that they would

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.350 
you would have thought that they would
be<00:06:00.590> more<00:06:00.860> than<00:06:00.920> hey<00:06:01.190> I<00:06:01.370> don't<00:06:01.670> is<00:06:01.820> any<00:06:02.000> doubt<00:06:02.180> I

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
be more than hey I don't is any doubt I

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.400 
be more than hey I don't is any doubt I
think<00:06:02.420> that<00:06:02.690> what's<00:06:02.960> going<00:06:03.080> to<00:06:03.140> be<00:06:03.230> very

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
think that what's going to be very

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.690 
think that what's going to be very
interesting<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:03.980> the<00:06:04.100> combination<00:06:04.640> of

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
interesting is the combination of

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.490 
interesting is the combination of
results<00:06:05.060> between<00:06:05.180> khalasar<00:06:05.810> Copenhagen<00:06:06.380> you

results between khalasar Copenhagen you

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.860 
results between khalasar Copenhagen you

ventus because there's virtually nothing
