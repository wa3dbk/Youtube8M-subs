work this is a bit that I find to be

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.270 
work this is a bit that I find to be
very<00:00:05.910> effective<00:00:06.509> good<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.799> horse<00:00:08.040> and

question<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.910> go<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> compete<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.930> sometimes

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
question we go to compete we sometimes

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
question we go to compete we sometimes
choose<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> little

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
choose a bit that's going to be a little

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
choose a bit that's going to be a little
more<00:00:27.000> assertive<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> have

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
more assertive because we have to have

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
more assertive because we have to have
that<00:00:28.890> ultimate<00:00:29.429> control<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> comes<00:00:30.269> with

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that ultimate control that comes with

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
that ultimate control that comes with
the<00:00:31.109> use<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> different<00:00:31.710> kinds<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> leverages

the use of different kinds of leverages

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.760 
the use of different kinds of leverages
we're<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> look<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.260> bit<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
we're going to look at this bit and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
we're going to look at this bit and
recognize<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> those

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
recognize that we do have some of those

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630 
recognize that we do have some of those
design<00:00:37.410> features<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.129> kind<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
design features that are kind to the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.510 
design features that are kind to the
horse<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> dog<00:00:39.629> bone<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> center

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
horse we have the dog bone in the center

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
horse we have the dog bone in the center
preventing<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> Nutcracker<00:00:42.239> effect<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:43.440> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
preventing the Nutcracker effect we have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.299 
preventing the Nutcracker effect we have
cut<00:00:43.950> sweet<00:00:44.730> iron<00:00:44.940> inlay<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.920> allows

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
cut sweet iron inlay here that allows

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.029 
cut sweet iron inlay here that allows
for<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> horse<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.030> salivate<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> has<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> fast

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
for the horse to salivate it has a fast

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
for the horse to salivate it has a fast
twist<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> bring<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> be

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
twist which is going to bring it to be

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
twist which is going to bring it to be
just<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.710> more<00:00:52.949> assertive<00:00:53.219> than

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
just that little bit more assertive than

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630 
just that little bit more assertive than
no<00:00:54.059> twists<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> slow<00:00:55.110> twist<00:00:55.440> giving<00:00:56.100> contour

no twists or a slow twist giving contour
and<00:00:56.850> texture<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> make<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> horse<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and texture to make that horse want to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.130 
and texture to make that horse want to
be<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> little<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.250> focused<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> say<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
be just a little more focused we say the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
be just a little more focused we say the
really<00:01:01.500> unique<00:01:01.800> feature<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> we

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
really unique feature of this and we

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.780 
really unique feature of this and we
sometimes<00:01:03.570> call<00:01:03.960> these<00:01:04.229> an<00:01:04.430> elevator<00:01:05.430> bit

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
sometimes call these an elevator bit

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.300 
sometimes call these an elevator bit
some<00:01:06.390> people<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.810> refer<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.409> gag<00:01:07.950> bits

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
some people do refer to them as gag bits

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
some people do refer to them as gag bits
we'll<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> look<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> feature<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
we'll want to look at the feature and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.370 
we'll want to look at the feature and
how<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.770> works<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.970> its<00:01:12.270> proper<00:01:12.720> position<00:01:12.900> on

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
how that works in its proper position on

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830 
how that works in its proper position on
the<00:01:13.500> horse<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.340> should<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.000> piece<00:01:15.509> should

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the horse this should this piece should

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929 
the horse this should this piece should
be<00:01:15.900> relaxed<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.740> hanging<00:01:17.159> nicely<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
be relaxed and hanging nicely in the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.929 
be relaxed and hanging nicely in the
horse's<00:01:18.330> mouth<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.320> rest<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> horse

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
horse's mouth when at rest as a horse

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
horse's mouth when at rest as a horse
becomes<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.810> stronger<00:01:22.259> more

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
becomes a little bit stronger more

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
becomes a little bit stronger more
aggressive<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> their<00:01:23.310> desire<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> compete<00:01:24.119> as

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
aggressive in their desire to compete as

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.010 
aggressive in their desire to compete as
we<00:01:24.990> pull<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.070> ought<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.400> slide<00:01:27.119> upward

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
we pull back this ought to slide upward

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
we pull back this ought to slide upward
and<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.369> create<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.570> more

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and as you can see create a little more

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
and as you can see create a little more
tension<00:01:31.170> putting<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.369> pressure<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
tension putting more pressure to the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
tension putting more pressure to the
roof<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> horse's<00:01:34.049> mouth<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
roof of the horse's mouth as all the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
roof of the horse's mouth as all the
other<00:01:35.640> leverage<00:01:36.090> bits<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.689> curb<00:01:36.990> chain<00:01:37.020> in

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
other leverage bits this curb chain in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.999 
other leverage bits this curb chain in
place<00:01:37.700> would<00:01:38.700> put<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.420> assertive<00:01:39.930> hold<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
place would put a very assertive hold to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.780 
place would put a very assertive hold to
the<00:01:41.159> horse's<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.689> rises<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
the horse's bit as it rises up and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
the horse's bit as it rises up and
creates<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:45.149> contact<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:46.350> pressure<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
creates more contact more pressure and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.770 
creates more contact more pressure and
so<00:01:47.549> you'll<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> horse<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.390> let's<00:01:48.570> call
