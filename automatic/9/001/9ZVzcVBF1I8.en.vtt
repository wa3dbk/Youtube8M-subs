when I took the product out of the box

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.340 
when I took the product out of the box
it<00:00:49.090> just<00:00:49.300> looks<00:00:49.480> like<00:00:49.600> this<00:00:50.280> quite<00:00:51.280> simple<00:00:51.699> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it just looks like this quite simple and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.979

thought<00:00:56.230> this<00:00:56.350> BB<00:00:56.710> cream<00:00:56.739> it'd<00:00:57.070> be<00:00:57.219> more<00:00:57.399> like

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
thought this BB cream it'd be more like

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.740 
thought this BB cream it'd be more like
a<00:00:58.859> lotion<00:00:59.859> like<00:01:00.399> a<00:01:00.429> nice<00:01:00.760> light<00:01:01.120> lotion<00:01:01.600> that

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
a lotion like a nice light lotion that

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.360 
a lotion like a nice light lotion that
would<00:01:01.870> actually<00:01:02.019> just<00:01:02.320> blend<00:01:02.679> into<00:01:02.890> my<00:01:03.070> skin

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
would actually just blend into my skin

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.520 
would actually just blend into my skin
tone<00:01:03.579> but<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.330> actually<00:01:04.570> acts<00:01:05.049> more<00:01:05.320> like<00:01:05.379> a

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
tone but it actually acts more like a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.710 
tone but it actually acts more like a
tinted<00:01:05.920> moisturizer<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:07.180> it's<00:01:07.390> giving<00:01:07.689> me

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
tinted moisturizer so it's giving me

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.810 
tinted moisturizer so it's giving me
some<00:01:08.049> coverage<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:09.130> was<00:01:09.250> really<00:01:09.520> really

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
some coverage and it was really really

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.120 
some coverage and it was really really
moisturizing<00:01:10.630> which<00:01:10.810> my<00:01:11.020> skin<00:01:11.350> definitely

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
moisturizing which my skin definitely

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.760 
moisturizing which my skin definitely
needs<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:13.240> if<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.600> have<00:01:13.720> oily<00:01:13.990> skin<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:14.619> would

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
needs so if you have oily skin I would

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.950 
needs so if you have oily skin I would
not<00:01:14.920> recommend<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.490> BB<00:01:15.850> cream<00:01:15.880> at<00:01:16.299> all<00:01:16.600> it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
not recommend this BB cream at all it's

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.499 
not recommend this BB cream at all it's
a<00:01:17.560> very<00:01:17.799> heavy<00:01:18.100> moisturizer<00:01:18.759> so<00:01:19.210> if<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.390> have

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
a very heavy moisturizer so if you have

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.780 
a very heavy moisturizer so if you have
dry<00:01:19.689> skin<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.229> will<00:01:20.320> definitely<00:01:20.650> solve<00:01:21.130> that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
dry skin it will definitely solve that

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.749 
dry skin it will definitely solve that
dry<00:01:22.509> flakiness<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.619> may<00:01:23.770> have<00:01:24.040> or<00:01:24.340> even

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
dry flakiness that you may have or even

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.410 
dry flakiness that you may have or even
like<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:26.259> sunburn<00:01:26.950> dryness<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.729> really<00:01:28.240> think

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
like like sunburn dryness I really think

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.380 
like like sunburn dryness I really think
that<00:01:28.689> this<00:01:29.170> BB<00:01:29.500> cream<00:01:29.530> is<00:01:29.950> really<00:01:30.880> great<00:01:31.210> at

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390
