00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.510
 have to give my update so goes 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.269
 I have to say I feel up today 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 in any case much fitter than the last 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.279
 days my body has become 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.520
 well then we deserve today we lead 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.740
 times in the kitchen I am with you 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 I want to bake delicious bread tomorrow 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 that's the eighth day that's me 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 can be thought to have breakfast again 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.780
 I have lunch until now 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 a feast time taken to me and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.250
 otherwise ammersee and yes today until sunday 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 So much make-up on the face and yes 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.289
 keep seeing bad skin 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.270
 can 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.039
 I'm sorry but that's the process 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 the detox before we start what 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.420
 I might say that briefly 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 I have not been around for half a year 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:07.530
 bought bread and rolls more food 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.970
 if i take my process and thus too 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 do that most bread that he gets 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.720
 Of course also industrially processed 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 is and if you take part and 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.340
 read through it all 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.340
 find preservatives 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.480
 actually it's the packaging 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.230
 chemistry 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.700
 rather than real lives and I have me 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.710
 in the last video that tells me 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.030
 changed diet and yes me 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.920
 I have often baked bread but 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.560
 today it will be a very special bread 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 and two white bread or so-called low 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.490
 carb red as you know are in 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.320
 conventional bread too many 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 carbohydrates that is to say so 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.240
 So much starch is in there and sugar 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.100
 again, too little protein at one 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.400
 low carb we turn these ratios 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.830
 so that the protein content is increased 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.340
 and as few carbohydrates as possible 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.770
 are included so we need 250 grams 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.930
 lean quark has four eggs in it 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.210
 Original recipe is six but because 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.150
 cholesterol we take a pack 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.540
 baking powder and railway stations as well as 100 grams 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.950
 ground almonds then 100 ill 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.330
 steps linseeds and also wheat bran 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.550
 five tablespoons we need to from 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.090
 after that wheat bran is what of 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.980
 wheat falls off and that 's it normal 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.540
 wheat more actually indignant fuller 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.270
 Switzerland makes and small as far as 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.760
 just a little bit salt and 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.980
 spelled wholemeal bread two tablespoons thereof 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.750
 only I resisted things because think 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.070
 the healthiest crop is what you are 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.080
 you can get and a healthier 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.850
 alternative to wheat or knows me 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.060
 First, the croaking of the eggs comes in one 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.060
 Bowl 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.270
 and mix of whole with a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
 Pack of tartar powder and me 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.190
 find it very good with this one here 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.190
 the gluten and phosphate series 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.490
 all we stir then a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 nice day 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.720
 By the way, I have the recipe of kolja 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.100
 he found yes on youtube 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.620
 beach becomes the trainer and videos 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.780
 with exercise and also 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.299
 if the dough is nicely smooth it comes 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.830
 our cracked flax seeds like that and me 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.940
 would recommend you a higher one 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.950
 bowl to take 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.849
 that's why 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.590
 then comes the ground almonds 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.950
 mean hazelnut they go too i like 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:02.690
 some like the bin and the whole that 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:06.560
 the dough then determined by us at 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.410
 falcon things then come two tablespoons 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.560
 and the whole thing further mingled 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.730
 until then the white dress and a word 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:22.070
 and I have and of it are done 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.070
 and on it goes with the stir then 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.360
 There is another pack of yeast added 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.240
 make sure he shows on her 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.870
 will rise 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.680
 and then the last step becomes one 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.130
 Teaspoon salt is equal to us and 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.030
 stir it all up before putting it in the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.030
 cake mold can come 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.250
 So that's our finished dough with you 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.720
 just the right consistency as you 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.979
 can not see too fat but not so 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.289
 because liquid then for me then 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.080
 right in this silicone cake pan a lot 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.910
 elastic as you can see and such a 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.250
 of your own very good about red or 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.300
 also to bake cake 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.479
 Much easier is the distribution 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.630
 book and or bread figures after it 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:38.320
 to highlight I describe the floor 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:40.330
 a little flour and so gives our 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.180
 bread dough I will now in the 180th 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.260
 grad preheated oven into and tour 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.330
 about 30 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.340
 We let ourselves stand in between 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.860
 See you later again 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:00.320
 three quarters of an hour is up and I have 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.930
 that just out of it not in any case 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.340
 very well 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.430
 I think she is also very good at it 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.200
 really smells 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.170
 I have a lattice to cool down 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.960
 put about four hours to cool 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.790
 After that, it should be in the refrigerator meyer 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.770
 and daring are included 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.770
 seems to have become so fluffy 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.900
