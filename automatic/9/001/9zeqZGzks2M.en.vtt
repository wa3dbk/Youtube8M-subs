00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.155
 We make filled pots in a cauldron 

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.626
 Ingredients: 

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:22.658
 1/2 pound minced pork 

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:24.790
 10 dg rice, half cooked 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.051
 3 dl tomato juice 

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:33.023
 2 dl tomato paste 

00:00:33.023 --> 00:00:36.865
 6-7 peppers 

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:40.293
 1 tablespoon of salt 

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:42.606
 1 bay leaf 

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:46.856
 1 teaspoon ground red pepper 

00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:49.325
 1 coffee spoon ground pepper 

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:51.155
 1 clove of garlic 

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.184
 1 teaspoon of fat 

00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:55.773
 1 tablespoon of flour 

00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:58.998
 1 onion in golden color 

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:03.394
 so much salty hot water that drips the dumplings 

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:07.126
 4-5 strands of green parsley 

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:08.559
 Preparation: 

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:14.387
 Mix the meat, rice, and spices in a bowl 

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:16.274
 the chopped garlic 

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:21.687
 the prepared onions 

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:29.191
 all spices 

00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:44.556
 we work well together 

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:51.155
 a little rest 

00:01:51.155 --> 00:02:22.062
 during this time we remove the inside of the parika 

00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:25.164
 After 20 minutes 

00:02:25.164 --> 00:02:41.828
 we start charging 

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.982
 because the rice has been pre-cooked 

00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:55.533
 it will not be very brown 

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:28.058
 if you stay from our meat filling, 

00:03:28.058 --> 00:03:36.772
 we can make dumplings by adding an egg 

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:41.538
 and we'll put it in the tomato paste 

00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:46.686
 we can put a roll of crumbs on it 

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:57.461
 put the peppers in the kettle 

00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:05.986
 pour the tomato paste 

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:10.443
 the tomato juice 

00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:16.791
 let go of water 

00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:24.622
 just cover it 

00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:30.348
 after firing, add bay leaf and parsley green 

00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:35.929
 and cook on a slow fire under cover 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:39.329
 20 minutes from the source 

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:59.668
 insert the dumplings. 

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:09.661
 shake to sink well 

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:14.521
 and return the lid 

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:45.357
 After 10 minutes, add 2 tablespoons of fat and 1 tablespoon of flour. 

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:52.900
 then boil for five minutes 

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:19.554
 served with salted boiled potatoes 

00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:27.176
 Enjoy your meal!
