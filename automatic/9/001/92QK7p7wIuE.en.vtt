00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
again this one also requires a lot of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.050 
again this one also requires a lot of
waiting<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.739> we<00:02:45.769> wait<00:02:46.160> wait<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.580> will<00:02:46.819> wait

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
waiting so we wait wait we will wait

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.809 
waiting so we wait wait we will wait
until<00:02:47.590> Dom<00:02:48.590> takes<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.980> nice<00:02:49.130> little<00:02:49.310> piss<00:02:49.580> then

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
these are two separate challenges that

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.820 
these are two separate challenges that
both<00:02:58.459> need<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.849> be<00:02:58.940> completed<00:02:59.690> before<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.680> can

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
both need to be completed before you can

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.320

this<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.959> doing<00:03:03.170> one<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.500> then<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.799> other

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
this of doing one and then the other

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.610 
this of doing one and then the other
because<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.330> course<00:03:05.540> he<00:03:05.870> won't<00:03:06.079> be<00:03:06.170> alive<00:03:06.410> for

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
because of course he won't be alive for

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.140 
because of course he won't be alive for
both<00:03:06.739> those<00:03:06.859> things<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.190> even<00:03:07.400> if<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.579> restart

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.810 
both those things so even if you restart
you<00:03:08.780> won't<00:03:08.989> be<00:03:09.109> able<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.470> keep<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.370> challenges

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you won't be able to keep the challenges

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
because it really does help when we go

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.740 
because it really does help when we go
into<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.049> final<00:03:15.530> area<00:03:15.739> now<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.030> right

near<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.890> checkpoints<00:03:19.730> basically<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.870> is

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
near the checkpoints basically this is

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.660 
near the checkpoints basically this is
the<00:03:21.200> exit<00:03:21.560> now<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.739> can<00:03:22.040> go<00:03:22.190> two<00:03:22.250> different
