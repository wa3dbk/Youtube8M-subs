00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
so let's start off by talking about the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.670 
so let's start off by talking about the
flip<00:00:29.910> capability<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.930> since<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.380> right

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
flip capability of this since it's right

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.470 
flip capability of this since it's right
in<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.860> name<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.010> the<00:00:32.130> product<00:00:32.340> pick<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> up

perfect<00:00:41.310> let's<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.090> over<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.510> bit<00:00:42.690> about

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
perfect let's go over a little bit about

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
perfect let's go over a little bit about
what's<00:00:43.080> under<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.380> hood<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> guy<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
what's under the hood in this guy so it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.400 
what's under the hood in this guy so it
has<00:00:44.880> like<00:00:45.120> quad-core<00:00:45.750> chip<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.320> either

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
has like quad-core chip you can either

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
has like quad-core chip you can either
get<00:00:46.650> it<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.100> four<00:00:47.280> gigs<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> ram<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
get it with two or four gigs of ram and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.390 
get it with two or four gigs of ram and
16<00:00:49.020> gigs<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.290> long<00:00:49.410> board<00:00:49.590> storage<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.280> there

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
16 gigs a long board storage so there

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.290 
16 gigs a long board storage so there
are<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> lot<00:00:50.580> of<00:00:50.610> companies<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.150> are<00:00:51.270> making

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
are a lot of companies that are making

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479 
are a lot of companies that are making
Chromebooks<00:00:51.989> what<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.890> acs<00:00:53.280> doing

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
Chromebooks what is acs doing

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.940 
Chromebooks what is acs doing
differently<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.989> flip<00:00:55.410> form<00:00:55.620> factor<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
differently so the flip form factor is

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.160 
differently so the flip form factor is
pretty<00:00:56.130> unique<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:57.390> gets<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.960> good

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pretty unique it gets really good

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.080 
pretty unique it gets really good
battery<00:00:58.470> life<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> 9<00:00:59.400> hours<00:00:59.430> we

you but for the most part there's pretty
good<00:03:18.010> crossover<00:03:18.370> between<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.850> two<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:20.050> lot

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
good crossover between the two and a lot

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.390
