00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and you see this weird bellows adapter

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.580 
and you see this weird bellows adapter
that<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.460> attached<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.030> lens<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
that I have attached to the lens and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.010 
that I have attached to the lens and
that's<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> macro<00:00:35.250> slider<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.360> talked

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that's on a macro slider also I talked

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
that's on a macro slider also I talked
about<00:00:37.110> macro<00:00:37.620> slider<00:00:37.860> earlier<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
about macro slider earlier this is a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.650 
about macro slider earlier this is a
different<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:40.829> mount<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.670> lens<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
different one so you mount your lens in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
different one so you mount your lens in
the<00:00:42.750> front<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.489> bellows<00:00:44.510> camera<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the front of the bellows camera in the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
the front of the bellows camera in the
back<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.829> adjust<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.190> lens

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
back and then you can adjust your lens

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.549 
back and then you can adjust your lens
forward<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.030> back<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> camera<00:00:48.690> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
forward and back from the camera it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
forward and back from the camera it's
kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> magnify<00:00:50.340> what's<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.789> front<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
kind of magnify what's in front of it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.139 
kind of magnify what's in front of it
now<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.800> further<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.430> moves<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
now the further this moves out the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
now the further this moves out the
closer<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.750> object<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> lens

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
closer this object has to be to the lens

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
closer this object has to be to the lens
and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.670> actually<00:00:57.480> closer<00:00:57.780> than

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and you can get actually closer than

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.860 
and you can get actually closer than
what<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.100> showing<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:02.690> get<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
what I'm showing you now get this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.219 
what I'm showing you now get this
started<00:01:04.140> again<00:01:08.299> we<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.450> actually<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.810> closer

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
started again we can actually get closer

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:20.390 
started again we can actually get closer
than<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:12.020> oops<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> detail

bellows<00:01:34.490> I'll<00:01:35.490> post<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> link<00:01:36.619> try<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.829> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
bellows I'll post a link try it out it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
bellows I'll post a link try it out it
works<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.520> both<00:01:38.700> photos<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> video<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:42.450> only

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
works for both photos and video the only

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.170 
works for both photos and video the only
problem<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.700> when<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> start<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.360> t2i

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
problem is when you start the t2i

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.960 
problem is when you start the t2i
it's<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> detect<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> lens<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it's not going to detect the lens so you

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's not going to detect the lens so you
want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> make<00:01:51.299> sure<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.670> click

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
want to make sure that you just click

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.840 
want to make sure that you just click
the<00:01:54.060> button<00:01:54.090> again<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.490> doing<00:01:56.610> video

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the button again if you're doing video

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
the button again if you're doing video
and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> works<00:01:57.750> fine<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:59.399> best<00:01:59.579> tripod

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and then it works fine the best tripod

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
and then it works fine the best tripod
set<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.680> want<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> show

set up right now but I just want to show

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.609 
set up right now but I just want to show
you<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.219> example<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.810> what<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.960> fellas<00:02:04.380> can
