and then all we need to do is build a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.359 
and then all we need to do is build a
countertop<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:18.779> over<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.369> important

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
essentially what we do is we use the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.950 
essentially what we do is we use the
base<00:00:33.420> cabinet<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:35.149> our<00:00:36.149> primary

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
table on this end now what works nicely

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.640 
table on this end now what works nicely
as<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.390> rolling<00:01:15.869> cabinet<00:01:16.110> here

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
as that this rolling cabinet here

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.149 
as that this rolling cabinet here
actually<00:01:17.310> slides<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.450> slides<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:19.159> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
actually slides in and slides out so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.749 
actually slides in and slides out so
that<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.119> versatility<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:22.759> your

typical work space like this or a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.390 
typical work space like this or a
workbench<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.259> 18<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> 24<00:01:41.340> inches

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
workbench and you know 18 to 24 inches

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
workbench and you know 18 to 24 inches
on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> depth<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> give<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> plenty

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
on the depth is going to give you plenty

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.389 
on the depth is going to give you plenty
and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.540> about<00:01:45.840> six<00:01:46.290> feet<00:01:46.500> wide<00:01:46.740> now

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and then this is about six feet wide now

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
and then this is about six feet wide now
a<00:01:47.430> nice<00:01:47.729> element<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.689> over<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
a nice element that you can do over the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.780 
a nice element that you can do over the
top<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.450> put<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> peg<00:01:51.869> board<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.649> here

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
top of it is put a peg board over here

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.980 
top of it is put a peg board over here
and<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.270> death<00:01:54.509> behind<00:01:54.810> your

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and you want some death behind your

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.709 
and you want some death behind your
pegboard<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.299> take<00:01:57.479> our

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
pegboard so what we do is we take our

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.850 
pegboard so what we do is we take our
trim<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.350> we're<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.049> dado<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.619> trim

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
trim and we're out a dado in the trim

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.859 
trim and we're out a dado in the trim
that's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> quarter<00:02:02.460> inch<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.030> basically

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that's a quarter inch and basically

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.010 
that's a quarter inch and basically
build<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> frame<00:02:04.680> around<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:06.210> peg<00:02:06.509> board<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
build a frame around this peg board and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
build a frame around this peg board and
attach<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> wall<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.539> can

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
attach it to the wall and then you can

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.540 
attach it to the wall and then you can
