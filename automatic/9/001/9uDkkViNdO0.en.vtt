00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.200
 Maria and I 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 "Saturday night, to be precise Sunday morning" 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.480
 "I am walking in the rain. I went back to karaoke with my byte mates. " 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.180
 "Everyone was excited as the girls who picked up in the city were excited, and each went to the hotel." 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.690
 "Politely, one of them borrows from me to the hotel charges ..." 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 "Not interesting. Why everyone can do it so easily. 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.540
 "do not know…" 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.090
 "Thanks to me, I missed the last train, and in this rain, I walked for nearly two hours endlessly ..." 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.460
 "Hmm! ? It is a police car. I wonder if it was an incident ... " 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 "If you say so, a lot of police cars are gathered at the station" 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 Let's ask what happened 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.190
 "A Southeast Asian-like weird guy ..." 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.850
 "What happened?" 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.870
 "In the cold rain, my feet are getting heavier and heavier." 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.770
 "! ? " 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.580
 "Who is there? " 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.430
 "The moan ... a woman? " 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.730
 "Brown skin, big black eyes ..." 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.000
 "It is a Southeast Asian person ..." 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.510
 "If you look closely, you are bleeding from the forehead ..." 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.550
 "What should I do…" 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.740
 Let's give it a try 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.050
 "This was my encounter with Maria ..." 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.520
 "I carried her back and aimed at my apartment" 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.940
 "The word of a Southeast Asian suspicious person is remembered" 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.260
 "I do not want to think that she is ..." 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.970
 "For now, for now, let's leave to ask so many things" 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.030
 "Still ..." 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.660
 "I feel her body temperature through wet clothes. I'm still drunk ... " 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.770
 "I rushed to the apartment while pounding" 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.290
 "Always I go through the alley on the left, but I will do it." 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.210
 Right is a bit far, but it's a wide and safe way 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.470
 "I'm going around a little, but I can't help ..." 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.060
 "It's a police car. I'm sorry. " 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.430
 "What if you were that police officer .... And now it's ... 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.590
 "I'm scared ..." 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.670
 "Clearly she hates the police. What should I do…? " 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.910
 "It will be found as it is" 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.000
 Run and run away 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.850
 Flee to a residential area 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.900
 "I ran with Maria on my back" 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.250
 "Soon, if you turn that corner ..." 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.010
 "I thought so ..." 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.990
 "We were suddenly caught in a strong light" 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.290
 "No way ..., so many police cars were patrolling ..." 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.670
 "But Maria ... what did you do? " 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.870
 "Was you ...? " 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.190
 A moment
