using into dfu mode so go ahead and put

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
using into dfu mode so go ahead and put
that<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> dfu<00:01:25.799> mode<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> should

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that in the dfu mode and then you should

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620 
that in the dfu mode and then you should
be<00:01:27.540> good<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.790> once<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.390> in

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
be good to go here so once that is in

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
be good to go here so once that is in
dfu<00:01:31.020> mode<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.829> should<00:01:32.340> automatically

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
dfu mode it should automatically

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.690 
dfu mode it should automatically
recognize<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.740> dfu<00:01:35.159> mode<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.579> as

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
recognize that it is in dfu mode and as

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
recognize that it is in dfu mode and as
you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.360> did<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.990> going

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can see it did and it's going

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.580 
you can see it did and it's going
through<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> exploit<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.590> it'll

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
through the exploit right now and it'll

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
through the exploit right now and it'll
go<00:01:40.770> through<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.369> jailbreak<00:01:41.790> your

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
go through this and jailbreak your

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.580 
go through this and jailbreak your
device<00:01:42.390> now<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.930> does<00:01:43.200> take<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> while

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
device now this does take a while

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.090 
device now this does take a while
especially<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.380> moving<00:01:46.380> application

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
especially when it's moving application

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.289 
especially when it's moving application
so<00:01:47.310> you're<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.270> just

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so you're going to see that here in just

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.539 
so you're going to see that here in just

a second so it's downloading the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.240 
a second so it's downloading the
jailbreak<00:01:50.909> data<00:01:51.409> super<00:01:52.409> simple<00:01:52.590> process

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
jailbreak data super simple process

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.609 
jailbreak data super simple process
really<00:01:54.149> can't<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.509> wrong<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:57.619> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
really can't go wrong with it and the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.120 
really can't go wrong with it and the
familiar<00:02:00.049> matrix<00:02:01.049> screen<00:02:01.469> i<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> call<00:02:02.070> it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
familiar matrix screen i like to call it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.999 
familiar matrix screen i like to call it
and<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.780> scroll<00:02:04.619> through<00:02:04.649> here

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
and this will just scroll through here

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.419 
and this will just scroll through here
for<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:06.290> for<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.799> minute<00:02:08.250> or

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
for a little bit for about a minute or

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.180 
for a little bit for about a minute or
so<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:09.899> you'll<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.770> familiar

home<00:02:30.090> screen<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.440> now<00:02:31.650> let's<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.520> look<00:02:32.610> at

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
home screen so now let's take a look at

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.210 
home screen so now let's take a look at
our<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:34.290> an<00:02:34.380> ipod<00:02:34.710> touch<00:02:34.980> but

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
our that's actually an ipod touch but

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
our that's actually an ipod touch but
same<00:02:35.490> difference<00:02:35.700> let's<00:02:36.300> take<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.450> look<00:02:36.630> at<00:02:36.660> our

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
same difference let's take a look at our

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.660 
same difference let's take a look at our
ipod<00:02:37.500> touch<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.980> should<00:02:38.160> see<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.400> moving

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
ipod touch you should see it moving

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.030 
ipod touch you should see it moving
applications<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.600> what<00:02:40.050> takes<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
applications this is what takes the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.740 
applications this is what takes the
majority<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.520> time<00:02:41.730> I've<00:02:41.940> actually<00:02:42.060> sped<00:02:42.600> this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
majority of time I've actually sped this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.140 
majority of time I've actually sped this
up<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.050> bit<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.130> convenience<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:45.030> this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
up a bit for your convenience but this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.540 
up a bit for your convenience but this
probably<00:02:45.750> takes<00:02:46.020> upwards<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.890> five<00:02:47.130> minutes

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
probably takes upwards of five minutes

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.430 
probably takes upwards of five minutes
to<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.940> moving<00:02:48.360> application<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.320> be

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
