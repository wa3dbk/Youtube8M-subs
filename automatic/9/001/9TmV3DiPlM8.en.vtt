can take it all the way down to gray so

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.110 
can take it all the way down to gray so
that<00:02:42.510> totally<00:02:43.170> diss<00:02:43.320> actuated<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.790> then<00:02:45.000> you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
that they have the same name right so

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.740 
that they have the same name right so
they're<00:04:01.380> going<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.090> duplicate<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:03.720> we

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
they're going is it is duplicate what we

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.250 
they're going is it is duplicate what we
had<00:04:04.019> before<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.820> let<00:04:06.390> me<00:04:06.420> go<00:04:06.630> back<00:04:06.660> here<00:04:06.870> make

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
had before so let me go back here make

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.370 
had before so let me go back here make
that<00:04:07.410> larger<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.480> I'm<00:04:09.540> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.750> select<00:04:09.930> all

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
that larger so I'm going to select all

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.820 
that larger so I'm going to select all
these<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:12.900> select<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:15.650> these<00:04:16.650> are

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
these and then select that these are

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.469 
these and then select that these are
basically<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.310> images<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:17.820> we<00:04:18.030> don't<00:04:18.150> want

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
basically the images that we don't want

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.599 
basically the images that we don't want
changed<00:04:18.959> or<00:04:19.140> we<00:04:19.229> don't<00:04:19.410> want<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.580> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
changed or we don't want to have a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.790 
changed or we don't want to have a
different<00:04:20.910> hue<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.750> saturation<00:04:21.780> value<00:04:22.590> for

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
different hue and saturation value for

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.379 
different hue and saturation value for
and<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.580> think<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.419> rest<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.990> okay

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
and I think the rest is okay

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.950 
and I think the rest is okay
so<00:04:28.389> let<00:04:28.510> me<00:04:28.600> copy<00:04:28.750> those<00:04:29.080> ones<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:31.630> go

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
so let me copy those ones and then go

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.070 
so let me copy those ones and then go
back<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.229> new<00:04:33.220> resources<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:34.479> then<00:04:34.930> paste<00:04:35.199> up

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
back to new resources and then paste up

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.980 
back to new resources and then paste up
now<00:04:38.080> let's<00:04:38.290> replace<00:04:40.350> everything<00:04:42.750> okay<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:43.810> if

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
now let's replace everything okay so if

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.140 
now let's replace everything okay so if
you<00:04:44.080> look<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.470> images<00:04:45.100> again<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.880> we<00:04:46.000> have

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
you look up the images again so we have

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.689 
you look up the images again so we have
okay<00:04:46.540> images<00:04:46.900> for<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.229> for<00:04:47.889> the<00:04:47.919> pictures<00:04:48.400> and

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
okay images for the for the pictures and

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.270 
okay images for the for the pictures and
then<00:04:48.910> we<00:04:49.030> have<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.330> new<00:04:49.540> green<00:04:50.100> tents<00:04:51.100> for

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
then we have the new green tents for

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.879 
then we have the new green tents for
that<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:52.330> now<00:04:52.449> we're<00:04:52.630> done<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.410> best<00:04:53.680> thing

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
that so now we're done to the best thing

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.770 
that so now we're done to the best thing
the<00:04:54.070> easiest<00:04:54.760> of<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.880> fastest<00:04:55.389> way<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.570> do

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
the easiest of the fastest way to do

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.020 
the easiest of the fastest way to do
that<00:04:55.960> is<00:04:56.020> basically<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.830> replace<00:04:57.820> our

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
that is basically to replace our

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.550 
that is basically to replace our
resources<00:04:58.419> folder<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:58.810> let<00:04:58.960> me<00:04:59.050> let<00:04:59.169> me<00:04:59.260> delete

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
resources folder so let me let me delete

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.810 
resources folder so let me let me delete
that<00:04:59.770> just<00:05:00.070> basically<00:05:00.310> remove<00:05:00.699> the

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
that just basically remove the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.719 
that just basically remove the
references<00:05:01.479> for<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.930> one<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.620> then<00:05:03.490> add<00:05:03.699> a

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
references for that one and then add a

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.390 
references for that one and then add a
new<00:05:06.810> folder<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:08.199> basically<00:05:08.500> add<00:05:08.710> files<00:05:09.010> and

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
new folder so basically add files and

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.689 
new folder so basically add files and
then<00:05:09.550> I'll<00:05:09.729> select<00:05:13.229> that<00:05:14.340> which<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.550> new

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
then I'll select that which is the new

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.460 
then I'll select that which is the new
folder<00:05:16.030> which<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.270> created<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.260> think

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
folder which you created and I think

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.189 
folder which you created and I think
you're<00:05:17.560> done<00:05:17.740> so<00:05:18.240> once<00:05:19.240> we<00:05:19.479> have<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:19.810> before

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
you're done so once we have this before

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.810 
you're done so once we have this before
so<00:05:20.440> let's<00:05:20.710> see<00:05:20.860> how<00:05:20.889> that<00:05:21.010> looks<00:05:21.190> like<00:05:21.520> when<00:05:21.729> we

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
so let's see how that looks like when we

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.120 
so let's see how that looks like when we
run<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.210> again<00:05:25.080> yeah<00:05:26.080> so<00:05:26.380> that's<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:26.949> now<00:05:27.070> we

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
run it again yeah so that's it so now we

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.610 
run it again yeah so that's it so now we
have<00:05:27.430> different<00:05:27.930> colors<00:05:28.930> or<00:05:29.050> not<00:05:29.139> you<00:05:29.289> all<00:05:29.470> it

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
have different colors or not you all it

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.950 
have different colors or not you all it
was<00:05:29.770> paying<00:05:30.130> for<00:05:30.340> Navi<00:05:30.550> screen<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:31.780> then<00:05:31.900> we

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
was paying for Navi screen and then we

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.620 
was paying for Navi screen and then we
can<00:05:32.110> see<00:05:32.349> that<00:05:32.500> all<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.940> color<00:05:34.210> scheme<00:05:34.389> as

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
can see that all the the color scheme as

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.730 
can see that all the the color scheme as
basically<00:05:34.960> change<00:05:35.169> so<00:05:35.289> see<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.530> background

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
basically change so see the background

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
this video um I just showed you how we

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.450 
this video um I just showed you how we
can<00:06:07.690> basically<00:06:08.229> take<00:06:08.500> any<00:06:08.830> template<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:09.310> have

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
can basically take any template you have

can basically take any template you have
formed<00:06:09.820> from<00:06:10.240> up<00:06:10.419> design<00:06:10.750> vault<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.199> then

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
formed from up design vault and then
