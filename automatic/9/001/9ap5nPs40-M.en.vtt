00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

I'm<00:00:00.060> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.079> try<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.260> show<00:00:01.380> you<00:00:01.410> some<00:00:01.560> stuff

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I'm going to try to show you some stuff

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.999 
I'm going to try to show you some stuff
about<00:00:01.949> complex<00:00:02.550> numbers<00:00:02.700> um<00:00:03.620> the<00:00:04.620> first<00:00:04.830> thing

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
about complex numbers um the first thing

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.710 
about complex numbers um the first thing
is<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.850> realize<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.480> can't

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
is you have to realize that you can't

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.740 
is you have to realize that you can't
use<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.109> letter<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.620> use<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.820> comes<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.570> like

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
use the letter I use I comes up like

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.560 
use the letter I use I comes up like
that<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.110> not<00:00:10.260> bold<00:00:10.610> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.849> kind<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
that it's not bold in the kind of the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.570 
that it's not bold in the kind of the
pikey<00:00:13.049> there's<00:00:13.559> an<00:00:13.740> eye<00:00:13.860> that's<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.460> one

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
pikey there's an eye that's the one

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.609 
pikey there's an eye that's the one
you're<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> need<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.089> use<00:00:15.529> it's<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
you're going to need to use it's a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.310 
you're going to need to use it's a
little<00:00:16.800> annoying<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.600> get<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> work<00:00:19.109> all

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
little annoying to get that to work all

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
little annoying to get that to work all
the<00:00:19.410> time<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:20.250> anyway<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:20.670> how<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.850> do

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the time but anyway that's how you do

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.189 
the time but anyway that's how you do
that<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.250> kinds<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.869> algebra<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that you do all kinds of algebra to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
that you do all kinds of algebra to
level<00:00:26.150> stuff<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.449> multiply<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:29.869> we

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
level stuff so you multiply them we

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.080 
level stuff so you multiply them we
could<00:00:31.050> divide<00:00:31.349> them<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.200> five<00:00:34.200> minus

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
could divide them to do that five minus

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.729 
could divide them to do that five minus
six<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> that's<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.870> I'm<00:00:39.989> good<00:00:40.260> obviously

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
six I and that's all I'm good obviously

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.729 
six I and that's all I'm good obviously
you<00:00:40.829> could<00:00:40.920> add<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> subtract<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:41.670> um<00:00:42.739> other

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you could add and subtract them um other

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.110 
you could add and subtract them um other
things<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.850> you're<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
things you can do which you're going to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
things you can do which you're going to
need<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.110> let<00:00:46.710> me<00:00:46.800> insert<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> different

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
need to do so let me insert a different

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.110 
need to do so let me insert a different
page<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:50.360> um<00:00:51.739> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.370> look<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.610> menu<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
page here um if you look in menu and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.660 
page here um if you look in menu and
numbers<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.110> complex<00:00:55.829> number<00:00:56.129> tools<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
numbers you get complex number tools and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.990 
numbers you get complex number tools and
then<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> complex<00:00:59.039> convey<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> real<00:00:59.760> part

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
then it's a complex convey a real part

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
then it's a complex convey a real part
imaginary<00:01:00.059> part<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.899> might<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.170> something

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
imaginary part we might do something

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
imaginary part we might do something
later<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.770> involves<00:01:02.070> those<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> mean

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
later that involves those but I mean

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.130 
later that involves those but I mean
mostly<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.449> look<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:03.989> see

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mostly you can just look at it and see

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
mostly you can just look at it and see
it<00:01:04.820> polar<00:01:05.820> angle<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> useful<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.400> polar

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it polar angle is useful so I do polar

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.660 
it polar angle is useful so I do polar
angle<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.270> three<00:01:09.479> minus<00:01:09.780> 3i<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> returns

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
angle and then three minus 3i it returns

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
angle and then three minus 3i it returns
the<00:01:14.970> direction<00:01:15.869> angle<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:16.470> looking

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the direction angle that we're looking

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.350 
the direction angle that we're looking
for<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.670> um<00:01:19.790> other<00:01:20.790> things<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
for so that's good um other things that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530 
for so that's good um other things that
we<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:22.759> that's<00:01:23.759> by<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.180> way<00:01:24.299> that's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
we want to do that's by the way that's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.310 
we want to do that's by the way that's
also<00:01:24.689> called<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> argument<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:27.320> complex

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
also called the argument of the complex

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.760 
also called the argument of the complex
number<00:01:29.090> go<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.390> complex<00:01:31.320> number<00:01:31.560> tools

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
number go back in complex number tools

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.030 
number go back in complex number tools
again<00:01:32.600> magnitude<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:34.350> magnitude<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
again magnitude now magnitude you can

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
again magnitude now magnitude you can
see<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.250> becomes<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> absolute<00:01:36.150> value

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
see just becomes the absolute value

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.280 
see just becomes the absolute value
which<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> would<00:01:37.890> expect<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.700> that's

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
which you would expect because that's

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
which you would expect because that's
what<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.470> defined<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.360> we<00:01:42.360> get<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.780> um

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
what it's defined to be we get that um

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350 
what it's defined to be we get that um
or<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.189> might<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> them<00:01:45.270> at

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
or you might want to get all of them at

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
or you might want to get all of them at
once<00:01:45.689> which<00:01:46.189> obviously<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.520> probably<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
once which obviously is probably a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.440 
once which obviously is probably a
better<00:01:47.939> choice<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.329> one

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
better choice and we can do this is one

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.410 
better choice and we can do this is one
of<00:01:51.540> those<00:01:51.659> things<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> takes<00:01:53.180> takes<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of those things that takes takes the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.929 
of those things that takes takes the
previous<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.470> need<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.939> look

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
previous thing so I need to do look

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.819 
previous thing so I need to do look
three<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.930> three<00:01:58.259> I<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.530> convert

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
three one is three I and it will convert

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
three one is three I and it will convert
it<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> polar<00:02:02.219> um<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> form<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it to polar um this is a form that you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.969 
it to polar um this is a form that you
should<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.899> seen<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> class<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:07.350> uses

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
should have seen in class it uses

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.949 
should have seen in class it uses
Euler's<00:02:08.310> formula<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> converts<00:02:09.840> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
Euler's formula and kind of converts it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.540 
Euler's formula and kind of converts it
for<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.480> angle<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
for you so we can see a the angle is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.620 
for you so we can see a the angle is
pi<00:02:13.940> over<00:02:14.150> four<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:16.250> magnitude<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:17.030> 3

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
pi over four and the magnitude is 3

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.100 
pi over four and the magnitude is 3
radical<00:02:17.900> 2<00:02:18.640> those<00:02:19.640> are<00:02:19.760> useful<00:02:20.110> something

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
radical 2 those are useful something

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.410 
radical 2 those are useful something
else<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.380> use<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.560> cyst<00:02:22.100> form<00:02:22.340> quite<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.640> bit<00:02:22.790> so

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
else we use a cyst form quite a bit so

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.930 
else we use a cyst form quite a bit so
you<00:02:24.200> might<00:02:24.350> find<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> much<00:02:25.160> easier<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.670> just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
you might find it much easier to just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.580 
you might find it much easier to just
define<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.570> new<00:02:26.750> function<00:02:26.960> this<00:02:28.240> R<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.900> T<00:02:30.230> or

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
define a new function this R and T or

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.810 
define a new function this R and T or
you<00:02:30.680> could<00:02:30.830> use<00:02:30.950> theta<00:02:31.190> if<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.460> wanted<00:02:31.670> to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
you could use theta if you wanted to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.450 
you could use theta if you wanted to
theta<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.270> uh<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.810> think<00:02:33.500> hiding<00:02:33.920> down<00:02:34.040> here<00:02:34.160> by

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
theta is uh I think hiding down here by

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.000 
theta is uh I think hiding down here by
PI<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:37.450> set<00:02:38.450> equal<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:39.860> it's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
PI and that set equal to and then it's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.670 
PI and that set equal to and then it's
going<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> be<00:02:40.280> R<00:02:41.470> times<00:02:44.260> parentheses<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.560> then

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
going to be R times parentheses and then

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.540 
going to be R times parentheses and then
we<00:02:45.860> do<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.060> cosine<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.410> theta<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.830> know<00:02:48.950> kind

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
we do a cosine of theta is you know kind

we do a cosine of theta is you know kind
of<00:02:49.610> committed<00:02:49.970> myself<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.420> using<00:02:50.660> theta<00:02:51.940> plus

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
of committed myself to using theta plus

I<00:02:53.240> which<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.020> back<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.770> key<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.540> then

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
I which is back in this key and then

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.960 
I which is back in this key and then
sign<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.210> obtain<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.630> next<00:02:59.780> enter<00:03:00.110> once

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
sign so this obtain the next enter once

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.370 
sign so this obtain the next enter once
but<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.330> advantage<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.960> only<00:03:03.140> have<00:03:03.290> to

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
but the advantage is you only have to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.510 
but the advantage is you only have to
enter<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.650> once<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.370> keep

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
enter it once and then you can just keep

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.340 
enter it once and then you can just keep
using<00:03:04.760> it

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
using it

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.760 
using it
sine<00:03:06.350> theta<00:03:06.880> like<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:09.050> if<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.230> press<00:03:09.380> var

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
sine theta like that now if I press var

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.000 
sine theta like that now if I press var
it's<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.850> there<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.270> this<00:03:11.360> problem<00:03:12.010> so

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it's just in there for this problem so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
if I want to do let's see 3 square root

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.100 
if I want to do let's see 3 square root
of<00:03:16.010> 2<00:03:16.870> whoops

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
comma negative PI over 4 it gives me

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.990

is<00:03:42.200> in<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.380> surprising<00:03:43.250> form<00:03:43.690> let's<00:03:44.690> take<00:03:44.870> that

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
is in a surprising form let's take that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.440 
is in a surprising form let's take that
and<00:03:45.350> convert<00:03:45.770> it<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:45.980> polar<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.910> because<00:03:47.300> we

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
and convert it to polar just because we

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.220 
and convert it to polar just because we
can<00:03:49.000> we<00:03:50.000> get<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.750> can<00:03:50.870> see<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.110> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
can we get that so you can see that the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.479 
can we get that so you can see that the
direction<00:03:51.530> angle<00:03:51.739> for<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:52.130> multiplication

direction angle for that multiplication

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.750 
direction angle for that multiplication
is<00:03:52.820> actually<00:03:53.180> PI<00:03:53.360> over<00:03:53.630> 6<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.760> magnitude

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
is actually PI over 6 and the magnitude

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.880 
is actually PI over 6 and the magnitude
is<00:03:55.820> 15<00:03:57.489> just<00:03:58.489> because<00:03:58.850> we<00:03:58.970> can<00:03:59.180> we<00:03:59.360> can<00:03:59.680> go<00:04:00.680> back

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
is 15 just because we can we can go back

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.310 
is 15 just because we can we can go back
into<00:04:01.100> number<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:01.790> complex<00:04:02.570> number<00:04:02.870> tools<00:04:03.080> and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
into number and complex number tools and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.449 
into number and complex number tools and
we<00:04:03.380> could<00:04:03.590> convert<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:04.130> back<00:04:04.190> to

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
we could convert that back to

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.750 
we could convert that back to
rectangular<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:06.170> going<00:04:06.350> in<00:04:06.410> loops<00:04:06.530> here<00:04:06.830> so

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
rectangular just going in loops here so

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.520 
rectangular just going in loops here so
those<00:04:07.850> are<00:04:08.030> some<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.239> really<00:04:08.540> basic<00:04:09.110> sort

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
those are some of the really basic sort

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.840 
those are some of the really basic sort
of<00:04:09.590> things<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.950> can<00:04:10.160> do<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.550> should<00:04:10.730> be

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
of things that you can do and should be

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.060 
of things that you can do and should be
able<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.030> do<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.269> your<00:04:11.420> calculator<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> hope

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
able to do on your calculator so I hope

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.989 
able to do on your calculator so I hope
that's<00:04:13.250> helpful<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.790> good<00:04:14.690> luck<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:14.959> that
