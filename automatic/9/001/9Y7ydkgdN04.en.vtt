mixer is really clean because otherwise

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.050

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
another Bowl cleaned it and then I put

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.080 
another Bowl cleaned it and then I put
my<00:01:51.340> egg<00:01:51.610> yolks<00:01:52.020> added<00:01:53.020> sugar<00:01:53.679> and<00:01:53.970> beat<00:01:54.970> it

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.950 
my egg yolks added sugar and beat it
until<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.539> got<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.780> nice<00:01:56.200> kokomo<00:01:57.130> Gill<00:01:57.340> which<00:01:57.610> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
until I got a nice kokomo Gill which is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.969 
until I got a nice kokomo Gill which is
looking<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.200> like<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.619> nice<00:02:00.330> yellow<00:02:01.330> and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.480 
looking just like that nice yellow and
fluffy<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.369> when<00:02:03.789> this<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.119> done<00:02:04.330> I'm<00:02:04.599> slowly

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
fluffy and when this is done I'm slowly

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.980 
fluffy and when this is done I'm slowly
adding<00:02:06.490> my<00:02:07.450> flour<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.770> cocoa<00:02:09.009> powder<00:02:09.130> mixture

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
adding my flour and cocoa powder mixture

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.470 
adding my flour and cocoa powder mixture
slowly<00:02:10.990> on<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.500> low<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.940> otherwise<00:02:13.239> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
slowly on the low because otherwise you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.559 
slowly on the low because otherwise you
will<00:02:13.630> get<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.349> flour<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:16.300> we<00:02:16.390> go

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
will get all the flour on you here we go

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.930 
will get all the flour on you here we go
and<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:17.470> when<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.800> looks<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.459> it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and then when it looks like this it's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.370 
and then when it looks like this it's
time<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.870> gradually<00:02:20.590> add<00:02:20.739> our<00:02:22.050> egg<00:02:23.050> whites

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
time to gradually add our egg whites

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.740 
time to gradually add our egg whites
we're<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.310> give<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.730> good<00:02:24.940> stir<00:02:25.360> so

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
we're going to give it a good stir so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.449 
we're going to give it a good stir so
nothing<00:02:26.110> sticks<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.739> walls<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.220> bowl

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
nothing sticks to the walls of the bowl

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.290 
nothing sticks to the walls of the bowl
and<00:02:28.230> then<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.470> did<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.130> four<00:02:30.430> steps<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.270> I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
and then I did it in four steps so I

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.500 
and then I did it in four steps so I
added<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.870> little<00:02:31.900> bit<00:02:32.310> give<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.670> stir<00:02:34.000> fold

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
added a little bit give it a stir fold

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.860 
added a little bit give it a stir fold
it<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.830> got<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.099> little<00:02:36.489> bit<00:02:36.880> more

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it in so it got a little bit more

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870 
it in so it got a little bit more
delicate<00:02:38.200> here<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:38.830> go<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> gets

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
delicate here you go so then it gets

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.320 
delicate here you go so then it gets
easier<00:02:40.800> when<00:02:41.800> we<00:02:41.950> add<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.400> next<00:02:42.760> part<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
easier when we add the next part of the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.910 
easier when we add the next part of the
egg<00:02:43.450> whites<00:02:43.720> they<00:02:44.050> don't<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.709> much

line it with the baking paper and then

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.679 
line it with the baking paper and then
we<00:03:12.319> put<00:03:12.560> all<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:13.489> batter<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:15.040> nicely

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
spread it with the spatula so it's even

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.539 
spread it with the spatula so it's even
then<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.420> will<00:03:20.569> tap<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.049> few<00:03:21.170> times<00:03:21.379> this<00:03:22.370> is

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
then I will tap it a few times this is

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.170 
then I will tap it a few times this is

going to be cutting it cutting it in

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.330 
going to be cutting it cutting it in
half<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.970> need<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.209> very<00:04:14.720> sharp<00:04:15.470> knife<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
half so you need a very sharp knife the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.939 
half so you need a very sharp knife the
being<00:04:16.549> dice<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.570> can<00:04:17.599> use<00:04:17.959> right<00:04:18.289> it<00:04:18.470> might

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
being dice you can use right it might

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.490 
being dice you can use right it might
make<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.519> easier<00:04:19.669> my<00:04:20.449> sharpest<00:04:20.900> one<00:04:21.049> was<00:04:21.289> my

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
make it easier my sharpest one was my

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.800 
make it easier my sharpest one was my
chef's<00:04:21.919> knife<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:22.849> that's<00:04:23.060> why<00:04:23.270> I'm<00:04:23.360> using<00:04:23.510> it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
chef's knife so that's why I'm using it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.589 
chef's knife so that's why I'm using it
like<00:04:23.960> this<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.410> I'm<00:04:24.889> going<00:04:24.919> around<00:04:25.430> trying<00:04:26.389> to

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
like this and I'm going around trying to

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.960 
like this and I'm going around trying to
keep<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.380> middle<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.460> will<00:04:28.789> have

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
keep it in the middle so I will have

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.080 
keep it in the middle so I will have
even

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
even

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.740 
even
years<00:04:30.419> for<00:04:30.720> my<00:04:30.900> vodka<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:35.639> this<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.480> how<00:04:36.630> it

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
years for my vodka and this is how it

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.320 
years for my vodka and this is how it
looks<00:04:36.960> like<00:04:37.080> when<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:37.590> done<00:04:37.940> then<00:04:38.940> I'm<00:04:39.090> going

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
looks like when it's done then I'm going

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.390 
looks like when it's done then I'm going
to<00:04:39.449> prepare<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.810> gelatin<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:40.740> I'm<00:04:40.949> adding<00:04:41.280> my

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
to prepare my gelatin so I'm adding my

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.780 
to prepare my gelatin so I'm adding my
gelatine<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.440> water<00:04:43.440> make<00:04:44.280> sure<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.639> it's

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
gelatine and water make sure that it's

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.740 
gelatine and water make sure that it's
not<00:04:44.910> hot<00:04:45.240> water<00:04:45.270> it's<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.280> warm<00:04:47.280> water<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.970> stir

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
not hot water it's a warm water you stir

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.750 
not hot water it's a warm water you stir
it<00:04:48.870> until<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.320> dissolved<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.040> then<00:04:50.430> put<00:04:50.669> it

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
it until it's dissolved and then put it

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.730 
it until it's dissolved and then put it
aside<00:04:50.910> so<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.510> cools<00:04:51.690> down<00:04:51.870> before<00:04:52.020> we<00:04:52.530> going

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
aside so it cools down before we going

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.469 
aside so it cools down before we going
to<00:04:52.860> be<00:04:52.979> adding<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.340> into<00:04:53.639> our<00:04:53.820> whipped<00:04:54.180> cream

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
to be adding it into our whipped cream

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.840 
to be adding it into our whipped cream
and<00:04:54.990> then<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.220> put<00:04:56.699> my<00:04:57.680> baking<00:04:58.680> pan<00:04:58.710> line<00:04:59.669> it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
and then I put my baking pan line it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.150 
and then I put my baking pan line it
with<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.150> parchment<00:05:00.870> paper<00:05:00.900> again<00:05:01.470> put<00:05:01.830> half

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
with the parchment paper again put half

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.129 
with the parchment paper again put half
of<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.490> cake<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:03.000> then<00:05:03.240> soak<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:03.870> my

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
of the cake and then soak it with my

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.150 
of the cake and then soak it with my
syrup<00:05:04.530> make<00:05:05.250> sure<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.610> soak<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.120> well<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:07.160> you

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
syrup make sure you soak it well and you

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.800 
syrup make sure you soak it well and you
use<00:05:08.340> half<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.000> syrup<00:05:09.300> because<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.660> other

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
use half of the syrup because the other

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.320 
use half of the syrup because the other
half<00:05:10.020> will<00:05:10.260> go<00:05:10.440> for<00:05:10.680> our<00:05:10.800> top<00:05:11.130> then<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:12.090> have<00:05:12.300> a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
half will go for our top then I have a

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.040 
half will go for our top then I have a
coal<00:05:13.290> cold<00:05:14.250> heavy<00:05:14.639> cream<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:15.300> add<00:05:15.570> my<00:05:15.810> vanilla

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
coal cold heavy cream I add my vanilla

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.070 
coal cold heavy cream I add my vanilla
and<00:05:16.940> icing<00:05:17.940> sugar<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.479> I'm<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.990> be

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
and icing sugar and I'm going to be

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.620 
and icing sugar and I'm going to be
beating<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.560> until<00:05:19.880> soft<00:05:20.880> peaks<00:05:21.000> right<00:05:21.450> now

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
beating it until soft peaks right now

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.159 
beating it until soft peaks right now
and<00:05:22.229> then<00:05:23.039> when<00:05:23.700> we<00:05:23.820> reach<00:05:23.970> soft<00:05:24.300> peaks<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.870> have

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
and then when we reach soft peaks I have

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.300 
and then when we reach soft peaks I have
my<00:05:26.150> gelatin<00:05:27.150> mix<00:05:27.560> cool<00:05:28.560> down<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.070> I'm<00:05:29.130> going

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
my gelatin mix cool down and I'm going

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.480 
my gelatin mix cool down and I'm going
to<00:05:29.550> be<00:05:29.639> adding<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.360> slowly<00:05:30.870> mixing<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.710> and

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
to be adding it and slowly mixing it and

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.790 
to be adding it and slowly mixing it and
then<00:05:32.669> beating<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.180> some<00:05:33.419> more<00:05:33.630> until<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.530> reach

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
then beating it some more until I reach

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.279 
then beating it some more until I reach
stiff<00:05:35.460> peaks<00:05:35.760> now<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.060> can<00:05:36.419> skip<00:05:37.110> the

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
stiff peaks now you can skip the

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.930 
stiff peaks now you can skip the
gelatine<00:05:37.710> if<00:05:37.889> you<00:05:38.010> would<00:05:38.130> like<00:05:38.310> it's<00:05:38.610> going<00:05:38.880> to

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
gelatine if you would like it's going to

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.909 
gelatine if you would like it's going to
be<00:05:39.120> much<00:05:39.330> harder<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.900> cut<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.289> cake<00:05:40.530> dough<00:05:40.770> at

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
be much harder to cut the cake dough at

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.550 
be much harder to cut the cake dough at
the<00:05:41.100> end<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:41.760> can<00:05:41.940> also<00:05:42.120> add<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.840> whipping

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
the end you can also add the whipping

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.029 
the end you can also add the whipping
cream<00:05:43.590> fix<00:05:44.630> that<00:05:45.630> can<00:05:45.930> work<00:05:46.139> as<00:05:46.320> well<00:05:46.560> so<00:05:46.590> just

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
cream fix that can work as well so just

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.820 
cream fix that can work as well so just
according<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.729> packaging<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.539> the<00:05:49.110> figs

melting it in the microwave I'm putting

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.310 
melting it in the microwave I'm putting
it<00:06:23.340> 30<00:06:23.669> seconds<00:06:24.450> at<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.690> time<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.169> then

poking<00:06:25.770> it<00:06:25.919> with<00:06:26.099> my<00:06:26.690> whisk<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:28.020> find<00:06:28.289> out<00:06:28.470> if

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
poking it with my whisk to find out if

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.219 
poking it with my whisk to find out if
it's<00:06:29.310> melted<00:06:29.669> enough<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:30.270> when<00:06:30.900> it<00:06:31.020> looks

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
it's melted enough and when it looks

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.760 
it's melted enough and when it looks
like<00:06:31.470> this<00:06:31.620> that<00:06:32.039> means<00:06:32.340> it's<00:06:32.639> ready

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
like this that means it's ready

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.010 
like this that means it's ready
so<00:06:34.340> we're<00:06:34.580> going<00:06:34.729> to<00:06:34.849> spread<00:06:35.270> it<00:06:35.389> on<00:06:35.630> top<00:06:35.990> of

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
so we're going to spread it on top of

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.860 
so we're going to spread it on top of
our<00:06:36.229> cake<00:06:36.650> and<00:06:37.069> I<00:06:37.550> use<00:06:37.699> my<00:06:37.910> nice<00:06:38.090> spatula<00:06:38.479> and
