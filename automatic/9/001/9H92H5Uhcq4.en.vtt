and<00:03:21.459> well<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.840> think<00:03:22.870> it'll<00:03:23.169> be<00:03:23.200> around<00:03:23.470> for

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.940 
and well and I think it'll be around for
long<00:03:23.739> even<00:03:24.639> longer<00:03:24.849> than<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.870> mean<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.590> ufc's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
long even longer than I mean the ufc's

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.009 
long even longer than I mean the ufc's

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
to just wrestling beat the hell out of

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.150 
to just wrestling beat the hell out of
each<00:03:31.060> other<00:03:31.239> for<00:03:31.569> fun<00:03:31.720> now<00:03:32.620> they<00:03:32.739> just<00:03:32.950> put<00:03:33.099> it
