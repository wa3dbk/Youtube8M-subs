to<00:01:47.070> maneuver<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.579> around<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.299> teeth<00:01:48.540> once

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to maneuver that around the teeth once

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.490 
to maneuver that around the teeth once
we<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.170> those<00:01:49.350> positioned<00:01:50.149> realistically<00:01:51.500> so

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
we get those positioned realistically so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.760 
we get those positioned realistically so
we<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.450> press<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.689> tongue<00:01:54.990> very

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
we want to press the tongue very

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.990
