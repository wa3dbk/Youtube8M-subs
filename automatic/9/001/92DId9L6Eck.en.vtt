your video it's great your Ollie was
good<00:00:47.650> frontside<00:00:48.650> 180<00:00:48.980> could<00:00:49.280> use<00:00:49.400> a<00:00:49.430> little

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
good frontside 180 could use a little

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.970 
good frontside 180 could use a little
bit<00:00:50.060> of<00:00:50.090> work<00:00:50.390> but<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.230> can<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:51.650> probably

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
bit of work but you can you probably

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.940 
bit of work but you can you probably
have<00:00:52.130> better<00:00:52.310> ones<00:00:52.870> shoves<00:00:53.870> find<00:00:54.290> friendship

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
have better ones shoves find friendship

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.080 
have better ones shoves find friendship
fine<00:00:56.980> kickflip<00:00:58.420> I<00:00:59.420> think<00:01:00.850> sometimes<00:01:01.850> when<00:01:01.970> i

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
fine kickflip I think sometimes when i

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.380 
fine kickflip I think sometimes when i
do<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:02.330> pop<00:01:02.510> coming<00:01:02.809> online<00:01:03.140> sorta<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:03.890> joint

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
do the pop coming online sorta in joint

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.180 
do the pop coming online sorta in joint
and<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.570> probably<00:01:05.990> be<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.260> problem<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.070> off

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
and that probably be a problem on it off

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.870 
and that probably be a problem on it off
and<00:01:07.940> also<00:01:08.300> my<00:01:08.479> kick<00:01:08.720> flips<00:01:08.990> if<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:10.729> you

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
and also my kick flips if you if you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.310 
and also my kick flips if you if you
don't<00:01:11.060> notice<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.780> would<00:01:11.900> sorting<00:01:12.229> line

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
don't notice like I would sorting line

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.830 
don't notice like I would sorting line
in<00:01:12.530> front<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.920> nose<00:01:13.160> I<00:01:13.520> just<00:01:14.450> can't<00:01:14.600> seem

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
in front of the nose I just can't seem

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.680 
in front of the nose I just can't seem
to<00:01:14.930> get<00:01:15.020> those<00:01:15.200> problems<00:01:15.560> down<00:01:15.710> either<00:01:15.890> so

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
to get those problems down either so

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.749 
to get those problems down either so
yeah<00:01:17.690> here<00:01:18.650> my<00:01:21.040> cool<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.070> lot<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.520> problems

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
yeah here my cool a lot of the problems

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
when you're landing too far forward is

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.540 
when you're landing too far forward is
the<00:01:26.119> way<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.690> you're<00:01:26.990> you're<00:01:27.530> setting<00:01:28.340> up

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
the way that you're you're setting up

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.390 
the way that you're you're setting up
when<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.970> take<00:01:29.300> off<00:01:29.509> I'll<00:01:30.470> do<00:01:30.650> one<00:01:30.830> with<00:01:31.040> speed

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
is a really good way to practice what

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.060 
is a really good way to practice what
you're<00:02:04.570> saying<00:02:04.870> is<00:02:05.020> step<00:02:05.200> off<00:02:05.350> your<00:02:05.560> back<00:02:05.770> foot

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
you're saying is step off your back foot

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.260 
you're saying is step off your back foot
cool<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:06.970> let's<00:02:07.000> see<00:02:07.330> where<00:02:07.480> we're<00:02:07.630> at<00:02:07.750> here

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
cool so let's see where we're at here

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.400 
cool so let's see where we're at here
again<00:02:10.270> just<00:02:10.570> like<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.840> said<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.230> was<00:02:11.380> a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
again just like you said it was a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.160 
again just like you said it was a
problem<00:02:11.860> on<00:02:12.010> both<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.760> pop<00:02:13.000> shove-it<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
problem on both the pop shove-it and the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.840 
problem on both the pop shove-it and the
kickflip<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:15.190> you're<00:02:15.370> saying<00:02:15.700> you're

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
kickflip just like you're saying you're

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.010 
kickflip just like you're saying you're
leaning<00:02:15.970> too<00:02:16.330> far<00:02:16.360> forward<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.850> would<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.840> I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
leaning too far forward so I would if I

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.530 
leaning too far forward so I would if I
were<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.290> take<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.800> back<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.820> pop<00:02:22.210> shuvit

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
were you take it back to the pop shuvit

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
were you take it back to the pop shuvit
and<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.990> kickflip<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:24.190> used<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.550> doing

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and the kickflip and get used to doing

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.050 
and the kickflip and get used to doing
both<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.210> those<00:02:25.360> while<00:02:25.900> leaning<00:02:26.320> back<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
both of those while leaning back so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.480 
both of those while leaning back so
there's<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:28.780> sequence<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.860> tricks<00:02:30.250> this

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
there's this sequence of tricks this

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.430 
there's this sequence of tricks this
progression<00:02:30.970> which<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.450> did<00:02:31.660> follow<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.380> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
progression which you did follow and I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.590 
progression which you did follow and I
do<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.800> say<00:02:32.860> well<00:02:33.220> done<00:02:33.459> for<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.940> riding

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
do want to say well done for that riding

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.930

pop show French of he'll flip kickflip
but<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> exact<00:02:40.450> reason<00:02:40.570> why<00:02:40.900> made

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
but this is the exact reason why made

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.990 
but this is the exact reason why made
this<00:02:41.890> sequence<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:43.240> because<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:43.900> you're<00:02:44.380> not

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
this sequence it's because if you're not

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.820 
this sequence it's because if you're not
perfect<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.450> one<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.780> those<00:02:46.930> earlier<00:02:47.380> steps

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
perfect on one of those earlier steps

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.370 
perfect on one of those earlier steps
then<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.610> try<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.880> add<00:02:49.120> two<00:02:49.420> together<00:02:49.600> like<00:02:50.200> in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
then you try to add two together like in

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.440 
then you try to add two together like in
the<00:02:50.410> varial<00:02:50.890> flip<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.970> becomes<00:02:52.239> really

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the varial flip and it becomes really

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
the varial flip and it becomes really
difficult<00:02:52.570> because<00:02:53.320> you're<00:02:53.650> already<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
difficult because you're already a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.250 
difficult because you're already a
little<00:02:54.910> bit<00:02:55.060> shaky<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:55.780> pop<00:02:55.959> shuvit

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
little bit shaky on your pop shuvit

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.960 
little bit shaky on your pop shuvit
because<00:02:56.709> you're<00:02:56.860> landing<00:02:57.040> too<00:02:57.340> far<00:02:57.580> forward

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
because you're landing too far forward

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.420 
because you're landing too far forward
on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.300> nose<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:59.650> little<00:02:59.920> bit<00:03:00.010> shaky<00:03:00.400> on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
on the nose and a little bit shaky on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
on the nose and a little bit shaky on
the<00:03:00.550> kickflip<00:03:01.030> same<00:03:01.480> reason<00:03:02.020> because<00:03:02.440> you're

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
the kickflip same reason because you're

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.990 
the kickflip same reason because you're
leaning<00:03:02.830> too<00:03:02.950> far<00:03:02.980> forward<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.610> nose<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
leaning too far forward on the nose so

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.030 
leaning too far forward on the nose so
when<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.570> put<00:03:04.780> both<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:04.989> those<00:03:05.200> together<00:03:05.410> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
when you put both of those together and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.650 
when you put both of those together and
do<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> varial<00:03:06.730> flip<00:03:06.760> your<00:03:07.150> rent<00:03:07.450> your

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
do the varial flip your rent your

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.259 
do the varial flip your rent your
landing<00:03:08.019> way<00:03:08.260> too<00:03:08.320> far<00:03:08.830> forward<00:03:09.190> too<00:03:10.030> far

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
landing way too far forward too far

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.110 
landing way too far forward too far
forward<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.720> can't<00:03:10.989> land<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:12.010> yeah<00:03:12.700> like

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
forward that you can't land so yeah like

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.420 
forward that you can't land so yeah like
I<00:03:13.269> said<00:03:13.510> take<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.320> back<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.830> those<00:03:14.980> previous

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
I said take it back to those previous

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.430 
I said take it back to those previous
tricks<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.910> practice<00:03:16.330> doing<00:03:16.900> those<00:03:17.140> and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
tricks and practice doing those and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.080 
tricks and practice doing those and
shoving<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.950> board<00:03:18.190> more<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.760> front<00:03:18.970> of

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
shoving the board more out in front of

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.240 
shoving the board more out in front of
you<00:03:19.239> now<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.930> way<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.410> do<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.830> on

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
you now the way that you do that is on

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.250 
you now the way that you do that is on
the<00:03:21.310> take<00:03:21.730> off<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.330> have<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.690> be<00:03:23.489> leaning<00:03:24.489> back

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
the take off you have to be leaning back

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.009 
the take off you have to be leaning back
you<00:03:26.260> can't<00:03:26.560> lean<00:03:26.709> back<00:03:26.950> too<00:03:27.220> far<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:28.900> get

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
you can't lean back too far but just get

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.810 
you can't lean back too far but just get
the<00:03:29.140> idea<00:03:29.470> if<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.739> wanted<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.100> kick<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.580> board

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
the idea if you wanted to kick the board

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.970 
the idea if you wanted to kick the board
out<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.120> front<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:32.230> would<00:03:32.350> lean<00:03:32.620> back

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
out in front of you you would lean back

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.160 
out in front of you you would lean back
and<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.580> as<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.820> popped<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.600> would<00:03:34.720> push<00:03:34.989> it

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
and then as you popped you would push it

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.350 
and then as you popped you would push it
forward<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.310> that's<00:03:36.519> what<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.730> have<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:37.209> on

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
forward so that's what you have to do on

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.930 
forward so that's what you have to do on
both<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.989> pop<00:03:38.230> shuvit<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.160> kickflip<00:03:39.700> and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
both the pop shuvit and the kickflip and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.000 
both the pop shuvit and the kickflip and
I<00:03:40.450> would<00:03:40.630> get<00:03:40.810> really<00:03:40.959> good<00:03:41.200> at<00:03:41.260> pushing<00:03:41.739> it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
I would get really good at pushing it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.729 
I would get really good at pushing it
forward<00:03:42.310> on<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.959> pop<00:03:44.200> shove<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.590> and

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
forward on just the pop shove it and

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.009 
forward on just the pop shove it and
just<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.400> kickflip<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.030> then<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> would

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
just the kickflip and then I would

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.130 
just the kickflip and then I would
practice<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.430> varial<00:03:48.850> flip<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.870> like

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
practice it with the varial flip so like

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.650 
practice it with the varial flip so like
I<00:03:50.290> said<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.709> would<00:03:50.830> be<00:03:50.980> great<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.820> have<00:03:52.299> you

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
I said it would be great to have you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.920 
I said it would be great to have you
stepping<00:03:53.650> off<00:03:53.799> with<00:03:53.950> your<00:03:54.100> back<00:03:54.310> foot

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
stepping off with your back foot

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.539 
stepping off with your back foot
flipping<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.080> shoving<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.799> out<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.220> front<00:03:57.459> of

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
flipping it shoving it out in front of

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.580 
flipping it shoving it out in front of
you<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:57.940> then<00:03:58.420> catching<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.049> with<00:03:59.140> your<00:03:59.320> front

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
you and then catching it with your front

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.890 
you and then catching it with your front
foot<00:03:59.680> on<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.670> varial<00:04:01.030> flip<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.360> do<00:04:01.630> catch<00:04:01.870> it

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
foot on the varial flip you do catch it

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.350 
foot on the varial flip you do catch it
with<00:04:02.110> your<00:04:02.140> front<00:04:02.530> foot<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.280> very<00:04:03.700> similar

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
with your front foot it is very similar

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.780 
with your front foot it is very similar
to<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.750> pop<00:04:05.080> shove-it<00:04:05.560> which<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:05.980> also<00:04:06.250> catch

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
to a pop shove-it which you also catch

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.420 
to a pop shove-it which you also catch
with<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.150> front<00:04:07.359> foot<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.380> yeah<00:04:08.590> feel<00:04:09.220> free

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
with your front foot so yeah feel free

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.300 
with your front foot so yeah feel free
to<00:04:09.669> pop<00:04:10.419> it<00:04:10.660> but<00:04:10.989> lean<00:04:11.230> back<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.799> back<00:04:11.980> seat

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
to pop it but lean back in the back seat

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.059 
to pop it but lean back in the back seat
eat<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.610> then<00:04:13.450> put<00:04:13.810> your<00:04:13.840> front<00:04:14.230> foot<00:04:14.319> forward

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520
