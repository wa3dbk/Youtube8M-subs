this<00:00:48.450> location<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:49.680> I've<00:00:49.770> done<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.280> I've

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
this location what I've done is I've

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.119 
this location what I've done is I've
taken<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.899> backing<00:00:52.410> plate<00:00:52.649> template

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
taken this this backing plate template

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.150 
taken this this backing plate template
and<00:00:53.670> used<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.570> determine<00:00:55.170> where<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> cut<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and used it to determine where to cut I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.729 
and used it to determine where to cut I
had<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> grind<00:00:56.640> down<00:00:56.910> all<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.170> area<00:00:58.410> flat

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
had to grind down all of this area flat

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.479 
had to grind down all of this area flat
to<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> plate<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.760> fit<00:01:00.480> flush<00:01:00.829> then<00:01:01.829> I'm

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
to get the plate to fit flush then I'm

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.139 
to get the plate to fit flush then I'm
going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> use<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:04.369> piece<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> soft<00:01:05.700> wood<00:01:05.910> as<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
going to use a piece of soft wood as a

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.690 
going to use a piece of soft wood as a
backer<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.160> clamp<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
backer and then I'm going to clamp this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.469 
backer and then I'm going to clamp this
guy<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> place<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.920> will<00:01:14.190> drill<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.210> first

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
guy in place and I will drill my first

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:43.020 
guy in place and I will drill my first
hole<00:01:17.060> using<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> 1/2<00:01:18.300> inch<00:01:18.479> bit

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.209 

and<00:01:44.030> now<00:01:44.179> what<00:01:44.360> I'll<00:01:44.479> do<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.799> fill<00:01:45.799> this<00:01:45.950> clamp

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
and now what I'll do is fill this clamp

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.990

the<00:03:20.200> pressure<00:03:21.200> gauge<00:03:21.440> off

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.830 

this<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.189> the<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.549> orientation<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.599> I'm<00:03:33.659> going

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
this is the up orientation and I'm going

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.530 
this is the up orientation and I'm going
to<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.319> pressure<00:03:34.650> gauge<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.040> top<00:03:35.540> so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
to have the pressure gauge on top so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.800 
to have the pressure gauge on top so
this<00:03:37.790> backing<00:03:38.790> plate<00:03:39.150> needs<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.420> be<00:03:39.569> turned

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
this backing plate needs to be turned

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.629 
this backing plate needs to be turned
around<00:03:41.359> you're<00:03:42.359> gonna<00:03:46.219> you<00:03:47.219> need<00:03:47.400> to

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
around you're gonna you need to

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.640 
around you're gonna you need to
determine<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> correct<00:03:48.599> orientation<00:03:48.870> for

determine the correct orientation for

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.809 
determine the correct orientation for
this<00:03:50.450> pressure<00:03:51.450> gage<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.459> try<00:03:53.670> and

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
this pressure gage and you can try and

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.879 
this pressure gage and you can try and
in<00:03:54.090> different<00:03:54.540> places<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.439> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.709> that

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
in different places you can see that

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.020 
in different places you can see that
that<00:03:56.010> doesn't<00:03:56.400> quite<00:03:56.609> line<00:03:56.879> up<00:03:56.909> square<00:03:59.030> what

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
that doesn't quite line up square what

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.369 
that doesn't quite line up square what
you<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.269> do<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:00.659> turn<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.109> plate

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
you can do is you can turn this plate

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.159 
you can do is you can turn this plate
over<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:02.060> there<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.209> fits<00:04:03.359> perfectly<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:03.959> it

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
over and there it fits perfectly so it

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.009 
over and there it fits perfectly so it
all<00:04:04.290> depends<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:05.209> these<00:04:06.209> pressure<00:04:06.540> gages<00:04:06.930> are

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
all depends on these pressure gages are

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.349 
all depends on these pressure gages are
all<00:04:07.139> different<00:04:07.439> so<00:04:07.889> just<00:04:08.220> try<00:04:08.519> whichever<00:04:08.909> way

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
all different so just try whichever way

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.780 
all different so just try whichever way
fits<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:09.810> best<00:04:10.010> then<00:04:11.010> we<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.370> which<00:04:11.549> way<00:04:11.700> our

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
fits the best then we know which way our

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.929 
fits the best then we know which way our
backing<00:04:12.180> plate<00:04:12.359> goes<00:04:12.569> on<00:04:13.700> go<00:04:14.700> ahead<00:04:14.760> and
