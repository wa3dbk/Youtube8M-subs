practice we've had many patients who are

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
practice we've had many patients who are
leading<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.980> healthy<00:00:59.250> lifestyle<00:00:59.699> they

leading a healthy lifestyle they
exercise<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.590> eat<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.059> may<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
exercise they eat well but they may be

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
exercise they eat well but they may be
just<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.660> little<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.899> too<00:01:04.350> busy<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.890> work<00:01:05.070> out

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
just a little bit too busy to work out

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
just a little bit too busy to work out
as<00:01:05.400> much<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.580> they'd<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
as much as they'd like and they want to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.340 
as much as they'd like and they want to
treat<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:07.950> areas<00:01:08.280> without<00:01:08.430> surgery<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
treat these areas without surgery and so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.660 
treat these areas without surgery and so
this<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> solution<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.310> them

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this will be the solution for them

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.780 
this will be the solution for them
technology<00:01:12.420> works<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:13.290> RF<00:01:14.070> energy<00:01:14.310> which

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
technology works using RF energy which

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.460 
technology works using RF energy which
is<00:01:14.970> basically<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.689> form<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.049> electricity

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
is basically a form of electricity

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.999 
is basically a form of electricity
that's<00:01:17.119> safely<00:01:18.119> applied<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> skin<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that's safely applied to the skin and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.340 
that's safely applied to the skin and
each<00:01:20.909> area<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.330> heated<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:22.049> four

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
each area is heated for about four

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
each area is heated for about four
minutes<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.490> natural<00:01:23.970> heating<00:01:24.210> process

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
minutes and this natural heating process

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.590 
minutes and this natural heating process
will<00:01:25.110> cause<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> fat<00:01:26.369> cells<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.880> undergo<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
will cause the fat cells to undergo a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.640 
will cause the fat cells to undergo a
very<00:01:28.290> gradual<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> slow<00:01:29.520> natural<00:01:30.030> cell<00:01:30.299> death

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
very gradual and slow natural cell death

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.450 
very gradual and slow natural cell death
eliminating<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.770> over<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> period<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.400> weeks

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
eliminating them over a period of weeks

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
eliminating them over a period of weeks
for<00:01:33.329> our<00:01:33.450> patients<00:01:33.720> who<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.020> interested<00:01:34.560> in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
piece for the triskele device that has

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.969 
piece for the triskele device that has
an<00:04:24.669> electrode<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.539> transfers<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.680> RF

energy<00:04:27.160> into<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:27.910> skin<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.770> so<00:04:29.770> we<00:04:29.949> make<00:04:30.100> sure

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
energy into the skin and so we make sure

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.540 
energy into the skin and so we make sure
the<00:04:30.400> machine<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.699> ready<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:33.070> lay<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.400> on
