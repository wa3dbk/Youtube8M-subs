00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
past coverage we again showed that we

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.490 
past coverage we again showed that we
can<00:02:00.160> be<00:02:00.370> all<00:02:00.700> over<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:01.210> ball<00:02:01.479> when<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.110> need<00:02:02.470> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
can be all over the ball when we need to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.219 
can be all over the ball when we need to
and<00:02:03.160> that<00:02:03.370> that's<00:02:03.700> pretty<00:02:04.150> evident<00:02:04.360> those<00:02:04.990> are

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
and that that's pretty evident those are

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.500 
and that that's pretty evident those are
really<00:02:05.470> big<00:02:05.860> things<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.910> be<00:02:07.030> able<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.300> close

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
really big things to be able to close

really big things to be able to close
teams<00:02:07.900> down<00:02:08.200> when<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:09.130> they've<00:02:09.340> gotta

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
teams down when you know they've gotta

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550
