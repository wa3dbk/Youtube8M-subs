00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
but this last game and the fact that I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.069 
but this last game and the fact that I
did<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:49.890> only<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.909> lose<00:01:51.119> made<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.930> very

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
did so well only to lose made me very

frustrated I also came to the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.080 
frustrated I also came to the
realization<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> while<00:01:55.890> mw3<00:01:56.369> may<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.820> bad

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
realization that while mw3 may be a bad
game<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.740> entirely<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> game's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
game maybe it's not entirely the game's
