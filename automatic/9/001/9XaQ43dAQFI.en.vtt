00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.650
 Ah 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.690
 to 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.990
 Hi, I find He clearly see images Mont Ferraro's what it's doors 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:24.460
 I do not know if it's a combination . 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.570
 Olbi billion've Depp media is almost Maine's Gulliver and 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.439
 Well , you've been doing a lot of YouTube stuff these days. 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.280
 Those who have been looking for a lot of the same thing, 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:40.420
 The intersection does not cover the outermost building. 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.559
 I 'll beat the mobile tower, but it's very much like this cannon . 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.210
 Because 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.950
 That's why it's not right. 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.420
 Remove site building 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.960
 There's a battle. When the golem just disappears, if you give it a jump, it will advance to the middle. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.400
 Put the finishing punishment Golem put anti-aircraft guns removed, and then 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.530
 So it starts with balloons and ends with a shot. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.759
 I'll show you a video without a long description . 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.450
 I think I'm going to allocate almost every cancer now . 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.080
 Once you see it, you can make a profit if you assign it here. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 He's bombed two of them at first, so it's more stable. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:25.390
 If you know, I will not have a third term limit. 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:28.960
 Anyway , if you hit a good one, you'll end up suffering self-destruct damage. 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:34.799
 That's why I see it. 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.799
 We almost died, but we still do damage. 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.990
 It's all gone. It's done. 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.520
 Rather than collecting units, now go after the golem , 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.729
 To give you a little iron. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.939
 For haetguyo did little to pull the dew on the outskirts of finished road 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.939
 To go to both sides to pull out to the outermost group 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.829
 Just because one is very Archer dies of a bank earned some trees I follow 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.550
 It united me now pretty easy to get organized with the Judiciary 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.280
 So I'm just saying that to get into Verlander Sunkist right sseojugo 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.370
 I used to stay in store spells, so I drilled it too early. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.480
 So as much as possible 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.960
 Yes , I will hear from the back until well organized, then send me the golem first. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.280
 Behind the witch witch English follow me 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.400
 Hey, because there are two days what do no fit perfectly Golem Vertigo 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.580
 Archer King This baba king is good at Archer Keen. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 Judiciary not vividly alive creation of living and be 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.170
 Now, if you go to the intersection, 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.170
 It's still alive. 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.030
 Hi-cut , I got rid of the big bomb. 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 Because Im's over now when the industry came out by removing the script Koman 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.560
 Yes, I would like to put more examples in the bang, 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.240
 Is there a beggar ? 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.740
 4 I put it in there. 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.740
 So turn to lift 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.880
 So it's pretty neat. 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:20.100
 Please read this section once these images you have entered above now do the targeting 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:24.240
 It's a very easy map, 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.860
 If it's a pure stream or something, then it's all coming in 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.900
 Is secretly demanding maps is why these things should I know who 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.380
 You know a lot, but yes. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 Have you started to increase punishment for those who do not know for example that ends with balloon 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.810
 23 highs high tide mainboard jermaine troop gorun what kind of fear is too much 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.890
 I showed you the center. 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.860
 Why tabernacle, and why almost anything else in the camp that I can not cut off the connection seonhae 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.730
 Some anti-aircraft guns in a show like this when dealing 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.760
 Gimjeong Gimlem counter to the center and finish the main point 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.420
