00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:09.649
 I am a singer and composer 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.649
 poetry 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.750
 but if I should choose what 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.670
 Otherwise it would be the same for everyone 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.380
 fall lions there hear acrobats wizard 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.380
 Dancer and an Indian girl 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.720
 my songs are i would say 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.870
 modern fairy tale with the slope to 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.870
 nostalgia 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.650
 the thought co 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 stories that play on fairs 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.340
 or 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.200
 about one-armed hunchback I write 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.560
 totally like outsiders 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.550
 as marc outsider maybe 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.900
 maybe with the message behind it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.339
 that only that which lies in the hidden lies 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.620
 What you do not see at first 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.000
 Immediately realize that that really 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.520
 especially for three years I have 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.430
 now a wonderful band on my side 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.560
 she is the poorer one , so to speak 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.810
 heart which lives the songs 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.690
 there we have christian with 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.940
 its too big a drum felix 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.580
 trumpets simon who also plays the squeeze 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.149
 and our real russian evgeny 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.420
 from Kazakhstan 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.100
 what really wants 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.680
 the freedom end 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 which drawer our musician me 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.860
 Of course, no one would say that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.159
 there is always jazz and swing under all 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.350
 and a lot of blues and we like polka and 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.640
 dance music 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.799
 but for me i can say that is 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.979
 totally lost my heart in stress-son 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.780
 has and what it really important is 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.920
 that is that the music is in german 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.189
 I sing in german 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.080
 this is the authentic feel of 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.560
 for me and actually gives me one 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.560
 home feeling 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.420
