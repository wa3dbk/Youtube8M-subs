00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
you know the Maldives has always

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
you know the Maldives has always
advocated<00:00:26.960> steps<00:00:28.220> towards<00:00:29.220> minimizing<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
effects of climate change and global

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.100 
effects of climate change and global
warming<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.640> low-lying<00:00:33.360> countries<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
warming on low-lying countries of the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.500 
warming on low-lying countries of the
world<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.640> nations<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
world as well as other nations that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.479 
world as well as other nations that
would<00:00:36.780> suffer<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.590> result<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.250> climate

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
would suffer as a result of climate

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
would suffer as a result of climate
change<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.989> has<00:00:40.230> come<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
change and I think this has come as a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
change and I think this has come as a
very<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:42.410> decision<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.370> very<00:00:44.520> happy

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
very good decision we are very happy

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
very good decision we are very happy
with<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> decision<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> Human<00:00:46.079> Rights

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
with the decision of the Human Rights

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
with the decision of the Human Rights
Council<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:48.140> request<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:50.420> secretary-general

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
Council to request the secretary-general

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
Council to request the secretary-general
to<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.890> conduct<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.850> study<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:55.940> detail

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to to conduct a study to detail

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
to to conduct a study to detail
analytical<00:00:57.629> study<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> relationship

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
analytical study on the relationship

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.349 
analytical study on the relationship
between<00:00:58.890> climate<00:00:59.879> change<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.510> human<00:01:00.930> rights

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
between climate change and human rights

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
between climate change and human rights
yes<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.229> practical<00:01:05.070> difference

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
yes so it's not practical difference

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
yes so it's not practical difference
with<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:08.340> will

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
with this actually make to you it will

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
with this actually make to you it will
indeed<00:01:08.909> make<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> difference<00:01:10.229> because

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
indeed make a lot of difference because

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
indeed make a lot of difference because
you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.810> inhabitants<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> very

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you know we are inhabitants of a very

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
you know we are inhabitants of a very
low-lying<00:01:13.830> country<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> world<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.270> mall

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
low-lying country in the world the mall

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
low-lying country in the world the mall
is<00:01:15.659> our<00:01:16.170> main<00:01:17.390> land

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
is our main land

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.350 
is our main land
you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.930> Rises<00:01:19.470> only<00:01:19.710> about<00:01:19.970> three<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> four

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you know Rises only about three to four

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.020 
you know Rises only about three to four
feet<00:01:21.540> above<00:01:21.810> mean<00:01:22.080> sea<00:01:22.110> level<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.759> case<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
feet above mean sea level so in case of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.289 
feet above mean sea level so in case of
any<00:01:24.570> global<00:01:25.130> climate<00:01:26.130> change<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.700> sea<00:01:26.970> level

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
any global climate change and sea level

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
any global climate change and sea level
rise<00:01:27.350> our<00:01:28.350> people<00:01:28.799> who<00:01:28.890> suffer<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> great<00:01:29.400> deal

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
rise our people who suffer a great deal

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.679 
rise our people who suffer a great deal
so<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.600> human<00:01:31.470> rights<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.890> linked<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so if human rights are linked to the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
so if human rights are linked to the
environment<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> sense<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.130> safe

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
environment in the sense that a safe

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
environment in the sense that a safe
environment<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> fundamental<00:01:37.350> human<00:01:37.380> right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
environment is a fundamental human right

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.319 
environment is a fundamental human right
then<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.990> focus<00:01:40.759> can<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.790> made

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then I think a lot of focus can be made

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.590 
then I think a lot of focus can be made
on<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.200> issue<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.000> people<00:01:45.000> around<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
on this issue and people around the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
on this issue and people around the
world<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.439> aware<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.100> situation<00:01:47.280> one

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
world will be aware of the situation one

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
world will be aware of the situation one
of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> problems<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> will<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.799> faced<00:01:50.009> by

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
of the problems that will be faced by

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.830 
of the problems that will be faced by
low-lying<00:01:50.640> countries<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> regions<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
low-lying countries and regions of the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679 
low-lying countries and regions of the
world<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.310> could<00:01:53.490> work<00:01:53.880> towards

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
world and I think we could work towards

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
world and I think we could work towards
finding<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.380> solution<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
finding a solution to that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.780 
finding a solution to that
so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.729> mean<00:01:56.939> would<00:01:57.149> raise<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.479> profile

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
so you mean would raise your profile

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.399 
so you mean would raise your profile
well<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.969> course<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.390> will<00:02:00.540> raise<00:02:00.719> our<00:02:00.840> profile

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
well of course it will raise our profile

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.370 
well of course it will raise our profile
and<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.950> course<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.490> alert<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.869> peoples

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and of course it will alert the peoples
