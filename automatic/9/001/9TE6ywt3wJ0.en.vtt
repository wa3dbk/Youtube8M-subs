00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280 
you play well and other teams play well
that's<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.070> nature<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.550> league<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.960> 93

that's the nature of the league it's 93
play<00:00:34.530> well<00:00:34.710> loose<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.250> mean<00:00:35.610> that's<00:00:35.960> something

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
play well loose I mean that's something

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.889 
play well loose I mean that's something
that<00:00:36.989> happens<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:38.450> when<00:00:39.450> you're<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that happens but when you're kind of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
that happens but when you're kind of
wasting<00:00:40.110> games<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.129> not

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
wasting games because you're not

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310

bringing<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:42.059> best<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> speak<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
bringing your best so to speak then I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
bringing your best so to speak then I
think<00:00:44.010> that's<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.969> frustrating<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.690> sure

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
think that's that's frustrating for sure

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
think that's that's frustrating for sure
so<00:00:46.250> there's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> combination<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> us<00:00:48.149> not

playing<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> having<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.370> bad<00:00:50.520> breaks

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
playing well and having some bad breaks

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.529 
playing well and having some bad breaks
with<00:00:51.180> injuries<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.260> had<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:54.059> wasn't<00:00:54.390> easy

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539

couple maybe or two or three in a row
and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> thought<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.810> were<00:01:21.899> playing<00:01:22.020> pretty

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

and I thought we were playing pretty
good<00:01:22.409> hockey<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:24.030> played<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
good hockey and then we played that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.840 
good hockey and then we played that
night<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.289> a<00:01:25.740> tough<00:01:26.250> night<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
night and it was just a tough night so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.779 
night and it was just a tough night so
yeah<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.890> an<00:01:28.979> easy<00:01:29.100> time<00:01:29.399> to

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
yeah it was it was not an easy time to

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.410 
yeah it was it was not an easy time to
think

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
think

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.020 
think
under<00:01:31.960> set<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.320> bench<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:33.549> laughter

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
under set on the bench and this laughter

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.700 
under set on the bench and this laughter
goal<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.420> Italy<00:01:34.720> has<00:01:34.869> pretty<00:01:35.200> hard<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> third

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
goal of Italy has pretty hard the third

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.760 
goal of Italy has pretty hard the third
so<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:37.119> was<00:01:37.270> definitely<00:01:37.689> tough<00:01:38.140> tough<00:01:38.560> want

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
so that was definitely tough tough want

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.460 
so that was definitely tough tough want

the day that you know if we're not

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.889 
the day that you know if we're not
playing<00:02:08.769> well<00:02:08.979> usually<00:02:09.489> it's<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.509> coach<00:02:10.720> that

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
playing well usually it's the coach that

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.490 
playing well usually it's the coach that
suffers<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:13.540> weren't<00:02:13.780> playing<00:02:13.959> well<00:02:14.260> we

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
suffers so we weren't playing well we

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.530 
suffers so we weren't playing well we
knew<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.100> we<00:02:15.430> felt<00:02:15.670> responsible<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.480> at

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
knew that and we felt responsible but at

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.430 
knew that and we felt responsible but at
the<00:02:16.630> same<00:02:16.840> time<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:19.450> knew<00:02:19.600> we<00:02:19.630> had<00:02:19.780> some<00:02:20.230> time

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
the same time we knew we had some time

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.309 
the same time we knew we had some time
left<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:21.040> had<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.250> make<00:02:21.400> sure<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:22.319> we

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
left and we had to make sure that we

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.870 
left and we had to make sure that we
found<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.680> way<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.860> turn<00:02:24.069> things<00:02:24.280> around<00:02:24.459> and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
found a way to turn things around and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.809 
found a way to turn things around and
whatever<00:02:25.360> changes<00:02:25.780> were<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.290> made

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
whatever changes were going to be made

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.890 
whatever changes were going to be made
they<00:02:27.819> could<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.030> made<00:02:28.209> but<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.480> was<00:02:28.600> up<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.840> us

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
they could be made but it was up to us

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.590 
they could be made but it was up to us
to<00:02:29.680> really<00:02:29.769> make<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.459> difference<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.510> were

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
to really make the difference you were

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.720 
to really make the difference you were
with<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> team<00:02:32.140> when<00:02:32.590> any<00:02:32.980> old<00:02:33.220> track<00:02:33.459> was

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
with the team when any old track was

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.309 
with the team when any old track was
dismissed<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.269> Michelle<00:02:34.569> terry<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.019> replaced

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
dismissed in Michelle terry and replaced

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.870 
dismissed in Michelle terry and replaced
him<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.709> weren't<00:02:35.859> captain<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.700> time

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
him but you weren't captain at that time

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.420 
him but you weren't captain at that time
being<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.810> captain<00:02:38.019> this<00:02:38.380> time<00:02:38.620> around<00:02:38.739> did<00:02:39.250> you

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
being a captain this time around did you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.780 
being a captain this time around did you
feel<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:40.000> sense<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.510> responsibility<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
feel a sense of responsibility to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.130 
feel a sense of responsibility to
address<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.060> team<00:02:43.269> or<00:02:43.570> do<00:02:43.989> things

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
address the team or do things

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.229 
address the team or do things
differently<00:02:44.590> since<00:02:44.890> your<00:02:45.100> role<00:02:45.250> as<00:02:45.519> captains

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
differently since your role as captains

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.780 
differently since your role as captains
is<00:02:46.420> obviously<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.260> role<00:02:47.530> leadership<00:02:48.040> yeah<00:02:48.760> I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
is obviously a role leadership yeah I

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.110 
is obviously a role leadership yeah I
mean<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:49.420> tough<00:02:50.109> you<00:02:50.769> know<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.579> a<00:02:51.609> captain

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
mean it's tough you know as a captain

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.110 
mean it's tough you know as a captain
your<00:02:52.900> job<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.950> know<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.070> think<00:02:54.340> always<00:02:54.579> remains

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
your job you know I think always remains

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
your job you know I think always remains
the<00:02:55.269> same<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:56.280> even<00:02:57.280> with<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> coaching<00:02:57.880> change

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the same and even with a coaching change

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.039 
the same and even with a coaching change
you<00:02:59.590> still<00:02:59.859> need<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.100> be<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.810> leader<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.959> the

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
you still need to be a leader in the

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.199 
you still need to be a leader in the
same<00:03:02.290> way<00:03:02.500> for<00:03:03.070> me<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.370> try<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.700> keep<00:03:03.940> doing

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
same way for me I just try to keep doing

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.180 
same way for me I just try to keep doing
the<00:03:04.299> same<00:03:04.329> thing<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.590> best<00:03:05.799> way<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.010> lead

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
the same thing and the best way to lead

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.280 
the same thing and the best way to lead
is<00:03:06.310> by<00:03:06.459> example<00:03:06.820> but<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.390> didn't<00:03:07.810> think<00:03:07.959> that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
is by example but I didn't think that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.410 
is by example but I didn't think that
there<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.160> needed<00:03:09.430> probably

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
there was really that needed probably

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.300 
there was really that needed probably
not<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> lot<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.780> would<00:03:11.049> be<00:03:11.200> said<00:03:11.410> guys

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
not a lot that would be said guys

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.130 
not a lot that would be said guys
realize<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.850> had<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.030> be<00:03:13.120> better<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.810> think

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
realize we had to be better and I think

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.170 
realize we had to be better and I think
every<00:03:14.590> guy<00:03:14.739> could<00:03:15.040> look<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.459> mirror<00:03:15.790> and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
every guy could look in the mirror and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.420 
every guy could look in the mirror and
be<00:03:16.480> honest<00:03:16.720> with<00:03:16.750> themselves<00:03:17.190> when<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.280> heard

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
be honest with themselves when you heard

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.699 
be honest with themselves when you heard
the<00:03:18.519> two<00:03:18.700> words<00:03:18.940> Dan<00:03:19.299> Bylsma<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:20.380> was<00:03:20.530> your

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the two words Dan Bylsma what was your

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.650 
the two words Dan Bylsma what was your
first<00:03:21.069> impression<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.390> did<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.540> think

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
first impression and what did you think

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.800 
first impression and what did you think
about<00:03:22.780> him<00:03:23.019> when<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.230> first<00:03:24.160> met<00:03:24.780> well<00:03:25.780> I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
about him when you first met well I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.750 
about him when you first met well I
really<00:03:26.170> didn't<00:03:26.380> know<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.500> lot<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.709> bottom<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.160> met

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
really didn't know a lot of bottom I met

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.680 
really didn't know a lot of bottom I met
him<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.389> at<00:03:28.540> camp<00:03:28.810> but

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
him I just at camp but

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.920 
him I just at camp but
well<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.560> think<00:03:30.650> first<00:03:30.860> impressions<00:03:31.670> were

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
well I think first impressions were

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.600 
well I think first impressions were
pretty<00:03:32.930> upbeat<00:03:33.260> person<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.040> know<00:03:34.130> he<00:03:34.310> came

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
pretty upbeat person you know he came

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.050 
pretty upbeat person you know he came

flood of energy than Rankin from what he

play<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:40.580> high<00:03:40.730> paced<00:03:41.030> game<00:03:41.150> skilled

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
play a really high paced game skilled

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.340 
play a really high paced game skilled
game<00:03:41.960> and<00:03:42.610> really<00:03:43.610> attacked<00:03:44.060> team<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:44.630> you

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
game and really attacked team so you

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.660 
game and really attacked team so you
know<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.500> was<00:03:45.620> now<00:03:45.770> offensive<00:03:46.160> player<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.580> was

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
know I was now offensive player that was

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.310 
know I was now offensive player that was
something<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.150> look<00:03:47.570> forward<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.960> you

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
something that I look forward to you

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.410 
something that I look forward to you
know<00:03:48.380> trying<00:03:48.770> to<00:03:48.860> use<00:03:49.040> using<00:03:49.700> my<00:03:49.790> speed<00:03:49.850> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
know trying to use using my speed I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.730 
know trying to use using my speed I
think<00:03:51.020> as<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.170> team<00:03:51.440> we<00:03:51.680> we<00:03:52.550> had<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:53.060> good<00:03:53.930> good

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
think as a team we we had a good good

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.590 
think as a team we we had a good good
group<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.250> speed<00:03:55.520> so<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.030> think<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.480> was<00:03:56.570> a

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
group with speed so I think that was a

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.630 
group with speed so I think that was a
strength<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.050> hours<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:58.130> know<00:03:58.280> he<00:03:58.490> was

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
strength of hours and you know he was

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.750 
strength of hours and you know he was
really<00:03:59.300> emphasizing<00:04:00.290> using<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.460> think

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
really emphasizing using that so I think

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.730 
really emphasizing using that so I think
we're<00:04:02.090> all<00:04:02.210> looking<00:04:02.360> forward<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.900> but

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
we're all looking forward to that but

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.560 
we're all looking forward to that but
even<00:04:03.830> with<00:04:03.980> good<00:04:04.250> speed<00:04:04.520> and<00:04:04.820> being<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.360> team

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
even with good speed and being a team

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.180 
even with good speed and being a team
that<00:04:05.690> had<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> lot<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.050> talent<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.950> were<00:04:07.070> in

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
that had a lot of talent you were in

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.970 
that had a lot of talent you were in
tenth<00:04:07.400> place<00:04:07.550> on<00:04:07.940> februari<00:04:08.720> 50<00:04:09.080> did<00:04:09.830> you

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
tenth place on februari 50 did you

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.680 
tenth place on februari 50 did you
really<00:04:10.130> think<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.580> reaching<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.150> plows<00:04:11.360> was

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
really think that reaching the plows was

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.800 
really think that reaching the plows was
was<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.560> possibility<00:04:13.000> yeah<00:04:14.000> we<00:04:14.180> believe<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.660> I

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
was a possibility yeah we believe it I

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.199 
was a possibility yeah we believe it I
mean<00:04:15.050> we<00:04:15.280> we<00:04:16.280> were<00:04:16.370> shooting<00:04:16.549> for<00:04:16.820> eight<00:04:16.910> I

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
mean we we were shooting for eight I

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.300 
mean we we were shooting for eight I
mean<00:04:17.570> that's<00:04:17.660> that's<00:04:18.590> what<00:04:18.799> we<00:04:18.890> needed<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.160> get

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
mean that's that's what we needed to get

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.460 
mean that's that's what we needed to get
in<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.519> playoffs<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:20.090> we<00:04:20.720> still<00:04:20.989> knew<00:04:21.200> we<00:04:21.380> had

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
in the playoffs so we still knew we had

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.010 
in the playoffs so we still knew we had
time<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.400> think<00:04:22.850> we<00:04:23.180> also<00:04:23.330> realized<00:04:23.840> we

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
time and I think we also realized we

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.800 
time and I think we also realized we
need<00:04:24.140> some<00:04:24.320> help<00:04:24.500> from<00:04:24.650> other<00:04:24.860> teams<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.810> on

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
need some help from other teams and on

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.980 
need some help from other teams and on
that<00:04:27.080> side<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.350> things<00:04:27.470> but<00:04:27.890> we<00:04:28.550> knew<00:04:28.700> if<00:04:28.820> we

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
that side of things but we knew if we

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.650 
that side of things but we knew if we
bear<00:04:29.990> down<00:04:30.200> for<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.910> couple<00:04:32.150> months<00:04:32.300> that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
bear down for for a couple months that

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.570 
bear down for for a couple months that
you<00:04:33.170> know<00:04:33.620> maybe<00:04:33.890> we<00:04:34.010> could<00:04:34.250> turn<00:04:34.400> things

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
you know maybe we could turn things

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.900 
you know maybe we could turn things
around<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.270> we<00:04:36.230> were<00:04:36.350> lucky<00:04:36.560> we<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:37.640> know<00:04:37.730> we

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
around so we were lucky we you know we

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.480 
around so we were lucky we you know we
worked<00:04:38.210> hard<00:04:38.480> and<00:04:38.950> seating<00:04:39.950> probably<00:04:40.340> some

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
worked hard and seating probably some

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.000 
worked hard and seating probably some
really<00:04:40.700> good<00:04:40.820> results<00:04:41.030> right<00:04:41.419> away<00:04:41.800> in<00:04:42.800> your

did you think about those two guys and

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.270 
did you think about those two guys and
how<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.090> would<00:04:59.360> kind<00:04:59.810> of<00:04:59.840> mesh<00:05:00.020> together<00:05:00.280> I

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
how you would kind of mesh together I

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.710 
how you would kind of mesh together I
wasn't<00:05:01.970> sure<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.120> don't<00:05:02.360> think<00:05:02.540> you're<00:05:02.630> ever

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
wasn't sure I don't think you're ever

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.750 
wasn't sure I don't think you're ever
sure<00:05:03.020> till<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.620> play<00:05:03.800> with<00:05:03.919> guys<00:05:04.130> but<00:05:04.520> I

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
sure till you play with guys but I

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.360 
sure till you play with guys but I
thought<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:06.590> know<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.770> first<00:05:06.950> few<00:05:07.190> games

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
thought you know the first few games

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.130 
thought you know the first few games
there<00:05:07.880> were<00:05:08.030> some<00:05:08.240> there<00:05:08.480> was<00:05:08.600> some<00:05:08.750> chemistry

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
there were some there was some chemistry

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.640 
there were some there was some chemistry
there<00:05:09.200> and

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
there and

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.400 
there and
no<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.370> think<00:05:11.669> what<00:05:12.120> they<00:05:12.270> both<00:05:12.449> frames<00:05:12.810> you

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
no I think what they both frames you

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.400 
no I think what they both frames you
know<00:05:13.440> guys<00:05:13.740> who<00:05:13.770> are<00:05:14.479> going<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.570> work<00:05:15.960> hard<00:05:15.990> for

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
know guys who are going to work hard for

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.590 
know guys who are going to work hard for
box<00:05:16.680> they're<00:05:16.979> going<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.310> battle<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.120> think

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
box they're going to battle and I think

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.480

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
the playoff picture maybe six or seven

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.840

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.170 
would be big I don't know if anybody
ever<00:05:34.860> thought<00:05:34.949> that<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.699> would<00:05:35.880> sweep<00:05:36.150> the

trip but you did was that kind of a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.159 
trip but you did was that kind of a
turning<00:05:38.910> point<00:05:38.940> when<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.270> felt<00:05:39.509> we<00:05:39.840> really<00:05:40.050> do

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
turning point when you felt we really do

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.090 
turning point when you felt we really do
have<00:05:40.199> a<00:05:40.320> chance<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.650> do<00:05:40.740> something<00:05:40.949> special

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
think so we you know we knew that was

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.710 
think so we you know we knew that was
going<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.110> be<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.229> big<00:05:46.410> test<00:05:46.590> for<00:05:46.770> us<00:05:46.949> and<00:05:47.720> that

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
going to be a big test for us and that

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.510 
going to be a big test for us and that
was<00:05:48.870> not<00:05:49.050> an<00:05:49.139> easy<00:05:49.229> trip<00:05:49.650> at<00:05:49.830> all<00:05:49.919> or<00:05:50.280> playing
