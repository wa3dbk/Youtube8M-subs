00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
suspension underneath it so it is a

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.099 
suspension underneath it so it is a
lowrider<00:00:20.240> yeah<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.600> ever<00:00:21.810> was<00:00:22.050> one

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
lowrider yeah if there ever was one

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.070 
lowrider yeah if there ever was one
before<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.980> wheels<00:00:25.130> fry<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> lowest<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.730> all

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
piece of plywood and cut it out on a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
piece of plywood and cut it out on a
shape<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.399> along<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:42.410> back

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
shape right here to go along here back

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.670 
shape right here to go along here back
here<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.850> through<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.190> then<00:00:48.680> have

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
here and up through here and then have

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200

like<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> couple<00:00:50.129> brackets<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> holes

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
like a couple brackets all the holes

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.049 
like a couple brackets all the holes
here<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.680> maybe<00:00:53.370> drill<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> couple<00:00:53.879> holes

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
here here and maybe drill a couple holes

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
here here and maybe drill a couple holes
there<00:00:55.160> in<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.960> yep<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:59.010> quickly<00:00:59.219> bolt

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.930 

relatively<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.690> same<00:01:24.900> seat<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.880> what<00:01:26.880> I'm

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
relatively the same seat so what I'm

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.280 
relatively the same seat so what I'm
going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.120> do<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.660> put<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.960> forward

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
going to do is and then put it forward

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.950 
going to do is and then put it forward
to<00:01:28.440> come<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.160> -<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> side<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.720> there

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to come out here - the side and go there

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
to come out here - the side and go there
and<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.130> probably<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and then I'm probably gonna have to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.410 
and then I'm probably gonna have to
build<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.120> up<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:34.250> then<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> platform<00:01:36.060> here

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
build it up and then the platform here

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330 
build it up and then the platform here
and<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> couple<00:01:37.410> legs<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.190> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and have a couple legs going down the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.440 
and have a couple legs going down the
side<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.910> do<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
side and then what I'm going to do is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.230 
side and then what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.750> build<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.050> seat

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
I'm going to build the seat

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.830 
I'm going to build the seat
hopefully<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.360> I'll<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.690> I'll<00:01:45.810> put

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
hopefully what I'll do is I'll put

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.710 
hopefully what I'll do is I'll put
hinges<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> front<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.550> have<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.090> seat

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
hinges on the front and have the seat

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350 
hinges on the front and have the seat
up<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.800> can<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.190> get<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.400> full<00:01:50.790> apartment

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
up so I can still get a full apartment

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.810 
up so I can still get a full apartment
here<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> bend<00:01:54.300> a<00:01:54.649> bar

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
here and then I'm going to bend a bar

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.650 
here and then I'm going to bend a bar
roll<00:01:56.820> around<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.940> have<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> backrest

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
roll around so you can have a backrest

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.120 
roll around so you can have a backrest
for<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.050> people<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.500> back<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
for that people in the back and then I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.410 
for that people in the back and then I
gotta<00:02:02.310> figure<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.580> how<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.940> make<00:02:03.180> these

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
gotta figure out how to make these

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.469 
gotta figure out how to make these
handlebars<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.830> side<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:06.360> they

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
handlebars that go on the side but they

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
handlebars that go on the side but they
can<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.690> something<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> hold<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.710> from

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
can have something to hold on to it from

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.340 
can have something to hold on to it from
the<00:02:07.979> back<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.830> we'll<00:02:11.070> see<00:02:11.250> how<00:02:11.280> that'll

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the back but we'll see how that'll

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.880 
the back but we'll see how that'll
happen<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:14.070> got<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.890> suspension

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
happen I just got to get the suspension
