 presentation that in less than five 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.300
 minutes summarize what are the crypto 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.950

 this means my presentation is called 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.120
 bitcoins enrolled forex one 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.610
 interactive presentation 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.050
 everything you have to know in less 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.710
 five minutes and the first steps 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.510
 to earn your first crypto currency 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.570
 first of all it's a crypt 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.219
 currency is a decentralized currency or 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.649
 it does not belong to any reservation 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.300
 private of any country or bank in 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.190
 specific 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 when the crypt currency reaches its top 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.620
 you do not create more money unlike what 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.390
 what happens with the money of the countries the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.540
 which has to be reproduced 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.850
 several times to stop 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.460
 continue to flow the economy but 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.900
 create the phenomenon called inflation there 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 certain described says the market 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.620
 which are equivalent to a regular currency 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.050
 but in the form of virtual credits 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.810
 we can see several here we can see the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.720
 bit coin the light coin the dodge coin and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 so many that also have a value 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.640
 already established in the market 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 international 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.380
 is a common method to gain crypto 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.350
 currency is 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.329
 look at those that refers to the process of 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.219
 Acquire alone or in a group 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.789
 bitcoins packages through the 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.560
 mining what this means 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:39.150
 basically to use the power of your 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.120
 computer to decrypt some 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.270
 codes that carry 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.920
 well enough time to decrypt by 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.990
 that many computers are needed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 and on many occasions it's time to do something 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.450
 called mining 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.420
 with company as it touches 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.100
 do it with several people or us 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.500
 I could not do it with computers 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.330
 normal at this time so if 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.580
 you do not have the right hardware to master 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.160
 any type of crypto and that's going to be 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 a little harder we have for another 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.330
 side the falses the phases of his eye 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 grifo in Spanish is a web page that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.580
 gives you micro fractions of the crypt 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.930
 currency as for example I have already hung 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.460
 previously videos where they give away 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.710
 ketosis a satoshi equals 0.70 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.569
 social to the right and a bitcoins or 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.120
 one equals 100 million unleashed sis 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.150
 so there are pages that give 30 50 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.709
 100 200 500 up to 10,000 and 20,000 is 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.019
 come to win me so it's a good 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.060
 a good way to start so that your 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.910
 first 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.050
 in this case bitcoins but it could 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.209
 get with any other kind of 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.000
 direct currency of what we call 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.380
 spoken gets crypto maybe like the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.690
 money in your business this is very easy 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.450
 you simply receive the transactions in 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.060
 you on your wallet we'll see more 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.069
 go ahead and boom ready if it's a 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.750
 Anonymous transaction that you have with 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.510
 another person and there's 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.400
 no type of restriction with this type 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 of action 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.680
 You can also accept donations from 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.370
 crypto currency that is basically data 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.210
 a code of the ual and that people you 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.210
 donate money there 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.879
 how can you start earning money 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.489
 through this the first step is to create 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.090
 a wallet or purse that is this that 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.099
 we have here 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.010
 more or less that way you would see a keep a 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.860
 coin purse 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.720
 and after creating the purse it 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.780
 leaned in the cor of the crypt of sight 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.280
 with your computer and that's it. 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.829
 when the water is left you believe 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.150
 immediately a purse and with the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.260
 address this purse but you can 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.319
 start receiving and sending money 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.319
