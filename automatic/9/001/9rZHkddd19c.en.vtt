00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.099
 are welcome here is another video 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.529
 unofficial first video the first 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.840
 video I'm commenting after 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.160
 turned the year 2015 is here commented 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.170
 a video for you 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.390
 unfortunately as fifth in much in the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.390
 background time in the first double straight 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.040
 yes two of them in a match just smoke 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.809
 Who was really cool in my opinion? 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.150
 one thing I've always wanted to bring to 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.309
 You were giving something else, number. 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.080
 2 did not get it I just have to think that two 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.920
 double nuclear not only has two 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.269
 stools also because only because I 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.440
 I was trying to get here with guns. 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.960
 different etc 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.119
 It will be but the excitement unfortunately my 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.330
 first download enem along with others 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.830
 of denis stored with the same weapon and 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.600
 for you guys want to know 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.670
 I use the sm1 with an extended comb the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.040
 long pipe do not know how does a name 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.640
 Portuguese but it is the advance dry clean e 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.490
 flu is to decrease the recall not 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.719
 I know how I got the front butt 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.789
 nor Portuguese because as now the 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.350
 There are already normal for me in Brazil is 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.259
 normal when the codes in 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.899
 Portuguese 18 months I think it is 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.969
 one thing that helped novice enough 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.799
 to play to get used to the game 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.600
 people buy game now i was 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.119
 young English because I really 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.549
 I just can not get used to it. 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.899
 It's just hard because I do not know the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.429
 name of things in Portuguese then 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.319
 You know what the name of the 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.520
 advance drives and canon in Portuguese 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.560
 leave in comments 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.689
 but that's what the sm1's that for me is 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.450
 currently the best weapon in the super game 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.380
 oval after she was from the fairy I do not know 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.090
 very good 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.909
 you make a video more forward was 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.270
 the best of it I do not see much 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.759
 need but finally 2015 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.740
 fortunately we have here another new year the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.780
 my first video the first video that 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.509
 I do not even comment after the year 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.730
 new and I wanted to know where that you 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.130
 the new year of you I already spoke 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.480
 previously but it goes that someone had 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.830
 what to change plans something I saw 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 a lot of people that one was going to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.630
 cruise other human partner I found 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.980
 well order happy face there for all 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.319
 you already 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.060
 The very cool trainee I was once the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.920
 cruise season spend the new year the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.500
 cruise is a very hour thing but 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.470
 they keep the fires there under me 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 here in SÃ£o Paulo, even one hour I got 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.930
 see the fires of the apartment paulista 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.730
 Where I live was very beautiful and well on time. 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.489
 and as I said you are normal until 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.080
 After dinner again, it's not mine. 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.760
 family see the fires all but us 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.209
 started to see game of thrones the first 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.860
 episode this guy they saw the first 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.319
 fucking positive episode on the day 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.000
 The next time I woke up with them, I saw 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.410
 I did not suffer as a result of the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.829
 series a very cool thing is that when 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.810
 Do you watch a movie or review a movie? 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.690
 reread the book begins to pick up details 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.400
 he had never realized this self. 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.500
 I think it's interesting not to be a 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 A good movie is a book I like to read 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.190
 because you start to get a detail 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.870
 so much more hours 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.420
 but this is not a subject of video that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.329
 I wanted to talk to you today. Can I? 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.269
 twist and a half I will not say is a subject 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.760
 controversial what is it about me having an account 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.769
 secondary to play against clubs to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.019
 find more in the encore and get more 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.569
 This is something that has 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.700
 messed up my 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.470
 comments and there are people who scold 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.700
 of them said that I do not know how to play with their 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.109
 game against the club 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.450
 I do not want me to want to leave 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.569
 This is clear to you only if you do not 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.030
 understand me if the brain does not process 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.079
 is that all the lines place on youtube 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.000
 the nuclear lobby who of 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.099
 election against no bis 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.209
 the only thing in this code you have 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.030
 have a conception of the area of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.579
 low level advertising to play 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.260
 against last luzhkov did not have because 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.669
 It's one thing that bothers you is that 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.829
 In this game you do not play 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.540
 depending on your connection you play 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.040
 depending on your ability of your 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.470
 assistants do not even have a disability 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.150
 Because for me, the obvious opinion does not define 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.919
 skills a thing also that the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.769
 people do not understand or do not work 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.449
 define ability do not pick up game 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.880
 place because of your skill you 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.460
 no one because because of the lobby 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.199
 then all in English in the past 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.490
 other cuts are against the bis is a 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.440
 normal thing 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.760
 It's a thing that people at least 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.340
 do not understand 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.160
 but I think I know you'll get one of 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.480
 find a shovel in the panel against the 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.510
 Optimal team 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.910
 not will not catch you will pick up 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.490
 none with the traffic that has run out 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.730
 buy the game this is normal has always been 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.450
 so the code only has exceptions of course 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.000
 you get a nei with a prestige of the 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.580
 other side with a face 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.560
 conca of 2 is going to get a face 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.390
 normal one I have friends who already 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.190
 they took the main service account 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.730
 I bring youtube content to game. 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.120
 because my channel he has always been focused on 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.850
 players scorsese jump whoever 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.040
 Dinei be all these things my channel 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.320
 always been focused on this emotional goes 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.960
 being will continue to be focused on this 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.760
 because in my main account only 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.720
 I was playing against my competitive friends 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.970
 only played against several lines the room 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.640
 I think he just did not play against the green. 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.780
 so the crime happens so complete 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.810
 they it is with low inventories 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.640
 for me to find is more like this 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.310
 game because it did not contain a term 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.560
 People like to use offended 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.800
 An offense if a newbie because I already went 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.290
 novice w3 not I already took much shopping 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.050
 of dollars I've already taken moves without japan 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.940
 on one side benÃ­tez already took ab when 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.940
 it was number also not beginners you 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.290
 no experience with the game then 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.660
 Now that's what I wanted to clarify're 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.460
 solar to top fit here is in 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.920
 English on youtube are against beginners 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.720
 It's me who made it clear that my section 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.960
 of good comments or comments 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.440
 constructive compliments series ideas 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.340
 all the things who's talking shit goes 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.980
 to take a shower 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.530
 basically it's so, so I do not care 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.210
 you're talking shit just a 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.650
 something that many people were talking 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.570
 that he made it clear 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.780
 I want to bring content to you. 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.860
 gameplay because if not me neither that posted 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.110
 on the right channel 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.520
 So I want to have content for you, I 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.310
 I just do not understand the people who 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.390
 they get so bitchy because of this because 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.430
 it has always been like that 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.129
 who strike kept complaining that it was 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.550
 against the bpn found no 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.249
 But I doubt if you caught oab against the cloud I 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.229
 I got it understood the people get the enem 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:54.419
 and people get their things against the 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.029
 name is so the law of the code that neither 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.889
 the law of your life lives and grows and 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.029
 dies is the law of replay code is 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.209
 against bus 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:04.499
 put it on your head, it's good, it's good 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:06.509
 video coming to an end 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:09.539
 normally the child already in 2015 happy 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.550
 for everyone who is not everyone who 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.129
 reads clichy business and I hope the channel 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.619
 only has to grow because regress does not have 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:18.599
 how and if you do not know each one is 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:21.749
