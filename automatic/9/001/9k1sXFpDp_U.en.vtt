shockwave so stick around you're going

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:44.060 
shockwave so stick around you're going
to<00:00:35.760> enjoy<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:38.030> here<00:00:39.030> he<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.770> g1<00:00:40.770> shockwave<00:00:43.070> if

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to enjoy this here he is g1 shockwave if

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.069 
to enjoy this here he is g1 shockwave if
we<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> close<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.540> here<00:00:45.750> let's<00:00:46.470> see

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
we take a close up from here let's see

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.950 
we take a close up from here let's see
the<00:00:49.079> barrel<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.510> actually<00:00:51.660> where

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the barrel and here it's actually where

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.430 
the barrel and here it's actually where
shockwave<00:00:52.440> maces<00:00:52.829> lights<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:57.200> one<00:00:58.200> though

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
shockwave maces lights and so one though

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.299 
shockwave maces lights and so one though
and<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.920> switch

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and if we go to the back here and switch

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:11.150 
and if we go to the back here and switch
it<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:03.420> another<00:01:03.629> laser<00:01:03.899> moon<00:01:10.160> shockwave

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
it and get another laser moon shockwave

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.810 
it and get another laser moon shockwave
was<00:01:11.490> always<00:01:11.759> awesome<00:01:12.530> for<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.619> reason<00:01:13.820> well

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
going to transform them pretty basic

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.230 
going to transform them pretty basic
transformation<00:01:42.649> press<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.830> pull<00:01:44.039> off<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
transformation press we pull off this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.859 
transformation press we pull off this

there<00:02:36.460> are<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.940> shockwave<00:02:41.910> robot<00:02:44.280> out

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
there are you have shockwave robot out

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.300 
there are you have shockwave robot out
if<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.930> use<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:49.470> right<00:02:50.470> let's<00:02:50.770> go<00:02:50.920> up<00:02:51.070> here
