can see the color a little bit better
this<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:58.050> sure<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.980> feeling

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
this way so I'm not sure if I'm feeling

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.479 
this way so I'm not sure if I'm feeling
this<00:00:59.550> wig<00:00:59.850> especially<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.530> chose<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
this wig especially on me I chose this

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.039 
this wig especially on me I chose this
color<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> wanted<00:01:03.570> something<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
color because I wanted something a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230 
color because I wanted something a
little<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.350> different<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:06.000> really

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
little bit different but I'm not really

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
little bit different but I'm not really
sure<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.960> me<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.320> think<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.770> hair<00:01:08.040> would

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sure it's for me I think this hair would

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
sure it's for me I think this hair would
be<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.360> was<00:01:09.540> curled<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
be really pretty if it was curled so it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
be really pretty if it was curled so it
would<00:01:10.409> match<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.680> bang<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.970> gonna

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
would match the bang but I'm not gonna

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.929 
would match the bang but I'm not gonna
curl<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> I'll<00:01:12.990> tell<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> guys<00:01:13.619> why<00:01:14.159> later

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
curl it and I'll tell you guys why later

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.719 
curl it and I'll tell you guys why later
