let's<00:01:20.160> do<00:01:20.340> water<00:01:20.640> because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.270 

instead<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.720> playing<00:01:26.020> with<00:01:26.290> fire<00:01:26.590> we<00:01:26.950> decide

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
instead of playing with fire we decide

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.190 
instead of playing with fire we decide
to<00:01:27.430> take<00:01:27.580> photos<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.150> things<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.780> are<00:01:28.900> less

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
to take photos of things that are less

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.070 
to take photos of things that are less
of<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.710> health<00:01:29.950> hazard<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:31.210> some<00:01:31.420> areas<00:01:31.690> are

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
of a health hazard so some areas are

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.680 
of a health hazard so some areas are
 quite<00:01:32.800> literally<00:01:33.400> crammed<00:01:33.820> for<00:01:34.210> places

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
 quite literally crammed for places

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.930 
 quite literally crammed for places
for<00:01:34.870> crapping<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:35.980> you<00:01:36.040> can<00:01:36.250> liven<00:01:36.460> up<00:01:36.670> by

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
for crapping in so you can liven up by

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.360 
for crapping in so you can liven up by
doing<00:01:37.290> macro<00:01:38.290> shots<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.740> things<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.130> aren't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
doing macro shots of things that aren't

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.710 
doing macro shots of things that aren't
crap<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.210> lining<00:01:41.020> up<00:01:41.229> with<00:01:42.100> some<00:01:42.250> water<00:01:42.720> here

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
crap and lining up with some water here

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.280 
crap and lining up with some water here
we<00:01:43.810> go

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
we go

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.380 
we go
so<00:01:44.770> these<00:01:44.920> people<00:01:45.580> like<00:01:45.760> shooting<00:01:46.150> clothes

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
so these people like shooting clothes

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.050 
so these people like shooting clothes
tend<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.380> carry<00:01:47.590> these<00:01:47.830> sprays<00:01:48.760> around

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
tend to carry these sprays around

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.820 
tend to carry these sprays around
because<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:49.960> download<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.380> water<00:01:50.590> onto

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
because you can download the water onto

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.160 
because you can download the water onto
the<00:01:50.950> flowers<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:51.820> plants<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.840> give<00:01:53.020> that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
the flowers and plants to give that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
the flowers and plants to give that

in it so let's get started we got this
firing<00:03:18.459> up<00:03:19.209> against<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.780> wall<00:03:19.959> because

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
firing up against the wall because

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.690 
firing up against the wall because
there's<00:03:21.280> no<00:03:21.459> point<00:03:21.790> firing<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:24.070> translucent

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
there's no point firing the translucent

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.479 
there's no point firing the translucent
stuff<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.320> what<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:26.560> want<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.890> darker<00:03:27.310> room

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.850 
stuff so what we want is a darker room
to<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.870> illuminating

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
to have just that illuminating

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.500 
to have just that illuminating
everything<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.370> I'm<00:03:31.030> gonna<00:03:31.090> have<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.299> slow

everything and I'm gonna have a slow

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.690 
everything and I'm gonna have a slow
shutter<00:03:31.870> speed<00:03:32.230> because<00:03:33.130> I'm<00:03:33.489> going<00:03:33.639> to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
shutter speed because I'm going to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
shutter speed because I'm going to
trigger<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.419> man

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
trigger that man

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.500 
trigger that man
and<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.950> can't<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.760> split<00:03:37.030> second

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
and I can't do that in a split second

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.380 
and I can't do that in a split second
because<00:03:37.600> I'm<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:37.870> Superman<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:39.300> let's<00:03:40.300> get
