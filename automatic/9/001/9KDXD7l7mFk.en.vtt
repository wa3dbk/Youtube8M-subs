we<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.370> another<00:02:14.550> command<00:02:14.940> center<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.450> so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
we do see another command center here so

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800 
we do see another command center here so
this<00:02:16.170> will<00:02:16.379> protect<00:02:16.650> from<00:02:17.430> any<00:02:17.670> other<00:02:17.970> units

only<00:02:43.049> costing<00:02:43.379> 300<00:02:43.890> minerals<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.430> as<00:02:45.090> opposed
