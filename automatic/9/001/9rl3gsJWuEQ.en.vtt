 as always we find ourselves 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 today for a new 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.430
 fashion presentation on happy truck 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.789
 simulator 2 it's just the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.199
 presentation of actros black edition 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 So here I am right away 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 show saint jean bart who can 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.039
 change that we'll put it in big 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.579
 kabylie in it either went 4 for once 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.360
 we will put the engine so 18.61 v8 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.800
 actros black edition that's it 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 perfect at the interior level in may 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 this one then yes what is enough 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.879
 pity with this pack there is that we did not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 no interior that goes with the black 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.610
 edition so I will try to find 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.860
 that a beautiful black and white black interior 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.149
 or something like that and then I 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 you will make a small presentation of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.870
 vote on it so I 'm going to see from my 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.789
 side it should be at least 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.789
 inside another than the trust 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.530
 editing to change a little bit 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 then at the level of paintings of course 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 we put the paint down black edition 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.380
 so in full black 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.640
 and then here I am going to show you a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.369
 little bit what is really great 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.509
 with sts actros black edition is that 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.369
 all the accessories you go 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.080
 put good order in black finally not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.210
 necessarily all born in any case by 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.799
 example the rims like even be the one 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.540
 there they are in red as against 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.030
 game but this one she they are in 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.299
 black in glossy black more so that's it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.729
 rather nice here and here so 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.939
 here already there frankly there is a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 super nice mouth then we put him the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.060
 small square snow 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.799
 the same for the exhaust pipes 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.780
 a really nice thing 500 task in 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.479
 black yes so that really gives some 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.880
 nice thing we'll put him a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.920
 second skin by here so here 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 always in black 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.509
 something else the caps I'm going to do 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 but it seems to me that she is 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.159
 almost all in black so that's the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.479
 Black the prettiest for me is the one 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 in black frankly she just 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.829
 beautiful where alone and it's true that 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.979
 this one I prefer because it takes 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.039
 really the color of the truck is the same 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.810
 so for the buffalo he 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.250
 also goes black and gray so 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.409
 Strongly frankly it really gives 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.019
 something good so that's the 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.700
 league all black in black like the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.109
 buffalo that sown in black so that's 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.140
 really full black friends because that 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:26.900
 you have to love black to have to 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.239
 put this mode there the same bars 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.000
 andra who set the black what 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.239
 we still have mirrors 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.250
 we can put them finally painting and 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.780
 chromium 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.280
 so see there are really multiple 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.379
 possibilities in fact the black mode 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.150
 edition is simply a way 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.280
 that will allow you to put all the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.650
 truck accessories in black to have 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.629
 people in black etc and having in 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.280
 the black edition painting all 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.959
 simply 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.310
 that's it for this little presentation of 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.650
 wons in any case I hope this 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.269
 video you will have fun I think 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.980
 have said everything about this presentation 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.629
 as said I will try to find a 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.060
 interior that goes well with this truck 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.010
 in any case personally I love 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 this truck France even maybe 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.629
 use it in my career tracking I 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.859
 will keep you informed 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.419
 finally here we say ah the next 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.729
