here<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.869> let<00:00:28.500> me<00:00:28.529> show<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
here so let me show you how this is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.459

useful so let me show you a little bit

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
useful so let me show you a little bit
closer<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.340> detail<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.090> working

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
closer and in detail what we're working

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.200 
closer and in detail what we're working
with<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> basically<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.399> five<00:00:41.940> liter

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
with so basically this is a five liter

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.250 
with so basically this is a five liter
capacity<00:00:43.100> heavy<00:00:44.100> con<00:00:44.340> canvasback<00:00:45.260> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
capacity heavy con canvasback and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.900 
capacity heavy con canvasback and
actually<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> pre<00:00:47.460> filtering

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
actually this kind of pre filtering

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.119 
actually this kind of pre filtering
technology<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.660> been<00:00:48.870> around<00:00:49.079> probably<00:00:49.739> ever

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
technology has been around probably ever

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
technology has been around probably ever
since<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> Revolutionary<00:00:51.329> War<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:52.469> what

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
since the Revolutionary War that's what

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700 
since the Revolutionary War that's what
the<00:00:52.770> Americans<00:00:53.629> now<00:00:54.629> what's<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:54.899> nice<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the Americans now what's really nice it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
the Americans now what's really nice it
has<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.129> heavy-duty<00:00:56.579> grommet<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.469> some

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
has a heavy-duty grommet and some

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.189 
has a heavy-duty grommet and some
military<00:00:58.949> 550<00:00:59.879> cord<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.840> guys<00:01:00.989> are

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
military 550 cord if you guys are

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.500 
military 550 cord if you guys are
wondering<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.710> durability<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.879> how<00:01:03.329> they

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
wondering about durability and how they

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
wondering about durability and how they
they're<00:01:03.840> holding<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.320> don't<00:01:04.979> worry<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.549> one

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
they're holding up don't worry this one

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.270 
they're holding up don't worry this one
actually<00:01:06.150> obviously<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:07.260> five<00:01:07.590> times<00:01:07.979> all

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
actually obviously good five times all

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.480 
actually obviously good five times all
right

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
right

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
right
I<00:01:08.760> even<00:01:09.689> after<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> video<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:10.830> showing

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
I even after the video that I'm showing

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
I even after the video that I'm showing
you<00:01:11.310> now<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> brand<00:01:13.439> new<00:01:13.619> one

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you now so and this is a brand new one

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.920 
you now so and this is a brand new one
as<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> guys<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> difference<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
as you guys can see the difference is

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.760 
as you guys can see the difference is
very<00:01:15.960> minimal<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> product<00:01:18.479> specs<00:01:18.869> they

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
very minimal on the product specs they

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
very minimal on the product specs they
even<00:01:20.070> say<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.670> reason<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.479> isn't

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
even say if for some reason this isn't

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
even say if for some reason this isn't
filtering<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.470> best<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.939> go

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
filtering as best as it can just go

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.130 
filtering as best as it can just go
ahead<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.420> flip<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> bag<00:01:24.960> inside<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
ahead and flip the bag inside out and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
ahead and flip the bag inside out and
then<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.950> start<00:01:29.280> filter<00:01:29.610> filtering

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
then you can start filter filtering

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
then you can start filter filtering
water<00:01:30.540> again<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:32.100> using<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.520> bag<00:01:32.670> inside

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
water again just using the bag inside

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.300 
water again just using the bag inside
out<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.439> filtering<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
out because as you're filtering all that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
out because as you're filtering all that
extra<00:01:35.640> water<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> wash<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.320> grime

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
extra water is going to wash the grime

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.450 
extra water is going to wash the grime
and<00:01:38.040> crud<00:01:38.310> off<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:40.290> basically<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and crud off and you basically have a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
and crud off and you basically have a
two<00:01:42.150> by<00:01:42.329> fold<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.930> far<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> field<00:01:43.710> or

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
two by fold as far as in the field or

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
two by fold as far as in the field or
even<00:01:44.340> potentially<00:01:45.119> more<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.750> saying<00:01:45.930> if

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
even potentially more I'm just saying if

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
even potentially more I'm just saying if
you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.500> dirty<00:01:46.950> cruddy<00:01:47.520> water<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
you have really dirty cruddy water and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
you have really dirty cruddy water and
this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.750> how<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> bag<00:01:49.320> looks<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.890> flip

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
this is how the bag looks like flip

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
this is how the bag looks like flip
inside<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.390> guys<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.869> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
inside out as you guys can see it's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.609 
inside out as you guys can see it's
double<00:01:53.070> stitched<00:01:53.930> one<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> bottom<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
double stitched one on the bottom and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
double stitched one on the bottom and
one<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.920> top<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.479> definitely

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
one on top of that so this definitely

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.649 
one on top of that so this definitely
ensures<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:59.399> whatever<00:01:59.909> you're<00:02:00.270> carrying

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
ensures that whatever you're carrying

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.899 
ensures that whatever you're carrying
here<00:02:00.899> besides<00:02:01.259> water<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.950> dice<00:02:02.700> them

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
here besides water you can dice them

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.450 
here besides water you can dice them
definitely<00:02:03.090> hold<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> weight<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:05.009> towards

up this bag full water fill it up about
nine-tenths<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.150> way<00:03:36.600> up<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.890> water

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
nine-tenths of the way up with the water

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.960 
nine-tenths of the way up with the water
something<00:03:39.420> like<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.489> next<00:03:41.489> we're<00:03:41.880> going

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
something like this and next we're going

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
something like this and next we're going
to<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.360> hang<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.720> up<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.080> tree<00:03:43.519> can

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
to go and hang it up in a tree can

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.920 
to go and hang it up in a tree can
actually<00:03:44.760> notice<00:03:45.150> some<00:03:45.420> particulate

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
actually notice some particulate

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.210 
actually notice some particulate
floating<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:46.709> something<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.160> you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
floating in there something that you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.320 
floating in there something that you
definitely<00:03:47.610> don't<00:03:47.670> want<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.880> drink

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
definitely don't want to drink

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.130 
definitely don't want to drink
so<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.830> concept<00:03:50.340> after<00:03:50.550> it's<00:03:51.150> filled<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.959> let

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
so the concept after it's filled you let

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.990 
so the concept after it's filled you let
it<00:03:52.290> sit<00:03:52.620> there<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:52.980> about<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.190> minute<00:03:53.489> or<00:03:53.730> so

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
it sit there for about a minute or so

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.320 
it sit there for about a minute or so
until<00:03:54.300> all<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.350> water<00:03:55.650> from<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.010> outside<00:03:56.330> has

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
until all the water from the outside has

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.370 
until all the water from the outside has
drained<00:03:57.780> off<00:03:58.400> now<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.640> already<00:04:00.320> dripping<00:04:01.320> a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
drained off now it's already dripping a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.800 
drained off now it's already dripping a
little<00:04:01.739> bit<00:04:01.890> at<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.130> very<00:04:02.160> end<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.850> that's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
little bit at the very end and that's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.350 
little bit at the very end and that's
what<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.110> want<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.910> let<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.180> bag

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
what you want it to do so let the bag

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120 
what you want it to do so let the bag
sit<00:04:06.630> there<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> little<00:04:07.260> over<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.590> minute<00:04:07.830> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
sit there for a little over a minute to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.630 
sit there for a little over a minute to
allow<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.760> seepage<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:10.110> clean<00:04:10.320> up<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.640> base

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
allow the seepage to clean up the base

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.610 
allow the seepage to clean up the base
of<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.660> doesn't<00:04:12.989> drip<00:04:13.170> any<00:04:13.350> kind<00:04:13.590> of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
of this so it doesn't drip any kind of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.130 
of this so it doesn't drip any kind of
particulate<00:04:14.070> into<00:04:14.489> my<00:04:14.670> camp<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.720> I'm<00:04:15.810> go<00:04:15.989> ahead

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
particulate into my camp so I'm go ahead

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.660 
particulate into my camp so I'm go ahead
and<00:04:16.230> set<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.500> up

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.310 

you<00:04:19.670> guys<00:04:19.850> can<00:04:20.090> see<00:04:20.330> it<00:04:20.390> it's<00:04:20.900> gonna<00:04:21.110> take<00:04:21.290> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
you guys can see it it's gonna take a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.730 
you guys can see it it's gonna take a
little<00:04:21.620> little<00:04:22.220> time<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.700> fill<00:04:22.970> up<00:04:23.290> but<00:04:24.290> it's

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
little little time to fill up but it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:38.250 
little little time to fill up but it's
coming<00:04:25.100> through<00:04:25.130> fairly<00:04:25.760> nicely

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.890 

so<00:04:39.010> after<00:04:39.250> we<00:04:39.370> pre-filtered<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.390> got<00:04:40.750> my

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
so after we pre-filtered it I got my

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.650 
so after we pre-filtered it I got my
water<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.490> I'm<00:04:42.490> going<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.790> boil<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.510> it's

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
water and I'm going to boil it so it's

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.889 
water and I'm going to boil it so it's
safe<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.870> drink

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:51.899 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.119 

hopefully<00:04:52.899> not<00:04:53.050> too<00:04:53.229> much<00:04:53.439> ash<00:04:53.679> is<00:04:53.889> going<00:04:54.069> to

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
hopefully not too much ash is going to

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.100 
hopefully not too much ash is going to
fall<00:04:54.279> into<00:04:54.309> it<00:04:54.759> but<00:04:55.209> I<00:04:55.270> have<00:04:55.389> it<00:04:55.539> set<00:04:55.779> up<00:04:55.899> at<00:04:56.080> a

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
fall into it but I have it set up at a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.100 
fall into it but I have it set up at a
pretty<00:04:56.559> decent<00:04:56.589> angle<00:04:57.449> so<00:04:58.449> basically<00:04:58.990> as<00:04:59.050> the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
pretty decent angle so basically as the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.409 
pretty decent angle so basically as the
fire<00:04:59.409> is<00:04:59.619> dying<00:04:59.830> out<00:05:00.039> I<00:05:00.279> move<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.999> canteen<00:05:01.389> a

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
fire is dying out I move the canteen a

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.850 
fire is dying out I move the canteen a
little<00:05:01.659> bit<00:05:01.749> closer<00:05:01.959> and<00:05:02.259> you<00:05:02.319> as<00:05:02.469> you<00:05:02.709> guys

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
little bit closer and you as you guys

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.399 
little bit closer and you as you guys
can<00:05:03.069> see<00:05:03.219> it's<00:05:03.339> a<00:05:03.429> rolling<00:05:03.849> boil<00:05:04.240> which<00:05:05.139> means

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
can see it's a rolling boil which means

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.769 
can see it's a rolling boil which means
it's<00:05:05.589> pretty<00:05:05.889> much<00:05:06.039> ready<00:05:06.419> just<00:05:07.419> remember

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:07.779 
it's pretty much ready just remember

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.239 
it's pretty much ready just remember
whenever<00:05:07.959> you're<00:05:08.169> boiling<00:05:08.499> your<00:05:08.800> water<00:05:09.009> a

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:09.249 
whenever you're boiling your water a

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.029 
whenever you're boiling your water a
little<00:05:09.520> bit<00:05:09.639> of<00:05:09.819> it<00:05:09.969> will<00:05:10.209> evaporate<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:11.139> as

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
little bit of it will evaporate and as

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.010 
little bit of it will evaporate and as
in<00:05:12.429> my<00:05:12.580> case<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:13.119> will<00:05:13.300> you<00:05:13.659> might<00:05:13.809> get<00:05:13.990> a

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
in my case you will you might get a

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.570 
in my case you will you might get a
little<00:05:14.169> bit<00:05:14.379> of<00:05:14.469> ash<00:05:14.709> in<00:05:15.039> there<00:05:15.219> but<00:05:15.399> that's

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
little bit of ash in there but that's

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.379 
little bit of ash in there but that's
just<00:05:15.819> fine

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
just fine

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.889 
just fine
I<00:05:16.419> remember<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.559> quick<00:05:18.099> survival<00:05:18.789> hack<00:05:18.939> if<00:05:19.779> you

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:19.899 
I remember a quick survival hack if you

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.739 
I remember a quick survival hack if you
tilt<00:05:20.139> your<00:05:20.699> canteen<00:05:21.699> cup<00:05:21.729> whatever<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.539> use

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
tilt your canteen cup whatever you use

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.600 
tilt your canteen cup whatever you use
to<00:05:23.020> boil<00:05:23.499> your<00:05:23.649> water<00:05:23.709> just<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.249> little<00:05:24.279> bit

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
to boil your water just a little bit

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.209 
to boil your water just a little bit
most<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:25.509> ash<00:05:25.629> should<00:05:26.199> stay<00:05:26.619> on<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.919> far

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
most of the ash should stay on the far

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.730 
most of the ash should stay on the far
end<00:05:27.429> and<00:05:28.029> just<00:05:28.569> drink<00:05:28.749> it<00:05:28.869> really<00:05:29.169> slowly<00:05:29.469> and

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
end and just drink it really slowly and

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.429 
end and just drink it really slowly and
Asheville<00:05:29.949> either<00:05:30.490> settle<00:05:31.059> to<00:05:31.179> the<00:05:31.209> bottom<00:05:31.439> or

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:32.439 
Asheville either settle to the bottom or

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.980 
Asheville either settle to the bottom or
stay<00:05:32.889> on<00:05:33.009> one<00:05:33.219> side<00:05:33.519> the<00:05:34.419> water<00:05:34.599> has<00:05:34.809> cooled

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
stay on one side the water has cooled

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.480 
stay on one side the water has cooled
down<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.229> little<00:05:35.349> bit<00:05:35.649> and<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.860> kind<00:05:36.069> of<00:05:36.129> wish<00:05:36.279> I

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
down a little bit and I kind of wish I

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.850 
down a little bit and I kind of wish I
brought<00:05:36.550> some<00:05:36.909> tea<00:05:37.119> or<00:05:37.149> some<00:05:37.449> chai<00:05:37.659> to<00:05:38.589> put<00:05:38.769> in

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
brought some tea or some chai to put in

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.159 
brought some tea or some chai to put in
there<00:05:39.069> but<00:05:39.809> warm<00:05:41.189> warm<00:05:42.189> kulish<00:05:42.639> water<00:05:43.169> fresh

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
there but warm warm kulish water fresh

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.700 
there but warm warm kulish water fresh
from<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.499> mountains

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.060 

has<00:05:50.310> just<00:05:50.670> a<00:05:50.790> slight<00:05:51.240> taste<00:05:52.140> of<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.470> campfire<00:05:52.770> in

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
has just a slight taste of a campfire in

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.400 
has just a slight taste of a campfire in
there<00:05:53.250> or<00:05:53.430> maybe<00:05:53.910> just<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.690> smell<00:05:54.990> from<00:05:55.200> the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
there or maybe just the smell from the

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.710 
there or maybe just the smell from the
can<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:55.860> don't<00:05:56.730> know<00:05:56.760> but<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.180> water<00:05:57.360> is<00:05:57.480> pretty

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
can I don't know but the water is pretty

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.280 
can I don't know but the water is pretty
good<00:05:58.130> so<00:05:59.270> the<00:06:00.270> filter<00:06:00.570> works<00:06:00.720> pretty<00:06:01.080> good

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
good so the filter works pretty good

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.790 
good so the filter works pretty good
this<00:06:01.410> is<00:06:01.620> not<00:06:01.890> the<00:06:02.040> first<00:06:02.250> time<00:06:02.400> I've<00:06:02.610> used<00:06:02.880> it

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
this is not the first time I've used it

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.250 
this is not the first time I've used it
that's<00:06:04.800> about<00:06:05.070> I<00:06:05.720> think<00:06:06.720> this<00:06:06.870> is<00:06:06.990> basically

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
that's about I think this is basically

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.730 
that's about I think this is basically
the<00:06:07.440> fourth<00:06:07.680> time<00:06:07.890> I've<00:06:08.040> used<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.400> filter<00:06:08.820> so

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
the fourth time I've used that filter so

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.780 
the fourth time I've used that filter so
anyways<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:11.010> like<00:06:11.430> it

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
anyways I like it
