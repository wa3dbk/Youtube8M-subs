00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
somewhere I think that this was a good

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
somewhere I think that this was a good
deal<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.990> Mac<00:01:55.829> herion<00:01:56.610> heroine<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.780> can

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
deal for the Mac herion heroine I can

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139 
deal for the Mac herion heroine I can
say<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> heard<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.850> was<00:01:59.909> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
say that but I heard that this was a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.200 
say that but I heard that this was a
good<00:02:00.420> deal<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.140> lipstick<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.210> don't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
good deal for that lipstick so I don't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.800 
good deal for that lipstick so I don't
know<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> don't<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.409> MAC<00:02:05.250> lipstick<00:02:05.810> but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
know I don't have the MAC lipstick but

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
know I don't have the MAC lipstick but
it<00:02:07.619> looks<00:02:07.860> pretty<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.819> doesn't<00:02:09.179> really

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it looks pretty so it doesn't really

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.140 
it looks pretty so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.289> pronounce

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
matter if it's the do you pronounce

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.680 
matter if it's the do you pronounce
this<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.409> it<00:02:12.530> looks<00:02:12.680> like<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:14.510> that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
this is what it looks like but if that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.199 
this is what it looks like but if that
was<00:02:14.810> kind<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.080> cute<00:02:15.260> about<00:02:15.470> them<00:02:15.860> was<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
was kind of cute about them was that the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.880 
was kind of cute about them was that the
packaging<00:02:18.129> is<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:19.459> small<00:02:20.269> let<00:02:20.900> me<00:02:21.019> compare<00:02:21.709> it

packaging is so small let me compare it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.850 
packaging is so small let me compare it
to<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> normal<00:02:25.239> lipstick<00:02:26.860> but

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
to like this is the normal lipstick but

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.979 
to like this is the normal lipstick but
I<00:02:28.159> think<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.060> same<00:02:29.329> amount<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.140> product

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
I think it's the same amount of product

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.649 
I think it's the same amount of product
because<00:02:32.989> if<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.470> took<00:02:33.530> them<00:02:34.540> next<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.629> each

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
because if I took them next to each

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.339 
because if I took them next to each
other<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:37.099> look<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.640> same<00:02:37.670> so

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
other like this they look the same so

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.899 
other like this they look the same so
all<00:02:39.349> right<00:02:39.500> yeah<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:39.829> thought<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.370> packaging

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
all right yeah I thought the packaging

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.240 
all right yeah I thought the packaging
was<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.450> cute<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.680> haven't<00:02:42.980> tried

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
was really cute and I haven't tried

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.119 
was really cute and I haven't tried
these<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:45.019> I'm<00:02:45.140> gonna<00:02:45.290> try<00:02:45.500> them<00:02:45.799> and

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
these but I think I'm gonna try them and

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.330
