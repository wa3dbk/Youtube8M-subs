00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 pupils in groups 7 and 8 show the majority of the musicians in the videos 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
 is not 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.649
 in this way masters better every thirty-something good forty times in class 

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.160
 but when most still don't want the title other ways to get the post 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.069
 to get 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.929
 hey hey 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.119
 to hold 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.100
 The self-conscious but I fear that the club's thumb is limited 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.590
 and often followed by feeding 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.070
 the party is going to drive 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.020
 students from the school have registered for the election 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.920
 and masters each, along with nine others, was selected from fifteen hundred 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.200
 candidates work every day and it rains wrong and you do things well 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.990
 train and tried through over new and so on 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.920
 worse that is not a problem 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.810
 check out Geneva entrances too crazy and fun and freedom if it comes in 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.860
 get one of the nicest presents 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.930
 sometimes that will not happen sometime 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.010
 in that sense, the treatment can be just as a child, but I just think it's whole 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.580
 differently ronald vargas as for years just as an adult and just different 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.850
 then other people lie i always think i'm a few here i like 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.130
 I think for sure 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.480
 once a project from going to school I play too slow 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.830
 but you also can't teach 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.010
 as which of the cows wind incident two the teacher from the municipality winsum 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.340
 who may call themselves study the power of our country 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.880
 in 2007 the team that won in the surf at the crooked akersloot gamers 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.540
 according to the parents but i could have a big chance i never heard anything before 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.430
 also a school and electricians there is stories about bah and done and what 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.340
 for projects but daughter was a little uncertain about certain things and that has 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.140
 ie just be sure you can take it away 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.249
 all the stories 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.490
 don't make it because it is of course perfect 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.030
 if they do us is a bit sloppy and stock options clean up 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.180
 for the program one of not everything structured and t turret 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.029
 flexible better deployed the spring flood not only a disadvantage 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.780
 according to masters each self 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.459
 this is how the toughest stubborn character could work 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.749
 apple has an update of the traffic counts tonight I think 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:17.569
 myself from 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.610
 and only then go and see what I necessarily have to always have that a bit 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.219
 odd
