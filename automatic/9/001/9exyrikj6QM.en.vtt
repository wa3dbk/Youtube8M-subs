00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
outside cut cut cut I'm gonna go around

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.600 
outside cut cut cut I'm gonna go around
there<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.500> pretty<00:02:19.739> well<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> perfect

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
there so it's a pretty well a perfect

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.580 
there so it's a pretty well a perfect
circle<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:23.060> then<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.180> also<00:02:24.360> need<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.080> circle

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
circle and then we also need the circle

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.300 
circle and then we also need the circle
for<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.580> top<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.570> you're<00:02:27.720> gonna<00:02:27.870> take<00:02:28.140> your

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
for the top so you're gonna take your

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.210 
for the top so you're gonna take your
toilet<00:02:29.310> paper<00:02:29.519> roll<00:02:29.959> same<00:02:30.959> idea<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.470> imprint

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
toilet paper roll same idea just imprint

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.699 
toilet paper roll same idea just imprint
push<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.330> down<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.780> print<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.340> okay<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.530> I'll

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
push it down and print it okay and I'll

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.449 
push it down and print it okay and I'll
just<00:02:37.910> trim<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.440> around<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> outside<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
just trim that around the outside a

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.880 
just trim that around the outside a
little<00:02:41.640> bit<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.140> always<00:02:43.260> cut<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
little bit you can always cut it a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.880 
little bit you can always cut it a
little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.640> bigger<00:02:45.030> than<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.019> circle<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
little bit bigger than the circle so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.699 
little bit bigger than the circle so
it'll<00:02:47.100> really<00:02:47.640> cover<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> top<00:02:49.100> okay<00:02:51.200> there<00:02:52.200> so

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it'll really cover the top okay there so

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.569 
it'll really cover the top okay there so
that's<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:55.040> we're<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.070> gonna<00:02:56.340> make

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that's that and we're just gonna make

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.630 
that's that and we're just gonna make
sure<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:57.000> gonna<00:02:57.180> fit<00:02:57.540> about<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.519> we're

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
sure it's gonna fit about and then we're

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.530 
sure it's gonna fit about and then we're
gonna<00:02:59.760> put<00:03:00.000> some<00:03:00.269> hot<00:03:00.450> glue<00:03:00.560> around<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
gonna put some hot glue around the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.540 
gonna put some hot glue around the
outside

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.260 

okay<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:11.420> we<00:03:11.660> get<00:03:11.840> some<00:03:12.080> hot<00:03:12.290> glue<00:03:13.090> stick<00:03:14.090> that

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
okay so we get some hot glue stick that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.340 
okay so we get some hot glue stick that
on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.630> top<00:03:15.940> there<00:03:16.940> we<00:03:17.120> go<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.610> then<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.900> want

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
on the top there we go and then we want

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.520 
on the top there we go and then we want
to<00:03:21.470> glue<00:03:21.650> it's<00:03:22.340> really<00:03:22.640> stringy<00:03:23.110> that's<00:03:24.110> okay

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
to glue it's really stringy that's okay

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.980 
to glue it's really stringy that's okay
and<00:03:25.400> then<00:03:25.760> we're<00:03:26.090> gonna<00:03:26.210> glue<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.630> one<00:03:26.810> on

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
and then we're gonna glue that one on

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.760 
and then we're gonna glue that one on
there<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.130> for<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.550> I'll<00:03:29.030> actually<00:03:29.620> put<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
there so for that I'll actually put the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.410 
there so for that I'll actually put the
glue<00:03:30.980> around<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.900> bottom<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.970> doesn't<00:03:35.270> matter

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
glue around the bottom it doesn't matter

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.060 
glue around the bottom it doesn't matter
if<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:35.690> slop<00:03:36.050> over<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.500> edge<00:03:36.620> cuz<00:03:36.920> you're

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
if you slop over the edge cuz you're

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.400 
if you slop over the edge cuz you're
gonna<00:03:37.190> cover<00:03:37.490> it<00:03:37.730> with<00:03:37.760> some<00:03:38.180> with<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.200> beads

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
gonna cover it with some with the beads

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.340 
gonna cover it with some with the beads
okay<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.250> then<00:03:40.370> I'll<00:03:40.490> just<00:03:40.640> stick<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.090> right

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
okay and then I'll just stick it right

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.400 
okay and then I'll just stick it right
down<00:03:42.350> there<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:44.540> that's<00:03:44.720> looking<00:03:44.930> kind<00:03:45.350> of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
down there so that's looking kind of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.250 
down there so that's looking kind of
funky<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.040> then<00:03:46.670> I'm<00:03:47.060> gonna<00:03:47.270> just<00:03:47.570> clip<00:03:47.960> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
funky and then I'm gonna just clip the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.320 
funky and then I'm gonna just clip the
necklace

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.810 
measure it to the right size yeah we're
just<00:03:55.540> gonna<00:03:56.540> like<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.370> and<00:04:00.160> I'm<00:04:01.160> sorry<00:04:01.220> some

just gonna like that and I'm sorry some
glue<00:04:02.090> sticking<00:04:02.810> around<00:04:03.080> sticking<00:04:03.740> out<00:04:03.860> that's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
glue sticking around sticking out that's

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.350 
glue sticking around sticking out that's
gluing<00:04:04.460> it<00:04:04.580> down<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:04.970> we're<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:05.150> gonna

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
gluing it down so we're just gonna

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.790 
gluing it down so we're just gonna
quickly<00:04:06.400> depending<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:07.670> your<00:04:07.820> glue<00:04:08.060> gun<00:04:08.800> this

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
quickly depending on your glue gun this

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.590 
quickly depending on your glue gun this
is<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.010> really<00:04:10.340> hot<00:04:10.550> one<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.090> takes<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.420> little

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
is a really hot one so it takes a little

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.620 
is a really hot one so it takes a little
longer<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:12.260> have<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.410> little<00:04:12.620> more<00:04:13.150> time<00:04:14.150> to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
longer you have a little more time to

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.000 
longer you have a little more time to
get<00:04:14.750> things<00:04:15.050> together<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.590> some<00:04:15.770> of<00:04:15.890> the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
get things together but some of the

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.840 
get things together but some of the
cheaper<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:16.730> low-temperature<00:04:17.600> glue<00:04:18.049> guns

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
cheaper like low-temperature glue guns

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.460 
cheaper like low-temperature glue guns
they<00:04:19.850> dry<00:04:20.120> really<00:04:20.150> really<00:04:20.750> fast<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.230> have

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
they dry really really fast so you have

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.710 
they dry really really fast so you have
to<00:04:21.620> almost<00:04:21.859> do<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.100> in<00:04:22.250> stages<00:04:22.580> okay<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:23.390> there

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
to almost do it in stages okay so there

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.170 
to almost do it in stages okay so there
we've<00:04:23.870> got<00:04:24.050> our<00:04:24.170> little<00:04:24.850> embellishment<00:04:25.850> there

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
we've got our little embellishment there

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.990 
we've got our little embellishment there
with<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> beads<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.830> can<00:04:28.460> clean<00:04:28.700> up<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
with the beads you can clean up the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.570 
with the beads you can clean up the
little<00:04:29.210> strings<00:04:29.570> after<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.950> then<00:04:31.280> we're

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
little strings after and then we're

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.220 
little strings after and then we're
gonna<00:04:31.700> put<00:04:31.910> our<00:04:32.000> little<00:04:32.150> shamrock<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.960> there

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
gonna put our little shamrock on there

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.410 
gonna put our little shamrock on there
it<00:04:33.650> already<00:04:33.830> has<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.100> sticky<00:04:34.580> so<00:04:34.760> I'll<00:04:34.910> take<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
it already has a sticky so I'll take the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.680 
it already has a sticky so I'll take the
sticky<00:04:35.810> off<00:04:36.370> don't<00:04:37.370> need<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.120> just<00:04:38.450> put

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
sticky off don't need that and just put

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.060 
sticky off don't need that and just put
a<00:04:38.720> few<00:04:39.590> dabs<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.220> hot<00:04:40.490> glue<00:04:41.710> we're<00:04:42.710> gonna<00:04:42.860> make

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
a few dabs of hot glue we're gonna make

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.920 
a few dabs of hot glue we're gonna make
it<00:04:43.250> sure<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:43.850> right<00:04:44.150> on<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.420> front<00:04:44.660> there
