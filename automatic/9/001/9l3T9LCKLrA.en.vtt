00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.360
 Composting process is an iron process 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:12.330
 and as a constant presence of oxygen 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 natural, no chemicals are added or 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.859
 accelerator so a guaranteed 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.020
 sanitization of the final product by its 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.780
 phases of high internal temperature 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.240
 during the process resulting in the end 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.520
 a live restorative product 100 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.030
 beneficial microorganisms for the soil 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.460
 and the plants first step the material to 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.800
 compost pure manure from hens 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.399
 cage production the removed from the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.019
 warehouses by automated mechanisms 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 conveyor belts without so much 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.679
 collection among others that are 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.069
 installed so that no person 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.719
 have to perform manual labor 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.819
 directly with the manure the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.249
 material from there nasa 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.489
 when leaving the gal never directly to a 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.079
 automotive transportation system 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.199
 conditioning specifically for this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.199
 work 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.059
 Ticket storehouses of the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.340
 directly to the composting plant 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.710
 a specific area where the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.470
 mix with the material coal to the rich 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.110
 in cellulose and hemicellulose guaranteeing 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.820
 a homogenous and maddening mixture 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.740
 mix does not make it into carbon that is the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.140
 first condition for it to develop 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.300
 a good composting the carbon material 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 and cellulose rhythm allows the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.810
 growth and development of all 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.060
 bacteria needed for 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.830
 transformation of organic matter and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.290
 the stabilization of the different 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.960
 compounds of the final nitrogen material 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.940
 calcium phosphorus among others 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.250
 the calculated material also helps 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.410
 adjust the unit of the mixture to a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.070
 optimal level for a fast mini-line 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.070
 fermentation 55 to 60 degrees centigrade 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.640
 the mixture of hens coal material a 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.130
 2 and store in a protected area of ​​the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.500
 rain for a maximum time of 24 hours 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.640
 time in which a period starts 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.479
 fermentation 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.240
 internal natural increase associated with 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.319
 10 thermophilic microorganisms 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.970
 responsible for the first part of the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.250
 composting 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.110
 in passing the mixture is available in each 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.950
 of the corridors where the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 process of the sage group as such 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.580
 the composting machines are the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.000
 responsible for moving the material 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.250
 mixed at least once every 24 hours 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.099
 the machines move the material towards 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.989
 go inside the hall once what 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.420
 they mix again allowing the creation 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.519
 of all the mixture and put of the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.850
 oxygenation of the product what 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.040
 guarantees the aerobic process 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.070
 the operation of the machines to the material 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.800
 mixed is repeated for at least 45 days 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.810
 time in which the whole process occurs 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.490
 composting 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.770
 It is also possible to lower the humidity to 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.470
 minimum levels 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.000
 that guarantee the life of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.420
 microorganisms and the stability of 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.420
 nutrients 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.790
 make several measurements to the product 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.950
 which gives us an idea that the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.340
 process is being done correctly 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.739
 unit temperature oxygen level and ph 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.200
 the temperature report during 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.680
 different phases of the process is a fact 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.230
 very important because 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.780
 and the process is active and that is 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.870
 fulfilling its normal temperature cycle 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.659
 high at the beginning with peaks of 60 to 65 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.120
 degrees centigrade and then it descends 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:35.980
 gradually to finish at the end 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.959
 of the hallway with 38 to 40 degrees maximum 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.780
 When the product reaches the end of 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.150
 hall is desert after 45 days 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.310
 of composting this is carried to a 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.930
 greenhouse where skin has been shaped in the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.659
 entity 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.060
 the final stage is carried out ie the 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.550
 product stabilization 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.400
 and its regular 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.370
 at the optimal optimal levels 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.920
 commercialization 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.680
 and these physicists from one place to another according to 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.560
 the internal temperature and allowing a 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.989
 adequate aeration 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.739
 when we got the moisture poured in between 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.349
 18 and 22 the temperature stable and going 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.900
 by a sieving we proceed to perform 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.209
 packaging in double-cloth messages a 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.550
 inner impermeable polyethylene or 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.770
 external and polypropylene which 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.600
 protect the product from the conditions 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.150
 of the environment during its 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.120
 storage and allow them to preserve 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.800
 its chemical and physical properties 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.240
 initials during the time before being 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 used in the field
