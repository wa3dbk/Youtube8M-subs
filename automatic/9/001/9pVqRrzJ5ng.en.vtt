00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
looks like on the front and then you can

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.250 
looks like on the front and then you can

just turn it back and the really cool
thing<00:02:24.410> about<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.850> get<00:02:26.000> it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
thing about this is that you can get it

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.720 
thing about this is that you can get it
off<00:02:26.300> easily<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.920> what<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.220> would<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.580> like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
off easily so what you would do is like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.010 
off easily so what you would do is like
this<00:02:28.940> cuz<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.990> little<00:02:30.320> hook<00:02:30.500> right<00:02:30.980> here

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
this cuz of this little hook right here

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.530 
this cuz of this little hook right here
and<00:02:33.020> then<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.310> turn<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.700> vaccine<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.330> there

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
and then to turn this vaccine on there

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.090 
and then to turn this vaccine on there
what's<00:02:35.960> going<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:37.340> do<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
what's going to just do this and you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.960 
what's going to just do this and you
would<00:02:40.250> flip<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.180> right<00:02:41.690> here<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.580> you'll<00:02:43.760> give

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
would flip it right here and you'll give

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.120
