00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
different parts of your memory ok let

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
different parts of your memory ok let
your<00:02:07.350> different<00:02:07.710> hole<00:02:07.860> between<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.789> back

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
your different hole between like back

your different hole between like back
and<00:02:09.300> forth<00:02:09.509> between<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.869> memory<00:02:10.080> blocks<00:02:10.349> now

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
and forth between the memory blocks now

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.920 
and forth between the memory blocks now
that<00:02:10.920> think<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.489> memory<00:02:11.819> blocks<00:02:12.120> as
