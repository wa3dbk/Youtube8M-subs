I see the knee and and so part of what
we<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.970> always<00:02:30.320> say<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.380> ourselves

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
we have to do is always say to ourselves

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
have a basic basic safety net so that's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.330 
have a basic basic safety net so that's
point<00:02:39.300> number<00:02:39.420> two<00:02:39.920> point<00:02:40.920> number<00:02:41.100> three<00:02:41.540> is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
that the way insurance companies have

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.070 
that the way insurance companies have
been<00:02:49.320> operating<00:02:50.390> even<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.480> you've<00:02:51.630> got<00:02:51.840> health

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080

insurance<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:53.940> always<00:02:54.180> know<00:02:54.300> what<00:02:54.450> you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
insurance you don't always know what you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.420 
insurance you don't always know what you
got<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:57.390> what<00:02:57.630> has<00:02:58.500> been<00:02:58.800> increasingly

the<00:02:59.610> practice<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.650> you're<00:03:01.950> not<00:03:02.220> lucky

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the practice is that if you're not lucky

the practice is that if you're not lucky

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
enough to work for a big company that is

enough to work for a big company that is

a big pool this essentially is almost a

a big pool this essentially is almost a

you may be buying insurance you think
you're<00:03:14.730> covered<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:16.049> then<00:03:16.260> when<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.040> get

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
you're covered but then when you get

that<00:03:30.570> would<00:03:31.290> justify<00:03:31.709> them<00:03:32.130> cancelling<00:03:32.640> your

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
that would justify them cancelling your

that would justify them cancelling your
policy<00:03:33.260> or<00:03:34.260> there's<00:03:34.860> some<00:03:35.040> fine<00:03:35.250> print<00:03:35.549> in

there where you've got a lifetime limit
and<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.790> turns<00:03:39.000> out<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.329> thought<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.690> had

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and it turns out you thought you had

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.840 
and it turns out you thought you had
coverage<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> turns<00:03:41.310> out<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> coverage

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
coverage but it turns out the coverage

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.280 
coverage but it turns out the coverage
only<00:03:41.970> goes<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.600> certain<00:03:42.780> point<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.200> then

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
only goes up to a certain point and then

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.600 
only goes up to a certain point and then
afterwards<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.829> have<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.040> start<00:03:44.250> paying<00:03:44.400> out

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
afterwards you have to start paying out

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.190 
afterwards you have to start paying out
of<00:03:44.640> pocket<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:47.480> even<00:03:48.480> after<00:03:48.630> paying<00:03:49.019> all

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200

of pocket and even after paying all
those<00:03:49.380> premiums<00:03:49.799> you're<00:03:50.400> now<00:03:50.579> in<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.690> hole

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
those premiums you're now in the hole

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.180 
those premiums you're now in the hole
for<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.170> hundred<00:03:52.380> thousand<00:03:52.799> or<00:03:52.920> two<00:03:53.040> hundred

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
for a hundred thousand or two hundred

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.350 
for a hundred thousand or two hundred
thousand<00:03:53.579> dollars<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:54.060> you're<00:03:54.150> going

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
thousand dollars and you're going

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.740 
thousand dollars and you're going
bankrupt<00:03:54.540> you're<00:03:54.870> losing<00:03:55.140> your<00:03:55.260> house<00:03:55.380> and

bankrupt you're losing your house and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.970 
bankrupt you're losing your house and
the<00:03:57.750> final<00:03:58.170> point<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:59.239> that<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:01.140> cost<00:04:01.590> of

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
the final point is that the cost of

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.039 
the final point is that the cost of
health<00:04:02.220> care<00:04:02.310> send<00:04:03.060> us<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.360> anything<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:03.870> did

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
health care send us out anything we did

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.319 
health care send us out anything we did
in<00:04:04.200> reform<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.860> mean<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:05.880> just<00:04:06.030> allow<00:04:06.299> the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
in reform I mean we just allow the

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.930 
in reform I mean we just allow the
current<00:04:06.780> trajectory<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.350> go<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.920> out<00:04:08.910> of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
current trajectory to go on is out of

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.360 
current trajectory to go on is out of
control<00:04:09.320> now<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.350> haven't<00:04:10.590> talked<00:04:10.859> about<00:04:11.160> about

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
control now I haven't talked about about

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
what his costs are looking like for cell

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.770 
what his costs are looking like for cell
guard<00:04:14.100> employees<00:04:15.019> but<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.079> can<00:04:16.410> tell<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.680> that

health<00:04:18.780> care<00:04:19.190> costs<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:21.090> gone<00:04:21.120> up<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.959> price

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
health care costs have gone up the price

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.890 
health care costs have gone up the price
of<00:04:22.590> health<00:04:22.770> care<00:04:23.039> has<00:04:23.220> gone

of health care has gone

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.350 
of health care has gone
three<00:04:25.900> times<00:04:26.139> faster<00:04:26.620> than<00:04:26.740> wages<00:04:29.099> so<00:04:30.360> either

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
three times faster than wages so either

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.570

the company is having to swallow those

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.510 
the company is having to swallow those
costs<00:04:34.000> which<00:04:34.720> means<00:04:34.960> that's<00:04:35.229> less<00:04:35.530> money<00:04:35.560> that

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
costs which means that's less money that

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.089 
costs which means that's less money that

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
what we said is number one we'll have

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.379 
what we said is number one we'll have
the<00:05:23.979> basic<00:05:24.430> principle<00:05:24.849> that<00:05:24.940> everybody<00:05:25.330> gets

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
the basic principle that everybody gets

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.909 
the basic principle that everybody gets
covered<00:05:26.639> and<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:29.229> way<00:05:29.349> we're<00:05:29.560> going<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.740> do

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
covered and the way we're going to do

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.790 
covered and the way we're going to do
that<00:05:30.130> is<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:32.400> say<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:34.349> most<00:05:35.349> people

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
that is to say that most people

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.040 
that is to say that most people
individually<00:05:36.639> shouldn't<00:05:37.509> buy<00:05:37.659> health

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050

insurance<00:05:38.169> on<00:05:38.650> their<00:05:38.889> own<00:05:38.919> because<00:05:39.219> they<00:05:39.520> have

no leverage and the insurance companies
take<00:05:41.199> advantage<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:42.479> instead<00:05:43.479> what<00:05:43.719> we're

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
take advantage of instead what we're

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.850 
take advantage of instead what we're
going<00:05:43.960> to<00:05:44.050> do<00:05:44.110> is<00:05:44.199> we're<00:05:44.320> going<00:05:44.409> to<00:05:44.500> set<00:05:44.650> up<00:05:44.770> a
