00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.510

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.400

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.780
 now it takes quite 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.000
 and what caught my attention and then 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.000
 more I liked it was the embroidery that has 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.740
 I thought it was very pretty 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.000
 Second, I want to show you this 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.270
 exercise is to go what is very finite 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.149

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.239
 black and white and that of saiz then the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.550

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.990
 the effect it also does from behind 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:13.020
 It has a golden zipper 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.399

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.080
 and gray and a marble effect 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.500
 and has two pockets that stay like this 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.790
 sure many of you have seen 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.080
 They are a copy of the shoes 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.240

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.250

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.439

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.439
 inside it has a wedge more or less 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.680
 This is the wedge and they are very comfortable 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.960
 It seems a very nice footwear very comfortable 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.960

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.430
 golden that good gives a touch 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.890
 special and I'm in love with these 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.980

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.140
 is this little bag this is zara I 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.610
 I always tend to use huge bags 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.980

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.640

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.170
 Golden 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.170
 I think it had an acceptable size 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.700
 inside you have these spacers 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.290
 does not have until this few and good me 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.940
 It seemed very nice the next thing you 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.510
 I'm going to teach is a necklace 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.439

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.590

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.590
 Golden 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.120
 and has a chain like closing what 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.420
 next I 'm going to show you are about 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.640
 rings that I buy these rings two of 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.239
 they saw them last season in 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.370
 mango touch and I liked them a lot but 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.620
 It cost about fifteen euros and the truth 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 is that I did not decide to buy them and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.970
 When I was in Madrid, I went to the factory 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.159
 san sebastián de los reyes and when 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.739
 I went into mango and these rings that 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.569
 they were at 395 euros and I said this is the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.600
 mine 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.210
 and I'm going to show you this is the first 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.020
 It is a stone between pink and white 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.020
 restored 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.660
 in second ring at normal price I do not 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.220
 I would have bought it but with 395 me 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.130
 liked this is not gold is pink and the 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.660
 stone is green bottle green 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.660
 that this season is called a lot 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.450
 that was the day of the rings because 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.300
 When I started to dance well I saw her another 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.920
 ring he had also signed 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.160
 previously but I had not decided 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.070
 to buy and it was five euros so 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.160
 so much I took it is this I think it's from a 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.520
 collection that they were all stars of 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.350
 sea 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.900
 has two stones in blue 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.200
 and I think it's very nice I really like the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.810
 contrast between the golden train 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.300
 good and now finally I'm going to move on 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.070
 show you what I bought in vogue 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.410
 fashion night in madrid when I was in 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.280
 sephora I took advantage of 15% discount 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.940
 they did that night and I bought it 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.940
 metaphor 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.310
 I bought three water crims I'm going to 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.669
 teach the two tones for which you do not 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.259
 you know the waters of meca forever are 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.280
 some shades in cream that are 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.669
 water resistant 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.449
 this is the tone that I bought 16 is a 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.449
 pink champagne 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.959
 this is number 13 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.709
 it's also a champagne tone but that will go 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.709
 more to golden 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.259
 and this is number 2 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:30.949
 I think it's beautiful for this fall 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.749
 it's a tone between gray and purple I 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.789
 love the eco cream you can 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.519
 apply as a base in the eyeshadow 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.379
 whether you carry them alone or if you apply 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:43.189
 other eyeshadows above gives you 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:45.500
 a lovely effect then I went to the store 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:49.130
 of mac by carrey 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:52.000
 and I took a lipstick that for this 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.890
 autumn I like very much is the king of 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.480
 sure that many already know him is one 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.590
 of the most famous of mac I 'm going to 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.260
 teach I know that at first sight it gives a 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.630
 little scary can color but it's a 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.300
 precious tone the best thing of all is that 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.950
 depending how you apply it you can 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.200
 get different different results 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.910
 colors and that gives you a lot of play 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.400
 the tone is between violet and fuchsia 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.070
 I have not released it yet because I'm going to 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.740

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.690
