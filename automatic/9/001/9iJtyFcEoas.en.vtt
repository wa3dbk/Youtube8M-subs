hand<00:01:48.270> i'm<00:01:49.140> using<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> PDW<00:01:50.030> probably<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> best

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hand i'm using the PDW probably the best

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
hand i'm using the PDW probably the best
gun<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> game<00:01:51.930> overall<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> only<00:01:53.220> gun

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.469 
gun in the game overall on the only gun
i<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> little<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:54.060> better<00:01:54.240> than

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
i think it's a little bit better than

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
i think it's a little bit better than
this<00:01:54.600> weapon<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.380> MSMC<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.399> only

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this weapon is the MSMC but that's only

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.880 
this weapon is the MSMC but that's only
in<00:01:56.790> certain<00:01:57.030> concentrated<00:01:57.750> areas<00:01:58.110> anytime

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
in certain concentrated areas anytime

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.319 
in certain concentrated areas anytime
you're<00:01:59.009> running<00:01:59.310> into<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.549> map<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.060> plank

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you're running into a map out your plank

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.999 
you're running into a map out your plank
ground<00:02:00.570> war<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:01.020> domination<00:02:01.439> something<00:02:01.890> where

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
ground war or domination something where

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.139 
ground war or domination something where
you<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.369> where<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> spawns<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> be

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you know where the spawns going to be

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.550 
you know where the spawns going to be
located<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.630> you'll<00:02:03.750> easily<00:02:03.930> run<00:02:04.200> into<00:02:04.409> two<00:02:04.530> or
