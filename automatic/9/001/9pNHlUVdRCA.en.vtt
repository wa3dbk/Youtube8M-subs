00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

in<00:00:00.179> this<00:00:00.329> video<00:00:00.539> I'll<00:00:00.960> show<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.350> changes<00:00:01.740> for

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
in this video I'll show the changes for

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.280 
in this video I'll show the changes for
overgrowth<00:00:02.250> alpha<00:00:02.760> 1<00:00:02.939> 49<00:00:03.330> which<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:04.020> can<00:00:04.140> try

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
overgrowth alpha 1 49 which you can try

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.230 
overgrowth alpha 1 49 which you can try
if<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.500> pre-ordered<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.520> week<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:05.910> started

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
if you pre-ordered this week I started

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.179 
if you pre-ordered this week I started
by<00:00:06.390> adding<00:00:06.660> procedural<00:00:07.230> foot<00:00:07.440> movement<00:00:07.859> so

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
by adding procedural foot movement so

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.350 
by adding procedural foot movement so
characters<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.760> move<00:00:08.940> around<00:00:09.059> without

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
characters can move around without

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.330 
characters can move around without
leaving<00:00:09.719> their<00:00:09.929> fighting<00:00:10.139> stance<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:11.160> is

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
leaving their fighting stance this is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
leaving their fighting stance this is
really<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.610> cosmetic<00:00:12.120> effect<00:00:12.240> since<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
really a cosmetic effect since it

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.480 
really a cosmetic effect since it
doesn't<00:00:13.200> change<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.710> movement<00:00:13.860> speed<00:00:14.280> or<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
doesn't change the movement speed or the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.250 
doesn't change the movement speed or the
player<00:00:14.730> controls<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.900> helps<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
player controls but it helps the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.900 
player controls but it helps the
characters<00:00:16.619> look<00:00:16.800> more<00:00:17.010> focused<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> intense

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
characters look more focused and intense

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.450 
characters look more focused and intense
the<00:00:18.660> AI<00:00:18.810> characters<00:00:19.380> also<00:00:19.710> frequently<00:00:20.130> adjust

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the AI characters also frequently adjust

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.429 
the AI characters also frequently adjust
the<00:00:20.609> range<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.029> positioning<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> fights

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the range and positioning so the fights

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.380 
the range and positioning so the fights
are<00:00:22.590> more<00:00:22.619> active<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.250> dynamic<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:24.180> also

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
are more active and dynamic this also

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269 
are more active and dynamic this also
helps<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.869> group<00:00:25.050> encounters<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:26.160> they

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
helps with group encounters because they

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.560 
helps with group encounters because they
don't<00:00:26.460> always<00:00:26.609> attack<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> same<00:00:27.359> time

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
don't always attack at the same time

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.870 
don't always attack at the same time
anymore<00:00:27.900> they're<00:00:28.619> still<00:00:28.859> very<00:00:29.010> difficult<00:00:29.519> but

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
anymore they're still very difficult but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
anymore they're still very difficult but
not<00:00:30.000> quite<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.390> hard<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.689> my<00:00:30.869> work<00:00:31.019> before<00:00:31.219> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
not quite as hard as my work before the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.799 
not quite as hard as my work before the
procedural<00:00:32.730> foot<00:00:32.969> placement<00:00:33.450> still<00:00:33.630> needs

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
procedural foot placement still needs

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
procedural foot placement still needs
work<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.829> awkward<00:00:35.219> poses<00:00:35.430> but

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
work so there are some awkward poses but

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.639 
work so there are some awkward poses but
it's<00:00:36.480> enough<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> test<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> gameplay

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it's enough to test out the gameplay

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.540 
it's enough to test out the gameplay
implications<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> new<00:00:38.610> AI<00:00:38.820> movement<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
implications of the new AI movement I

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.160 
implications of the new AI movement I
also<00:00:41.550> worked<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.030> weapon<00:00:42.420> impact<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.989> more

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
also worked on weapon impact some more

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
also worked on weapon impact some more
now<00:00:43.590> they<00:00:43.770> use<00:00:43.890> different<00:00:44.040> sound<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
now they use different sound and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220 
now they use different sound and
particle<00:00:45.090> effects<00:00:45.360> depending<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.110> what

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
particle effects depending on what

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
particle effects depending on what
surfaces<00:00:46.710> collide<00:00:47.270> weapons<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.450> have

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
surfaces collide weapons can have

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.970 
surfaces collide weapons can have
different<00:00:48.840> materials<00:00:49.289> along<00:00:49.530> their<00:00:49.739> length

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
different materials along their length

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.680 
different materials along their length
so<00:00:50.430> spear<00:00:50.700> blade<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.180> made<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> metal

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so spear blade can be made of metal

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
so spear blade can be made of metal
while<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> rest<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> made<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> wood<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:54.149> bins

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
while the rest is made of wood what bins

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
while the rest is made of wood what bins
also<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.780> blood<00:00:54.989> stuck<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.620> they

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
also get blood stuck to them when they

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
also get blood stuck to them when they
cut<00:00:55.860> flesh<00:00:56.129> which<00:00:56.520> gets<00:00:56.760> smeared<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
cut flesh which gets smeared out in the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
cut flesh which gets smeared out in the
direction<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> cut<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> started

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
direction of the cut at first I started

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
direction of the cut at first I started
by<00:00:59.820> using<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> same<00:01:00.300> effect<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> dripping

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
by using the same effect as the dripping

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
by using the same effect as the dripping
character<00:01:02.010> blood<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.149> look

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
character blood but that didn't look

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.780 
character blood but that didn't look
right<00:01:03.650> it<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:04.799> looked<00:01:05.159> more<00:01:05.339> believable

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
right it actually looked more believable

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
right it actually looked more believable
to<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.090> no<00:01:06.240> animation<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> see

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to have no animation at all like you see

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
to have no animation at all like you see
here<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.180> might<00:01:09.180> add<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.630> subtle<00:01:09.840> dripping

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
here I might add a more subtle dripping

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
here I might add a more subtle dripping
animation<00:01:10.770> later<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.460> make<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> look<00:01:11.850> less

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
animation later to make it look less

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.850 
animation later to make it look less
static<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> works<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.740> well

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
static but I think it works pretty well

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.780 
static but I think it works pretty well
for<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:16.070> started<00:01:17.070> working<00:01:17.310> towards

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
for now I started working towards

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.640 
for now I started working towards
stealth<00:01:18.060> mechanics<00:01:18.600> by<00:01:18.990> adding<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.320> startled

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
stealth mechanics by adding a startled

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
stealth mechanics by adding a startled
period<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.340> enemies<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:20.970> noticed<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
period when enemies first noticed the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
period when enemies first noticed the
player<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:22.140> freeze<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> second

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
player they freeze up for about a second

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
player they freeze up for about a second
before<00:01:23.430> acting<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> give<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> free

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
before acting which can give you a free

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
before acting which can give you a free
unblocked<00:01:25.590> hit<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.979> you're<00:01:26.100> fast<00:01:26.310> enough<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
unblocked hit if you're fast enough I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
unblocked hit if you're fast enough I
also<00:01:27.240> changed<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> sound<00:01:28.080> notification

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
also changed the sound notification

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
also changed the sound notification
system<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.640> better<00:01:29.820> control<00:01:30.090> over<00:01:30.270> how

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
system to have better control over how

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.420 
system to have better control over how
far<00:01:30.869> sound<00:01:31.140> travels<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> how<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.400> each

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
far sound travels and how well each

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.880 
far sound travels and how well each
character<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.090> hear<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.259> rabbits<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.740> hear

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
character can hear the rabbits can hear
