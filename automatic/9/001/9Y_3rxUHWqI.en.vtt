00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
mode if you just flip over the fusion

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.530 
mode if you just flip over the fusion
wheel<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.990> attack<00:01:40.530> mode

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
wheel so right now it is in attack mode

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
wheel so right now it is in attack mode
very<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:42.899> shiny<00:01:43.170> wheel<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> DD<00:01:49.610> DD

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
very very shiny wheel and this is DD DD

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.069 
very very shiny wheel and this is DD DD
for<00:01:51.000> bearing<00:01:51.420> drive<00:01:53.600> alright<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.810> let's<00:01:54.990> take

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
for bearing drive alright so let's take

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:06.970 
for bearing drive alright so let's take
it<00:01:55.200> apart<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> put<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.790> stamina<00:01:57.509> mode

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.260 

so<00:02:07.980> you<00:02:08.100> take<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.550> bottom<00:02:08.880> piece<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.240> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
so you take this bottom piece out and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.050 
so you take this bottom piece out and
it's<00:02:09.570> kind<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.840> fits<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.160> snugly<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.850> there

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
it's kind of fits really snugly in there

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.500 
it's kind of fits really snugly in there
so<00:02:12.330> take<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.590> out<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.180> put<00:02:15.390> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so take this out and then you put this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.370 
so take this out and then you put this
on<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> top<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:20.250> find<00:02:20.520> over<00:02:20.880> here<00:02:20.910> goes

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.250 

yeah<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.770> very<00:02:26.040> snug<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:29.870> okay<00:02:30.870> there<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
yeah if it's very snug so okay there you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
yeah if it's very snug so okay there you
go<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.630> would<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.820> stamina<00:02:35.820> mode<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.120> think

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
go so this would be stamina mode I think

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.240 
go so this would be stamina mode I think
that's<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> says<00:02:36.900> according<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's what it says according to the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.370 
that's what it says according to the
hazard<00:02:39.210> instructions<00:02:42.050> bitching<00:02:43.050> yeah<00:02:43.170> let's

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
hazard instructions bitching yeah let's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.520 
hazard instructions bitching yeah let's
take<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.670> take<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.760> apart<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.360> let's<00:02:46.050> take<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
take a take it apart and let's take a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
take a take it apart and let's take a
look<00:02:46.710> at<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> metal<00:02:47.850> wheel<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.210> little<00:02:48.240> bit

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
look at the metal wheel a little bit

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.890 
look at the metal wheel a little bit
closer<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:50.910> cool<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.480> shiny

nice and graving on this bottom part and
then<00:02:57.390> here's<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.780> top<00:02:57.990> part<00:02:58.260> where<00:02:59.040> there's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
then here's the top part where there's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.960 
then here's the top part where there's
kind<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> face<00:03:00.440> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> middle<00:03:01.890> wheel

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.940 

really<00:03:05.970> good<00:03:06.240> stamina<00:03:06.510> wheel<00:03:07.110> by<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.350> way<00:03:07.530> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
really good stamina wheel by the way and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.800 
really good stamina wheel by the way and
then<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:10.140> two<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:12.060> clew<00:03:12.300> wheel<00:03:12.540> or<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
then the two the clew wheel or the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:21.830 
then the two the clew wheel or the
energy<00:03:13.020> ring<00:03:14.270> my<00:03:15.270> phone's<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.930> off<00:03:20.660> okay

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
energy ring my phone's going off okay

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.460 
energy ring my phone's going off okay
anyway<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:24.150> would<00:03:24.330> be<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.780> PC<00:03:25.170> frame

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
anyway this would be like the PC frame

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.470 
anyway this would be like the PC frame
in<00:03:25.980> terms<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:27.060> original<00:03:27.380> Takara<00:03:28.380> Tomy<00:03:28.410> one

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
in terms of the original Takara Tomy one

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.280 
in terms of the original Takara Tomy one
and<00:03:30.480> then<00:03:30.959> BD<00:03:31.260> bearing<00:03:31.950> drive<00:03:35.870> there's<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.959> free

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and then BD bearing drive there's a free

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.460 
and then BD bearing drive there's a free
spinning<00:03:37.650> bearing<00:03:38.340> inside<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.470> alright

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
spinning bearing inside there alright

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.030 
spinning bearing inside there alright
and<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:41.580> do<00:03:41.640> have<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.470> Stono<00:03:43.770> Kong

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
and I do have the I have the Stono Kong

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.310 
and I do have the I have the Stono Kong
version<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.600> isn't<00:03:45.750> spin<00:03:46.170> as<00:03:46.320> well<00:03:48.320> but

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
version and it isn't spin as well but

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.050 
version and it isn't spin as well but
you<00:03:49.410> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.070> actually<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.610> one<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:50.880> a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
you can see so actually this one is a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.810 
you can see so actually this one is a
lot<00:03:51.239> better<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.250> believe<00:03:53.610> they're

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
lot better and I believe they're

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.890 
lot better and I believe they're
basically<00:03:54.239> much<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.810> same<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:57.420> judging

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
basically much the same just judging

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.810 
basically much the same just judging
judging<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.830> right<00:03:58.980> now<00:03:59.100> there's<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.550> not

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
judging it right now there's really not

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.770 
judging it right now there's really not
much<00:04:00.030> difference

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
much difference

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.780 
much difference
well<00:04:01.350> besides<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.890> faceball<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.700> course

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
well besides like faceball of course

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.380 
well besides like faceball of course
only<00:04:05.790> not<00:04:06.000> much<00:04:06.150> difference<00:04:08.870> maybe<00:04:09.870> even<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
only not much difference maybe even the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.640 
only not much difference maybe even the
clear<00:04:12.390> wheels<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.020> little<00:04:13.170> bit<00:04:13.260> different

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
clear wheels just a little bit different

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.699 
clear wheels just a little bit different
color<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.940> metal<00:04:15.600> powder

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
color the metal powder

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.069 
color the metal powder
easily<00:04:17.009> but<00:04:17.609> everything<00:04:18.299> else<00:04:18.449> seems<00:04:18.780> pretty

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
easily but everything else seems pretty

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.259 
easily but everything else seems pretty
much<00:04:19.319> the<00:04:19.530> same<00:04:19.739> especially<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> metal

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
much the same especially in the metal

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.999 
much the same especially in the metal
wheels<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.840> know<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.590> one's<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.830> little<00:04:22.889> bit

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
wheels I know this one's a little bit

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.640 
wheels I know this one's a little bit
dirtier<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.490> whatever<00:04:27.110> don't<00:04:28.110> we<00:04:28.229> see<00:04:28.500> any

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
dirtier but whatever don't we see any

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.580 
dirtier but whatever don't we see any
mole<00:04:28.919> differences<00:04:29.490> or<00:04:29.639> anything<00:04:30.169> they<00:04:31.169> pretty

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
mole differences or anything they pretty

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.200
