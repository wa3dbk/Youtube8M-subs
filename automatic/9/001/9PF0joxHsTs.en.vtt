00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:10.590
 Yes that's why there are no piano chords in the piano course 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.780
 That means today 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.240
 Well about the relationship between melody and accompaniment 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.600
 I would like to briefly describe Melo Lee Well, a variety that 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.900
 It's part of the turn on the main melody 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:33.070
 We are when we listen to music 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.860
 I listened to it once and remembered 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.260
 The Tteyuu what remains in the head 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.260
 In most cases, something 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.740
 Melody rust melody 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.220
 Not limited to that that if I Well of course is often or was 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:59.130
 In the intro part of the intro part Maa Phrase and mother of course there has been a head 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.780
 Do you have a lift or something like that in your mind? 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.770
 Essentially the most impressive 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:09.280
 It is a melody 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.280
 I think that 's a catchy music though 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.720
 Such melodrand and after 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.659
 Accompaniment that supports it 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.830
 This now 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.830
 I'm doing it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.530
 Hmm 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:35.290
 A chord is two or more sounds coming out at the same time 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:36.610
 Keep and what are home as well basic form to keep the three man in the form of between basic of Mako 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.550
 wh 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.350
 If two or more sounds are called at the same time, it is said to be a chord 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.800
 Though I think that it is good 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.790
 When this becomes an accompaniment part 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.350
 I mean 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.440
 Well harmony of minute but you what I described that Hamor 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:02.150
 Cancer or it is, for example, this is this is real that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.150
 uh not 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 me 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.390
 It is easy to protect Ms. Ms. store partner who is doing the same as for example in action 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.480
 For example, the main melody is 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:28.930
 If it were 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:33.990
 If this comes with the next fish in three times above 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.670
 With book and Hamor fee sand on top of the mountain 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.530
 me 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.160
 me 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.560
 me 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.110
 I like this Harm meat and what kind of tempo of whether What does rhythm after 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.480
 It is the book of Vance to carry 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.099
 This at altitude 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.099
 Go and 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.829
 Melody This is a turn of a melody or still four wheels 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.950
 Or something 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.760
 Of course with that piano 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.180
 With melody 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.319
 motto 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.080
 You can do the purse at the same time 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:19.330
 In that case 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:21.400
 In person or Well that such a shape right hand Well the Merori drew code do with the left 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:28.599
 If you can express 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 That is to say, what I teach most about that day's Terakoya in that composition class is 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.890
 Though it is piano play talk 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.319
 In that case 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.920
 With both hands 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.920
 Rhythm and 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.430
 Playing a chord code 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:51.500
 Singing melodies in the mouth No matter what the voices of human beings are good or bad 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.670
 The power of voice is so big 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.760
 Because you overdo it 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:03.760
 Rather than playing a difficult and confusing melody with your right hand 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.750
 Carried out firmly accompaniment with both hands 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:13.910
 It's a shame to sing with your own voice 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:18.160
 I is the most from that I So piano playing talking I like 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.630
 I have come and taught me again 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.470
 By say 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.780
 Also for example 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.900
 If you try 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:39.880
 Well cherry sheets flower of life during the 4 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.880
 In this case, the left is often mostly the root of the root of the lowest sound 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
 ni 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.350
 me 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.360
 me 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.969
 me 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.670
 me 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.520
 Yup 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.990
 Putsu 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.880
 As you say on the floor, if you're talking now, it's completely out of range 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.600
 I not would be able to do that but did you say melody that sang a whim while playing 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.830
 is 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:17.810
 Already now 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.810
 It means that you compose as well playing and acting properly 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.460
 Such Fu to that 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.460
 The code is so great 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.660
 It is essential to make a song, and the rest is the same 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.180
 In code progression 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:42.400
 Tteyuu it becomes a different song if Kaware are various melody 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:46.110
 There is today but it is a point want to say it was this your story 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.110
 Let's meet again next time in love
