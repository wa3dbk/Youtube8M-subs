00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:17.710
 the cure of a paralytic one day jesus 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:21.640
 was teaching and some Pharisees and 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 some masters of the law were sitting 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.529
 near him 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.349
 they had come from all ages of the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.580
 galilee and of the Jews and also 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 Jerusalem 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:39.370
 everybody wanted to hear the word of god 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.890
 The Lord's power was with Jesus to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.230
 that he should seek the sick and some 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:50.020
 men brought people who could not 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.130
 can not send people who could not 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.550
 talk and jesus healed the house was 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.400
 completely filled with people not 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.930
 There was more room for no one to enter. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.550
 inside the house 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:10.330
 some men brought paralytic 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:14.050
 lying on a bed they liked his 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.380
 friend and wanted Jesus to heal then 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:28.000
 they had an idea they got a 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:30.300
 ladder and decided to raise the man to the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.300
 roof 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.050
 the friends of the paralytic rose in the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.360
 roof 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.930
 removed the tiles and resolved to download 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:53.480
 your friend in your bed as far as jesus 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:57.380
 was Jesus seeing such faith 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:02.330
 men, my son said, your sins 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.780
 the Pharisees who 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.560
 They were very close by. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.600
 and they said who is this man they like 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.200
 love against god in this way 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.830
 no one can forgive sins only god has 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.830
 that power 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.850
 but Jesus knew what these men 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.750
 were thinking and said you are 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.780
 thinking thus what is easier said 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.640
 to the paralytic his sins are 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:45.260
 forgive or get up take your bed 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.870
 and then I'll show you what 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 I the Son of Man has power on earth. 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.010
 to forgive sins 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.910
 Then I said to the paralytic I say you 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.140
 stand up take your mat and go to 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.180
 your home 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:12.459
 and at that very moment the paralytic 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:17.480
 rose and began to praise the gore 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:20.300
 nenuma baby now and people were 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.540
 admired all looking that was a 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:29.200
 paralytic for so many years without walking 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.200
 your bed and went home praising God 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.860
 corot the same line since it is very bad 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.780
 Jesus wants to help other people 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.980
 it will also help you to do this is 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.980
