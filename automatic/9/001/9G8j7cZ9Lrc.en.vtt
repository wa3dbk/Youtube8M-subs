can understand that if this hurricane
decides<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.949> change<00:00:32.160> track<00:00:32.809> we<00:00:33.809> will<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
decides to change track we will have a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.819 
decides to change track we will have a
very<00:00:34.820> short<00:00:35.820> span<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.350> evacuation<00:00:37.350> time<00:00:37.590> and

very short span of evacuation time and
so<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.210> always<00:00:39.390> better<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.170> people

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so it's always better if our people

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
so it's always better if our people
evacuate<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.370> early<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.030> started

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
coast of nicaragua it could bounce and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.560 
coast of nicaragua it could bounce and
you<00:03:03.100> know<00:03:03.190> just<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.610> Dean<00:03:03.880> bounced<00:03:04.390> off

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
you know just like Dean bounced off

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.290 
you know just like Dean bounced off
Jamaica<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:06.280> could<00:03:06.580> bounce<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.150> could

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
Jamaica this could bounce and it could

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.480 
Jamaica this could bounce and it could
bounce<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.810> different<00:03:08.230> direction<00:03:08.490> because

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
bounce in a different direction because

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.060 
bounce in a different direction because
it's<00:03:09.880> more<00:03:10.060> favourable<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.140> warm<00:03:11.740> sea

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
it's more favourable to go to warm sea

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.090

than<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.400> go<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.610> land<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:14.410> all<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.830> other

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
than to go to land and all the other

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.080 
than to go to land and all the other
currents<00:03:15.700> around<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:16.210> it<00:03:17.110> just<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.800> can't<00:03:18.550> let

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
currents around it it just I can't let

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.720 
currents around it it just I can't let
my<00:03:19.300> guard<00:03:19.540> down<00:03:19.660> I'm<00:03:20.320> just<00:03:20.710> praying<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.310> mean

people to be safe so I'm just hoping
that<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.100> doesn't<00:03:30.130> change<00:03:30.610> directions<00:03:31.120> once

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
that it doesn't change directions once

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.100 
that it doesn't change directions once
it's<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.530> no<00:03:32.710> Nicaraguan<00:03:33.490> coastline

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
it's that no Nicaraguan coastline

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.960 
it's that no Nicaraguan coastline
absolutely<00:03:35.110> any<00:03:35.380> idea<00:03:35.680> when<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.430> will<00:03:36.550> or

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
absolutely any idea when you will or

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
people will halt evacuations that will

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.370 
people will halt evacuations that will
just<00:03:39.850> depend<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:40.300> when<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.570> Seas<00:03:40.780> get<00:03:40.990> choppy

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
just depend on when the Seas get choppy

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.650 
just depend on when the Seas get choppy
and<00:03:41.530> when<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.310> win<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.670> weather<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.390> winds

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
and when you win the weather the winds

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.070 
and when you win the weather the winds
pick<00:03:44.050> up<00:03:44.170> yeah<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:45.100> stop<00:03:45.790> our<00:03:46.120> air<00:03:46.420> evacuation

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
pick up yeah we stop our air evacuation

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.290 
pick up yeah we stop our air evacuation
