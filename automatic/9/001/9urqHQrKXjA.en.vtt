00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.969

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.510
 you know what can happen in a minute 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.750
 you will see that there is a step of being 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.940
 of mourning goodbye daily enough cups 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.980

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.800
 of his teeth but the police come to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.800
 late as always the same when the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.199
 different endings is the ideal landscape 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.390

 that you've never seen, maybe it's something 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 normal for the eyes of a taxi driver the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 second person becomes a diva before the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.629
 night it is very difficult to overcome the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.820
 expectation because she knows a lot about 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.010
 attractive women exchanges 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 saliva and hyperactive jaws 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 when he does not seek the love of all life 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.280
 and only finds outlets others tend to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 call frenzy 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.790
 he wants to move like shakira but he is not 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.820
 shakira although she thinks that if nobody 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.930
 know how it will end 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.140
 at night wake up no watch the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.300
 stop and the night 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.770
 and nobody knows how it will end 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.770

 satan as the bank always wins and the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.950
 reason becomes not stripe dancing 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.320
 about their mistakes they want to feel better 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.720
 rather feel better I can listen 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.700
 a car race burning wheel and 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 next to a guard rails and a crown of 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.649
 flowers the murias knows of shadows and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.110

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.600
 looks of men knows that the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.180
 brave people fill cemeteries and that 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.460

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.270
 they're just looking for your comfort while 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.970
 others have dreams under the duvet their 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.540
