you have to do is just maybe take off

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.560 
you have to do is just maybe take off
these<00:00:42.620> little<00:00:42.739> strings<00:00:43.219> really<00:00:44.030> carefully

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
these little strings really carefully

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.660 
these little strings really carefully
just<00:00:44.719> snip<00:00:44.960> them<00:00:45.140> off<00:00:45.309> now<00:00:46.309> if<00:00:46.399> you're<00:00:46.519> gonna

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670

roast this in the oven you can leave

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.470 
roast this in the oven you can leave
them<00:00:48.379> on<00:00:48.620> because<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:49.519> helps<00:00:49.789> keep<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.059> roast

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
them on because it helps keep the roast

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.959 
them on because it helps keep the roast
in<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.839> uniform<00:00:51.410> piece<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.219> nice<00:00:52.339> and<00:00:52.550> compact

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
in a uniform piece and nice and compact

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.149 
in a uniform piece and nice and compact
so<00:00:53.809> just<00:00:53.989> pull<00:00:54.199> these<00:00:54.350> little<00:00:54.469> guys<00:00:54.739> off<00:00:55.690> and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
so just pull these little guys off and

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.319 
so just pull these little guys off and
then<00:00:58.159> we're<00:00:58.309> gonna<00:00:58.399> cut<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.699> up<00:00:58.819> into<00:00:59.120> chunks

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
then we're gonna cut it up into chunks

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.239 
then we're gonna cut it up into chunks
now<00:00:59.870> as<00:01:00.019> you'll<00:01:00.230> see<00:01:00.499> there's<00:01:00.710> very<00:01:01.039> little

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
now as you'll see there's very little

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.329 
now as you'll see there's very little
fat<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:01.609> here<00:01:01.999> so<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:02.899> requires<00:01:03.339> marinating

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
fat in here so this requires marinating

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.670 
fat in here so this requires marinating
or<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.580> long<00:01:05.030> cooking<00:01:05.420> time<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:05.689> what<00:01:06.560> we're

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
or a long cooking time so what we're

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.319 
or a long cooking time so what we're
going<00:01:06.829> to<00:01:06.890> do<00:01:07.040> today<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.520> make<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.759> stew<00:01:08.090> out<00:01:08.240> of

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
going to do today is make a stew out of

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.600 
going to do today is make a stew out of
it<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:09.200> will<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.500> long<00:01:09.829> cooking<00:01:10.280> method

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
it so this will be a long cooking method

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.429 
it so this will be a long cooking method
with<00:01:10.850> some<00:01:11.119> moisture<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.990> we're<00:01:12.140> gonna<00:01:12.229> make

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
with some moisture so we're gonna make

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.039 
with some moisture so we're gonna make
this<00:01:12.649> into<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:13.220> really<00:01:13.520> really<00:01:13.850> tender<00:01:14.329> piece

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
this into a really really tender piece

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.080 
this into a really really tender piece
of<00:01:15.079> meat<00:01:15.290> now<00:01:16.219> you<00:01:16.280> can<00:01:16.490> just<00:01:16.579> cut<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:16.939> into

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
of meat now you can just cut it into

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.510 
of meat now you can just cut it into
probably<00:01:17.509> about<00:01:17.750> half<00:01:17.960> inch<00:01:18.229> chunks<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.920> good

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
probably about half inch chunks is good

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.289 
probably about half inch chunks is good

for your stew I like big cuts of beef in
my<00:01:23.450> stew<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:24.020> think<00:01:24.290> it's<00:01:24.770> looks<00:01:25.579> really<00:01:25.880> nice

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.050 
my stew I think it's looks really nice
and<00:01:27.250> because<00:01:28.250> we're<00:01:28.399> gonna<00:01:28.490> cook<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.820> for<00:01:28.880> a

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
and because we're gonna cook it for a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.020 
and because we're gonna cook it for a
long<00:01:29.270> time<00:01:29.829> you'll<00:01:30.829> get<00:01:31.100> kind<00:01:31.549> of<00:01:31.670> fall<00:01:31.880> they

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
long time you'll get kind of fall they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.760 
long time you'll get kind of fall they
fall<00:01:32.060> apart<00:01:32.539> a<00:01:32.659> little<00:01:32.750> bit<00:01:32.960> sometimes<00:01:33.200> so

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
fall apart a little bit sometimes so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.039 
fall apart a little bit sometimes so
you'll<00:01:34.280> still<00:01:34.520> be<00:01:34.670> able<00:01:34.789> to<00:01:35.000> see<00:01:35.240> them<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:35.689> the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
you'll still be able to see them in the

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.819 
you'll still be able to see them in the
stew<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.930> careful<00:01:39.259> once<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:39.530> get<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
stew and be careful once you get to the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.469 
stew and be careful once you get to the
end<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.549> course<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:40.969> a<00:01:41.060> little<00:01:41.180> bit

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
end because of course it's a little bit

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.349 
end because of course it's a little bit
a<00:01:41.780> little<00:01:42.049> bit<00:01:42.229> flimsy<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.030> want<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:44.210> try

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
a little bit flimsy and you want to try

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.240 
a little bit flimsy and you want to try
to<00:01:44.420> cut<00:01:44.630> them<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.960> uniform<00:01:45.469> pieces<00:01:45.710> they<00:01:46.100> don't

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
to cut them in uniform pieces they don't

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.359 
to cut them in uniform pieces they don't
have<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.640> be<00:01:46.869> absolutely<00:01:47.869> perfect<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.799> you

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
have to be absolutely perfect but you

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.380 
have to be absolutely perfect but you
know<00:01:49.460> try<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.759> make<00:01:49.939> sure<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.240> they're

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
know try and make sure that they're

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.730 
know try and make sure that they're
about<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.630> same<00:01:50.810> size<00:01:51.079> that<00:01:51.109> way<00:01:51.500> they'll

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
about the same size that way they'll

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.240 
about the same size that way they'll
cook<00:01:51.770> at<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.219> same<00:01:52.399> time<00:01:52.719> so<00:01:53.770> let's<00:01:54.770> cut<00:01:55.009> this

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
cook at the same time so let's cut this

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.210 
cook at the same time so let's cut this
a<00:01:56.020> couple<00:01:57.020> pieces<00:01:58.149> bass<00:01:59.149> big<00:01:59.390> chunks

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.000 

now<00:02:03.220> if<00:02:03.370> you<00:02:03.490> wanted<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.390> could<00:02:04.540> also

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
now if you wanted to you could also

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.380 
now if you wanted to you could also
marinate<00:02:06.010> this<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:09.790> could<00:02:09.910> use<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.300> a

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
marinate this and you could use it in a

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.320 
marinate this and you could use it in a
stir-fry<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.610> would<00:02:12.760> maybe<00:02:12.910> cut<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.210> a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
stir-fry but I would maybe cut it a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.560 
stir-fry but I would maybe cut it a
little<00:02:13.360> bit<00:02:13.570> thinner<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.020> nice<00:02:14.230> thin<00:02:14.560> pieces
