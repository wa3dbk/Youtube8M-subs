00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
now we're gonna go over the endocrine

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.280 
now we're gonna go over the endocrine
organs<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.620> cat<00:00:05.450> all<00:00:06.450> right<00:00:06.660> if<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.080> look

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
organs on the cat all right if we look

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.400 
organs on the cat all right if we look
we<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.620> see<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.069> heart<00:00:08.599> above<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.870> heart<00:00:10.110> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
we can see the heart above the heart is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.060 
we can see the heart above the heart is
the<00:00:10.889> thymus<00:00:11.900> notice<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.080> has<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.290> glandular

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the thymus notice it has the glandular

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.620 
the thymus notice it has the glandular
tissue<00:00:16.310> now<00:00:17.310> remember<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> thymus<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
tissue now remember the thymus is one of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
tissue now remember the thymus is one of
the<00:00:18.690> organs<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.260> will<00:00:19.470> shrink<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.250> older<00:00:20.609> we

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the organs that will shrink the older we

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.430 
the organs that will shrink the older we
get<00:00:21.439> from<00:00:22.439> there<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.760> pancreas

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.250 

and<00:00:27.530> the<00:00:28.100> pancreas<00:00:28.640> again<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.300> gland<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.170> it

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
and the pancreas again is a gland so it

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.450 
and the pancreas again is a gland so it
has<00:00:30.440> this<00:00:30.620> bumpy<00:00:31.130> or<00:00:31.310> mottled<00:00:32.029> texture<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.990> it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
has this bumpy or mottled texture to it

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.830 
has this bumpy or mottled texture to it
disregard<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.580> color<00:00:34.820> that's<00:00:35.240> part<00:00:35.630> of<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
disregard the color that's part of the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.620 
disregard the color that's part of the
latex<00:00:36.740> that<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:37.250> excuse<00:00:37.940> me<00:00:38.060> the<00:00:38.180> silicone

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
latex that we excuse me the silicone

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.090 
latex that we excuse me the silicone
that<00:00:38.660> we<00:00:38.900> inject<00:00:39.230> them<00:00:39.410> with<00:00:41.260> then<00:00:42.260> we<00:00:42.770> can<00:00:42.950> go

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
that we inject them with then we can go

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.290 
that we inject them with then we can go
down<00:00:44.080> find<00:00:45.080> the<00:00:45.170> fallopian<00:00:45.500> tube<00:00:45.980> at<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.000> end

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
down find the fallopian tube at the end

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600 
down find the fallopian tube at the end
of<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.540> fallopian<00:00:47.750> tube<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:49.190> can<00:00:49.220> see<00:00:49.489> this

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
of the fallopian tube you can see this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.640 
of the fallopian tube you can see this
small<00:00:49.790> ovary<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.670> then<00:00:53.090> on<00:00:53.270> this<00:00:53.629> young<00:00:54.140> lady

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
small ovary and then on this young lady

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.369 
small ovary and then on this young lady
see<00:00:55.430> all<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.910> glandular<00:00:56.270> tissue<00:00:56.690> again<00:00:57.290> you

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
see all this glandular tissue again you

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.960 
see all this glandular tissue again you
get<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.530> better<00:00:57.770> representation<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.910> that

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
get a better representation of that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.770 
get a better representation of that
modeling<00:00:59.659> and<00:00:59.980> this<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.280> mammary<00:01:01.850> tissue<00:01:02.300> or

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
modeling and this is mammary tissue or

modeling and this is mammary tissue or
mammary<00:01:03.050> gland<00:01:04.780> now<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:05.930> we<00:01:06.110> move<00:01:06.320> over<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:07.220> the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
mammary gland now if we move over to the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.780 
mammary gland now if we move over to the
male<00:01:07.700> cat<00:01:09.400> we<00:01:10.400> can<00:01:10.610> see<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.060> testee<00:01:12.729> now<00:01:13.729> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
male cat we can see the testee now the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.370 
male cat we can see the testee now the
testee<00:01:14.210> i'm<00:01:14.270> holding<00:01:14.690> has<00:01:14.810> been<00:01:14.990> removed<00:01:15.229> from

the scrotum the scrotum on the left is
covering<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.400> left<00:01:19.610> teste<00:01:20.500> then<00:01:21.500> we<00:01:21.680> can<00:01:21.890> come

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
covering the left teste then we can come

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.860 
covering the left teste then we can come
up<00:01:22.370> and<00:01:23.110> look<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.350> his<00:01:24.740> pancreas<00:01:25.450> his<00:01:26.450> pancreas

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
up and look at his pancreas his pancreas

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.570 
up and look at his pancreas his pancreas
is<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> little<00:01:27.650> more<00:01:27.770> typical<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.370> what<00:01:28.549> a

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
is a little more typical of what a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.789 
is a little more typical of what a
pancreas<00:01:29.060> looks<00:01:29.360> like<00:01:29.570> looks<00:01:30.320> very<00:01:30.530> similar

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
pancreas looks like looks very similar

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.970 
pancreas looks like looks very similar
to<00:01:30.950> roast<00:01:31.370> beef<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:32.750> not<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.170> tube<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.740> tube

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
to roast beef it's not the tube the tube

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.670 
to roast beef it's not the tube the tube
is<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.430> duodenum<00:01:34.760> it's<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:36.020> brown<00:01:36.500> area

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.130 

on<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:42.550> cap<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:44.020> have<00:01:44.050> removed<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.950> thymus

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
on this cap we have removed the thymus

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.840 
on this cap we have removed the thymus
to<00:01:47.140> be<00:01:47.260> able<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.530> locate<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.220> blood<00:01:48.430> vessels

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
to be able to locate the blood vessels

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.390 
to be able to locate the blood vessels
underneath<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.620> can<00:01:50.830> be<00:01:50.980> used<00:01:51.220> as<00:01:51.340> a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
underneath but this can be used as a

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.430 
underneath but this can be used as a
reference<00:01:51.910> point<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.750> can<00:01:52.900> see<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.200> heart

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
reference point you can see the heart

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.240 
reference point you can see the heart
and<00:01:53.770> then<00:01:54.280> above<00:01:54.550> it<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:55.810> be<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.230> thymus<00:01:56.500> so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
and then above it would be the thymus so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.920 
and then above it would be the thymus so
if<00:01:57.370> we<00:01:57.490> go<00:01:57.640> back<00:01:57.670> now<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.330> look<00:01:58.480> at<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.720> cat

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
if we go back now and look at the cat

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.080 
if we go back now and look at the cat
with<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.500> thymus<00:02:01.560> over<00:02:02.560> here<00:02:03.130> there's<00:02:03.850> my

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
with the thymus over here there's my

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.680 
with the thymus over here there's my
heart

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
heart

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.230 
heart
there's<00:02:05.290> my<00:02:05.590> thymus<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.730> can<00:02:06.850> use<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.120> as<00:02:07.210> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
there's my thymus so you can use it as a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.870 
there's my thymus so you can use it as a
reference<00:02:07.540> point
