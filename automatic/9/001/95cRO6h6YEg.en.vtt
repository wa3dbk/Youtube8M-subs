00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
short novel and yet I really felt that I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.870 
short novel and yet I really felt that I
connected<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.920> characters<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
connected with the characters and I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.970 
connected with the characters and I
really<00:03:12.209> knew<00:03:12.450> them<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.990> I<00:03:13.230> really<00:03:13.470> love<00:03:13.650> them

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
so I'm doing a really bad job at

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.790 
so I'm doing a really bad job at
describing<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.260> i<00:03:16.290> really<00:03:16.620> suggest

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
describing this but i really suggest

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.620 
describing this but i really suggest
that<00:03:17.220> if<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.519> haven't<00:03:17.700> read<00:03:17.880> any<00:03:18.090> neil<00:03:18.239> gaiman

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
that if you haven't read any neil gaiman

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.090 
that if you haven't read any neil gaiman
yet<00:03:18.780> maybe<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.380> would<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> good<00:03:19.890> one<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
yet maybe this would be a good one to

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.650 
yet maybe this would be a good one to
start<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.459> because<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.850> really<00:03:21.239> really<00:03:21.480> loved

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
start with because I really really loved

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.300 
start with because I really really loved

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.949
