easy I just copy this URL put it on my

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.709 
easy I just copy this URL put it on my
other<00:02:25.319> computer<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.069> then<00:02:26.519> it'll<00:02:26.730> open<00:02:26.879> no<00:02:27.510> it

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
other computer and then it'll open no it

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.750 
other computer and then it'll open no it
won't<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.409> won't<00:02:28.639> okay<00:02:31.129> it's<00:02:32.129> it's<00:02:32.519> much

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.309 
won't it won't okay it's it's much
longer<00:02:33.030> process<00:02:33.389> it's<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.019> not<00:02:34.260> that

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
longer process it's actually not that

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.830 
longer process it's actually not that
long<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.219> basically<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.359> need<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.599> replace

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
long so basically you need to replace

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.539 
long so basically you need to replace
the<00:02:37.319> local<00:02:37.920> host<00:02:38.780> entity<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.349> your<00:02:40.739> local<00:02:41.129> IP

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
the local host entity with your local IP

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.970 
the local host entity with your local IP
address<00:02:42.120> which<00:02:42.989> can<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.349> found<00:02:43.530> by<00:02:43.769> clicking

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
address which can be found by clicking

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.940 
address which can be found by clicking
the<00:02:44.790> apple<00:02:45.329> thing<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:46.109> going<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.500> system

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
the apple thing and going to system

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.129 
the apple thing and going to system
preferences<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.879> then<00:02:48.329> going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.719> network

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
preferences and then going to network

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.559 
preferences and then going to network
and<00:02:49.379> look<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.489> there's<00:02:50.819> your<00:02:51.000> local<00:02:51.419> IP

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
and look at that there's your local IP

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.629 
and look at that there's your local IP
address<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.949> copy<00:02:53.189> that<00:02:53.459> bad

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
address so you can just copy that bad

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.659 
address so you can just copy that bad
boy<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.150> paste<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.780> right<00:02:54.959> there<00:02:55.620> now<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.519> know

address where it says localhost so you

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.360 
address where it says localhost so you

would get that and there you go now all
you<00:03:35.549> need<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.849> do<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.329> put<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.290> URL<00:03:37.650> into<00:03:38.340> your

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
you need to do is put that URL into your

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.059 
you need to do is put that URL into your
iPod<00:03:39.329> or<00:03:39.359> any<00:03:39.750> other<00:03:40.169> computer<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.709> your<00:03:40.769> local

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.129 
iPod or any other computer on your local
network<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.699> shebang<00:03:42.299> you're<00:03:42.689> controlling

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
network and shebang you're controlling

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.890 
network and shebang you're controlling
your<00:03:43.319> torrents<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:43.979> that<00:03:44.629> what<00:03:45.629> I<00:03:45.659> would

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
your torrents like that what I would

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.300 
your torrents like that what I would
recommend<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.739> using<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.909> URL<00:03:48.439> shortener<00:03:49.439> to

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
recommend is using a URL shortener to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.729 
recommend is using a URL shortener to
make<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.189> URL<00:03:53.189> not<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.729> ridiculously<00:03:54.540> long<00:03:55.139> so

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
make the URL not so ridiculously long so

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.789 
make the URL not so ridiculously long so
let's<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:57.239> do<00:03:57.419> that<00:03:57.449> so<00:03:57.959> now<00:03:58.139> I've<00:03:58.319> shortened

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
let's just do that so now I've shortened

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.059 
let's just do that so now I've shortened
that<00:03:59.129> giant<00:03:59.969> mama<00:04:00.299> JAMA<00:04:00.719> into<00:04:01.409> something<00:04:01.859> more

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
that giant mama JAMA into something more

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.219 
that giant mama JAMA into something more
manageable<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.969> is<00:04:03.840> GD<00:04:04.590> /<00:04:04.949> 1<00:04:05.340> sx<00:04:05.909> GH<00:04:06.449> easy

manageable like is GD / 1 sx GH easy

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:12.949 
manageable like is GD / 1 sx GH easy
right<00:04:08.150> uh-huh<00:04:09.349> so<00:04:10.349> now<00:04:10.949> move<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.389> over<00:04:12.419> to
