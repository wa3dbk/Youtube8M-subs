I<00:05:19.160> highly<00:05:20.120> doubt<00:05:20.150> we're<00:05:20.360> gonna<00:05:20.420> see<00:05:20.660> iOS<00:05:21.080> 8<00:05:21.290> by

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.230 
I highly doubt we're gonna see iOS 8 by
then<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:22.100> probably<00:05:22.250> it's<00:05:22.490> going<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.670> be<00:05:22.760> iOS

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
then it's probably it's going to be iOS

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.410 
then it's probably it's going to be iOS
7.5<00:05:24.230> or<00:05:24.500> something<00:05:24.800> but<00:05:25.520> those<00:05:26.030> are<00:05:26.210> all<00:05:26.300> the
