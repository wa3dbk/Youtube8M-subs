00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and I was rather excited because I had

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.960 
and I was rather excited because I had
killed<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:22.020> limited<00:00:22.439> quail<00:00:22.850> just<00:00:23.850> the

week prior an old man he looked at me
and<00:00:27.090> he<00:00:27.180> said<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.019> may<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:29.179> you've<00:00:30.179> done

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and he said you may think you've done

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.299 
and he said you may think you've done
something<00:00:30.750> by<00:00:30.960> killing<00:00:31.349> limited<00:00:31.740> quiet

something by killing limited quiet
quail<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.239> about<00:00:33.540> reflexes<00:00:34.670> singles<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
quail was all about reflexes singles and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
different duck hunting is all about

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.700 
different duck hunting is all about

what's the ballistic is no man ballistic

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.279 
what's the ballistic is no man ballistic
is<00:00:47.910> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.920> when<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.840> look<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> way

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is kind of like when you look at the way

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
is kind of like when you look at the way
that<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.800> ducks<00:00:53.070> flying<00:00:53.430> left<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> right

right to left incoming or overhead
outgoing<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:58.980> you've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> factor<00:00:59.879> in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
outgoing and then you've got a factor in
