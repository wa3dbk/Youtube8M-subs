00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so that a very good quarter that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.210 
so that a very good quarter that
actually<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.869> proving<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.890> proves

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
actually is the proving out what proves

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.649 
actually is the proving out what proves
the<00:01:38.640> reason<00:01:38.939> why<00:01:39.119> they're<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.570> looking

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the reason why they're actually looking

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.410 
the reason why they're actually looking
at<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> guess<00:01:40.400> big<00:01:41.400> Peter<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.880> he's<00:01:42.210> cut

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
at you I guess big Peter right he's cut

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
at you I guess big Peter right he's cut
a<00:01:42.450> long<00:01:42.659> kick<00:01:42.930> hasn't<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.130> provides

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
a long kick hasn't it it just provides

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.730 
a long kick hasn't it it just provides
spice<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.869> than<00:01:45.899> anything<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.619> they

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
spice I think more than anything so they

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
spice I think more than anything so they
can<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.040> ask<00:01:47.340> David<00:01:47.790> flood<00:01:48.030> there's<00:01:48.450> no

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
can actually ask David flood there's no

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.179 
can actually ask David flood there's no
