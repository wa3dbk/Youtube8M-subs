00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
need in the canning process but with

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
need in the canning process but with
this<00:01:55.770> rap<00:01:56.099> again<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.789> allows<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.450> jars<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
this rap again it allows the jars to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.800 
this rap again it allows the jars to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
stay separate and not touch so it can

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.050 
stay separate and not touch so it can
actually<00:02:00.989> dry<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> wreck<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.579> place
