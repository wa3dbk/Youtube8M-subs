00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
course one of the reasons why this beast

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.110 
course one of the reasons why this beast
can<00:05:11.050> go<00:05:11.200> as<00:05:11.410> fast<00:05:11.650> as<00:05:11.950> it<00:05:12.100> can<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.520> because<00:05:12.940> of

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
can go as fast as it can is because of

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.740 
can go as fast as it can is because of
the<00:05:13.210> all<00:05:13.390> aluminum<00:05:13.750> body<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.770> light<00:05:15.100> weight

if<00:05:16.750> we<00:05:17.080> talk<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.320> different<00:05:17.860> modes<00:05:18.190> then<00:05:18.550> there

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
if we talk of different modes then there

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.150 
if we talk of different modes then there
is<00:05:18.850> also<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.300> winter<00:05:19.870> mode<00:05:20.080> which<00:05:20.590> increases

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
is also a winter mode which increases

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.830 
is also a winter mode which increases
the<00:05:21.280> traction<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:21.850> prevents<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.540> vehicle

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
the traction and prevents the vehicle

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.920 
the traction and prevents the vehicle
from<00:05:22.990> slipping<00:05:23.440> but<00:05:24.010> my<00:05:24.250> bad<00:05:24.550> luck<00:05:24.790> it<00:05:25.390> doesn't
