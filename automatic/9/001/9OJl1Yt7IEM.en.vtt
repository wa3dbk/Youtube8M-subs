could<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.270> fucking<00:01:48.780> terrible<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
could be fucking terrible and if it is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
could be fucking terrible and if it is
and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.549> probably<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> give<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:52.170> be

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and I probably got to give up to be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
and I probably got to give up to be
honest<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.520> heart<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.939> only<00:01:54.000> take<00:01:54.299> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
honest because my heart can only take so

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.929 
honest because my heart can only take so
much<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> figured<00:01:55.950> we'd<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.250> least<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
much but I figured we'd at least have a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.749 
much but I figured we'd at least have a
look<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.670> we

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
look and see what it was like so here we

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.200 
look and see what it was like so here we
go<00:01:59.909> door<00:02:00.509> number<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> ready
