about the technique of double stirring

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.900 
about the technique of double stirring
which<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.650> idea<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.220> stirring<00:00:23.670> two

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
two hands this is a great technique for

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.750 
two hands this is a great technique for
accelerating<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> process<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.530> building<00:00:35.489> and

stirring drinks so that you can have a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.280 
stirring drinks so that you can have a
little<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.520> time<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.239> focus<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.719> guests

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290

little more time to focus on your guests
and<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:41.700> time<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and a little more time to do all of the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
and a little more time to do all of the
other<00:00:43.079> responsibilities<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.340> have

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
one hand and then after the basics we'll

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
one hand and then after the basics we'll
do<00:00:53.039> two<00:00:53.250> cocktails<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:54.120> time<00:00:54.329> so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.179 
for me to ever move her while she's
sleeping<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.180> I've<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:10.189> mixing

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
sleeping so here we are I've got mixing

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
sleeping so here we are I've got mixing
glasses<00:01:11.580> bar<00:01:12.000> spoons<00:01:12.680> unfortunately<00:01:13.680> they're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
glasses bar spoons unfortunately they're

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
glasses bar spoons unfortunately they're
not<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.430> same<00:01:14.640> spoon<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.360> gonna<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
not the same spoon so it's gonna be a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
not the same spoon so it's gonna be a
little<00:01:15.869> tough<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.890> stir<00:01:17.070> two<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.400> once

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
little tough to stir two at once

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.270 
little tough to stir two at once
actually<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.720> maybe<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.320> realistic<00:01:19.950> since

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
actually it's maybe more realistic since

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.899 
actually it's maybe more realistic since
not<00:01:20.850> everyone<00:01:21.090> works<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.659> bars<00:01:22.350> where<00:01:22.650> there's

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
not everyone works at bars where there's

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.820 
not everyone works at bars where there's
total<00:01:23.909> uniform<00:01:24.450> equipment<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.290> sometimes

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
total uniform equipment right sometimes

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
total uniform equipment right sometimes
you<00:01:25.979> lose<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> spoon<00:01:26.490> sometimes<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.030> bring<00:01:27.210> one

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you lose a spoon sometimes you bring one

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
you lose a spoon sometimes you bring one
from<00:01:27.659> home<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.170> find<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.430> more

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
from home I find that it's it's more

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
from home I find that it's it's more
challenging<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.049> two

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
challenging to do this with two

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
challenging to do this with two
different<00:01:31.409> mixing<00:01:31.890> glasses<00:01:32.570> than<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.750> with

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
different mixing glasses than it is with

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
different mixing glasses than it is with
two<00:01:34.049> different<00:01:34.170> spoons<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.490> still

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
two different spoons but it's still

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
two different spoons but it's still
possible<00:01:35.930> easier<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> proper

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
possible easier to do it in a proper

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.390 
possible easier to do it in a proper
mixing<00:01:38.880> glass<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.390> has<00:01:39.540> straight<00:01:40.049> sides<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
mixing glass that has straight sides in

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
mixing glass that has straight sides in
something<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> pint<00:01:42.540> glass<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.110> something

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
something like a pint glass or something

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.179 
something like a pint glass or something
with<00:01:43.590> graduated<00:01:44.250> edges<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
with graduated edges it's going to be a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
with graduated edges it's going to be a
different<00:01:47.759> circumference<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.689> rotating<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
different circumference for rotating the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
different circumference for rotating the
spoon<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.310> gonna<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> little

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
spoon and that's gonna make it a little

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
spoon and that's gonna make it a little
more<00:01:51.180> challenging<00:01:51.649> especially<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.740> you're

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
more challenging especially if you're

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.960 
more challenging especially if you're
doing<00:01:53.070> two<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.520> once

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
doing two at once

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
doing two at once
so<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> start<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.710> trick<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
so just to start and the trick to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179 
so just to start and the trick to
stirring<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.780> I've<00:01:58.020> got<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.409> between<00:01:58.710> my

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
stirring is that I've got it between my

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.810 
stirring is that I've got it between my
middle<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.000> ring<00:02:00.600> finger<00:02:01.020> okay<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
middle and ring finger okay so this is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.020 
middle and ring finger okay so this is
all<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.689> supporting<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.030> actual

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
all that's really supporting the actual

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.499 
all that's really supporting the actual
stirring<00:02:06.479> motion<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.390> my

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
stirring motion and then you know my

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.990 
stirring motion and then you know my
elbow<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> I've<00:02:11.129> got<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> thumb

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
elbow is kind of up and I've got a thumb

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
elbow is kind of up and I've got a thumb
in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
in the back that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
in the back that
just<00:02:13.770> giving<00:02:14.130> support<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.030> I'm<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.360> using

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
just giving support so I'm just using

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.100 
just giving support so I'm just using
two<00:02:15.930> fingers<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:17.310> between<00:02:17.550> these<00:02:18.540> knuckles

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
two fingers it's between these knuckles

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
two fingers it's between these knuckles
here<00:02:19.500> thumb<00:02:20.310> comes<00:02:20.520> back<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:20.940> support<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
here thumb comes back for support you

here thumb comes back for support you
know<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.500> my<00:02:22.980> other<00:02:23.100> fingers<00:02:23.730> aren't

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
know and and my other fingers aren't

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.060 
know and and my other fingers aren't
really<00:02:24.090> doing<00:02:24.360> much<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:25.350> have<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.800> back

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
really doing much I just have the back

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.430 
really doing much I just have the back
to<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.750> mixing<00:02:27.750> glass<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.320> times<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
to this mixing glass at all times and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.280 
to this mixing glass at all times and
I'm<00:02:31.440> able<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:34.310> stir<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
I'm able to just stir it like so and I

can move it up I can move it down it's
much<00:02:39.480> easier<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.470> ice<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
much easier to do this with ice and

these<00:03:00.150> two<00:03:00.210> fingers<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.290> are<00:03:01.410> doing<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
these two fingers that are doing the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.650 
these two fingers that are doing the
work<00:03:01.770> these<00:03:02.220> two<00:03:02.490> fingers<00:03:02.880> right<00:03:02.910> here<00:03:05.660> for

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
work these two fingers right here for

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.650 
work these two fingers right here for
doing<00:03:06.930> more<00:03:07.440> than<00:03:07.620> one<00:03:08.150> what<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
doing more than one what you have to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.750 
doing more than one what you have to
think<00:03:09.690> about<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.530> if<00:03:10.950> these<00:03:11.220> two<00:03:11.280> fingers

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
think about is that if these two fingers

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.930 
think about is that if these two fingers
can<00:03:12.570> stir<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.140> drink<00:03:13.500> then<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.490> can<00:03:14.670> these<00:03:14.880> two

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
can stir a drink then so can these two

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.460 
can stir a drink then so can these two
or<00:03:15.770> so<00:03:16.770> can<00:03:17.220> these<00:03:17.340> two<00:03:17.580> okay<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:19.230> just

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
or so can these two okay so it's just

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.730 
or so can these two okay so it's just
more<00:03:19.920> comfortable<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.730> easy<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.390> do<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.750> with

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
more comfortable and easy to do it with

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.490 
more comfortable and easy to do it with
just<00:03:22.950> these<00:03:23.070> two<00:03:23.300> fingers<00:03:24.300> but<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.200> could<00:03:25.380> also

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
just these two fingers but I could also

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.850 
just these two fingers but I could also
do<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.800> with<00:03:25.890> these<00:03:26.100> two<00:03:26.280> fingers<00:03:27.830> where<00:03:28.830> I

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
do it with these two fingers where I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.080 
do it with these two fingers where I
could<00:03:29.010> do<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.160> with<00:03:29.280> these<00:03:29.340> two<00:03:29.400> fingers<00:03:29.580> and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
could do it with these two fingers and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.199 
could do it with these two fingers and
that<00:03:30.209> step<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.050> practicing

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
that step one it's just practicing

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.820 
that step one it's just practicing
stirring<00:03:33.209> with<00:03:33.750> any<00:03:35.030> combination<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.780> fingers

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.500 

I'm<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:41.400> kind<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.640> trying<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.060> change

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
I'm just kind of trying to change

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.740 
I'm just kind of trying to change
seamlessly<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:44.370> once<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:45.600> that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
seamlessly and then once you get that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.140 
seamlessly and then once you get that
down<00:03:46.050> then<00:03:46.500> your<00:03:46.709> body<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.370> getting<00:03:47.670> used<00:03:48.000> to

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
down then your body is getting used to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.050 
down then your body is getting used to
the<00:03:48.330> idea<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.810> okay<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.709> really<00:03:50.430> am<00:03:50.610> just<00:03:50.850> using

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the idea of okay I really am just using

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.920 
the idea of okay I really am just using
a<00:03:51.450> thumb<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:52.080> support<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.160> I've<00:03:53.550> got<00:03:53.930> spoon

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
you can see is coming across really

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.380 
you can see is coming across really
straight<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.209> thumbs<00:04:18.480> giving<00:04:18.870> support

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
straight so the thumbs giving support

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.330 
straight so the thumbs giving support
now<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.419> watched<00:04:21.960> my<00:04:22.229> mixing<00:04:22.680> glasses<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.220> be

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
now I watched my mixing glasses to be

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.670 
now I watched my mixing glasses to be
touching<00:04:23.880> or<00:04:24.870> as<00:04:25.080> close<00:04:25.260> together<00:04:25.500> as

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
touching or as close together as

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.210 
touching or as close together as
possible<00:04:25.830> because<00:04:26.460> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
possible because the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.120 
possible because the
it's<00:04:27.370> going<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.790> make<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.870> less<00:04:29.140> extreme<00:04:29.680> angle

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
it's going to make a less extreme angle

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.610 
it's going to make a less extreme angle
for<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.430> two<00:04:30.610> spoons<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.870> now<00:04:32.140> here's<00:04:32.470> my

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
for the two spoons so now here's my

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.470 
for the two spoons so now here's my
spoons<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.700> can<00:04:33.820> see<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.240> there's<00:04:34.420> a

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
spoons and you can see that there's a

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.120 
spoons and you can see that there's a
point<00:04:34.720> where<00:04:34.930> my<00:04:35.110> hand<00:04:35.350> can<00:04:35.590> grip<00:04:35.770> them<00:04:35.950> both

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
point where my hand can grip them both

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.090 
point where my hand can grip them both
I've<00:04:36.820> got<00:04:37.120> two<00:04:37.600> two<00:04:38.050> fingers<00:04:38.350> here<00:04:38.590> two

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
I've got two two fingers here two

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.910 
I've got two two fingers here two
fingers<00:04:39.400> here<00:04:39.430> thumb<00:04:40.300> coming<00:04:40.630> across<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.440> now

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
fingers here thumb coming across and now

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.830 
fingers here thumb coming across and now
it's<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.640> question<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.120> doing<00:04:43.420> them<00:04:43.540> both

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
it's just a question of doing them both

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.610 
it's just a question of doing them both
together<00:04:45.150> all<00:04:46.150> right<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.800> really<00:04:48.520> just

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
together all right so it's really just

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.310 
together all right so it's really just
having<00:04:50.700> two<00:04:51.700> spoons<00:04:52.270> good<00:04:52.660> run<00:04:52.810> at<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.050> same

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
having two spoons good run at the same

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.520 
having two spoons good run at the same
point<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.300> then<00:04:55.300> they<00:04:55.420> meet<00:04:55.690> we're<00:04:56.380> gonna

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
point and then they meet we're gonna

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.990 
point and then they meet we're gonna
meet<00:04:56.680> in<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.860> middle<00:04:56.980> so<00:04:57.280> if<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.490> use<00:04:57.640> really

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
meet in the middle so if I use really

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.780 
meet in the middle so if I use really
long<00:04:58.510> spoons<00:04:58.960> actually<00:04:59.590> I<00:04:59.770> would<00:05:00.430> do<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.640> from

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
long spoons actually I would do it from

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.860 
long spoons actually I would do it from
higher<00:05:01.000> up<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.240> don't<00:05:01.420> really<00:05:01.570> want<00:05:01.780> the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
higher up you don't really want the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.030 
higher up you don't really want the
students<00:05:02.170> to<00:05:02.200> cross<00:05:02.500> because<00:05:02.710> then<00:05:02.920> it's

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
students to cross because then it's

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.860 
students to cross because then it's
gonna<00:05:03.130> be<00:05:03.310> awkward<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:03.910> I've<00:05:04.330> done<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.660> with

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
gonna be awkward so I've done this with

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.200 
gonna be awkward so I've done this with
you<00:05:05.140> know<00:05:05.260> long<00:05:05.770> spoons<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.610> just<00:05:06.760> find<00:05:07.000> a

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
you know long spoons and you just find a

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.550 
you know long spoons and you just find a
point<00:05:07.480> up<00:05:07.660> here<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:09.970> action<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.780> you've

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
point up here to do the action so you've

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.380 
point up here to do the action so you've
built<00:05:11.710> your<00:05:11.860> cocktail<00:05:12.280> you've<00:05:12.880> iced<00:05:13.090> you're

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
built your cocktail you've iced you're

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.260 
built your cocktail you've iced you're
mixing<00:05:14.020> glasses<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:15.250> wanna<00:05:15.430> start<00:05:16.030> with<00:05:16.120> the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
mixing glasses you wanna start with the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.860 
mixing glasses you wanna start with the
spoons<00:05:17.280> already<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.370> your<00:05:18.490> hands<00:05:18.790> if<00:05:19.090> if

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
spoons already in your hands if if

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.130 
spoons already in your hands if if
you're<00:05:20.110> using<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:20.830> cold<00:05:21.370> draft<00:05:21.610> or<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.510> kind<00:05:22.990> of

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
you're using a cold draft or a kind of

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.050 
you're using a cold draft or a kind of
larger<00:05:23.470> ice<00:05:23.620> it's<00:05:23.919> like<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.100> little<00:05:24.310> bit<00:05:24.820> more

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
larger ice it's like a little bit more

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.640 
larger ice it's like a little bit more
challenging<00:05:25.690> sometimes<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.230> can<00:05:26.350> be<00:05:26.380> a<00:05:26.470> little

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
challenging sometimes it can be a little

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.310 
challenging sometimes it can be a little
tricky<00:05:26.950> so<00:05:27.540> sometimes<00:05:28.540> that<00:05:28.690> like<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:28.990> might

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
tricky so sometimes that like so might

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.900 
tricky so sometimes that like so might
we<00:05:29.350> one<00:05:29.560> down<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.130> there<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.340> I'm<00:05:30.700> at<00:05:30.790> the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
we one down in there so I'm at the

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.370 
we one down in there so I'm at the
bottom<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.450> mixing<00:05:31.780> glass<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.230> once

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
bottom of the mixing glass and once

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.720 
bottom of the mixing glass and once
they're<00:05:32.590> in<00:05:32.770> there<00:05:32.980> it<00:05:33.160> maybe<00:05:33.340> give<00:05:33.580> them<00:05:33.640> a

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
they're in there it maybe give them a

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.820 
they're in there it maybe give them a
couple<00:05:34.000> of<00:05:34.090> those<00:05:34.150> stirs<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.650> they're

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
couple of those stirs so that they're

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.640 
couple of those stirs so that they're
loose<00:05:36.430> sometimes<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.720> ice<00:05:37.930> can<00:05:38.200> get<00:05:38.350> sticky

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
loose sometimes the ice can get sticky

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.850 
loose sometimes the ice can get sticky
and<00:05:38.919> freeze<00:05:39.790> to<00:05:39.940> itself<00:05:40.300> so<00:05:40.620> here<00:05:41.620> we<00:05:41.710> go

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
and freeze to itself so here we go

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.460 
and freeze to itself so here we go
they're<00:05:42.280> nice<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:42.460> loose<00:05:42.820> Bryn<00:05:43.540> and<00:05:43.900> then

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
they're nice and loose Bryn and then

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.310 
they're nice and loose Bryn and then
we're<00:05:44.740> just<00:05:44.770> gonna<00:05:44.979> kind<00:05:45.250> of<00:05:45.280> go<00:05:45.430> around<00:05:45.550> and

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
we're just gonna kind of go around and

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.040 
we're just gonna kind of go around and
if<00:05:47.320> if<00:05:47.950> one<00:05:48.370> mixing<00:05:48.790> glass<00:05:48.910> is<00:05:49.330> giving<00:05:49.930> you

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
if if one mixing glass is giving you

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.750 
if if one mixing glass is giving you
trouble<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.950> know<00:05:51.040> you<00:05:51.100> can<00:05:51.370> just<00:05:51.490> kind<00:05:51.729> of

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
trouble you know you can just kind of

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.580 
trouble you know you can just kind of
like<00:05:51.910> give<00:05:52.510> it<00:05:52.540> a<00:05:52.720> couple<00:05:52.870> little<00:05:53.080> pumps<00:05:53.470> to
