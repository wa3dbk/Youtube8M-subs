00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.720
 yes I always think that the 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.010
 most of the benefits of the people come from 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.110
 then actually worse like 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.430
 one and I always think the cool 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.380
 saying that you get compassion 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.550
 given and the envy of itself 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.800
 I always say that should work 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.870
 first my shoes the piece always 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.100
 what I did and then you can 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.030
 I like your prejudices again 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.789
 describe and then I would too 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.860
 Talk to him where else would you like to go? 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.230
 always have less on it much 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.410
 on it and also in the city on the way 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.410
 is 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:56.460
 luckily since 2007 nets soldier 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.539
 So time for 12 years and athletic 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 I was able to write big 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 example my competition diet mean 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.089
 always make cardio directly in the morning and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.899
 we also have at the gym with us 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.090
 in the barracks 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.009
 So that's why the US is soldier 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.140
 actually ideal the profession would be me 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.170
 say bodybuilding with that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.549
 Eat that always fits everything 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.549
 actually just fine 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.570
 my coach I have the huge advantage 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.980
 that my best friend is the one 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.910
 valerie from a sport food store 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.280
 yes, he always has a first one now 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.720
 He bought me competitions completely 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.830
 and the good thing about us is not 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.120
 like such a preparer, I'll tell you 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.980
 in hamburg where lives from hanover 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.420
 actually everything continues I drive 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.700
 do any training with them 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.710
 and he sees me every day recognizing my 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.690
 Body almost better as I know for sure 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.950
 here again gram rice more then tear 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.660
 less a good piece more 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:55.880
 So therefore is my coach course 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:57.710
 very important in the sports game 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.619
 Funnily that always looks totally 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.979
 great ausglich table tennis since 15 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.550
 years 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.190
 I was also two German 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.050
 championship with my team and 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.040
 yes i think weeks just fine enough 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.209
 that you are a bit agile 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.220
 definitely stays playing in football 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.420
 as long as it goes I had to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.920
 but a few problems with the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.790
 kneel because I let the victory for the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.230
 become a sport 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.519
 but now and then at work or 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.840
 play a football tournament again 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.840
 I'm happy to get it 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.409
 basically basically a couple 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.230
 that's cool that I'm back with 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.489
 my coach trained together and you 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.750
 may be at a super support 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.930
 Free exercises like squats 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.400
 bench press and the last two three 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.109
 one actually asks repetition 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.340
 partner out again that's why I am 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.480
 actually always prefer to two and 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.609
 if you have bad day then have 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.590
 he then upholds other good ones again 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.590
 so i train i love 23
