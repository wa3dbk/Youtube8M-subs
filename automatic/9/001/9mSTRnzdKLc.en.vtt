master destiny this is a pretty

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.650 
master destiny this is a pretty
complicated<00:00:14.490> challenge<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.240> requires<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
complicated challenge that requires a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
complicated challenge that requires a
good<00:00:15.929> understanding<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.710> not<00:00:16.890> only<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.430> cards

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
good understanding of not only the cards

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.849 
good understanding of not only the cards
in<00:00:17.789> your<00:00:17.880> hand<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> field<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.650> also

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
in your hand and on the field but also

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.500 
in your hand and on the field but also
the<00:00:20.189> five<00:00:20.430> cards<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> top<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.420> your

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the five cards on the top of your

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.420 
the five cards on the top of your
library<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.350> let's<00:00:22.590> first<00:00:22.830> take<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> look<00:00:23.310> at

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
library so let's first take a look at

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.570 
library so let's first take a look at
the<00:00:23.550> cards<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.029> hand<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.460> right

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the cards in our hand this one right

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.429 
the cards in our hand this one right
here<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.939> big<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.359> index<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.109> lets<00:00:28.289> us

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
here is the big one index it lets us

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.839 
here is the big one index it lets us
look<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> top<00:00:29.130> five<00:00:29.310> cards<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> our

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
look at the top five cards of our

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.130 
look at the top five cards of our
library<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.449> put<00:00:30.480> them<00:00:30.660> back<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.990> any

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
library and then put them back in any

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.380 
library and then put them back in any
order<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.430> explored<00:00:32.880> which<00:00:33.120> lets

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
order then we have explored which lets

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.209 
order then we have explored which lets
us<00:00:33.510> play<00:00:33.780> an<00:00:33.930> additional<00:00:34.320> landis<00:00:34.710> turn<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
us play an additional landis turn and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.060 
us play an additional landis turn and
draw<00:00:35.460> card<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.540> cars<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> 3-2<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.680> hasten

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
draw card this cars a 3-2 with hasten

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.880 
draw card this cars a 3-2 with hasten
cascade<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.809> basically<00:00:39.809> cascade<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.649> allow

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
cascade and basically cascade will allow

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
cascade and basically cascade will allow
us<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> put<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> card<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.149> top<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.540> our

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
us to put a card that is on top of our

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
us to put a card that is on top of our
library<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.559> play<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.980> has<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> converted

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
library into play that has a converted

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
library into play that has a converted
mana<00:00:44.730> cost<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.300> three<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.809> less<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
mana cost of three or less and then the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
mana cost of three or less and then the
other<00:00:47.160> two<00:00:47.340> cards<00:00:47.700> aren't<00:00:47.850> important<00:00:48.300> don't

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
other two cards aren't important don't

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.959 
other two cards aren't important don't
worry<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:52.160> now<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> field<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.789> have

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
worry about them now the field we have

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.250 
worry about them now the field we have
Jenna<00:00:54.270> wishes<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:55.440> lets<00:00:55.739> us<00:00:55.860> tap<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
Jenna wishes which lets us tap for and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.240 
Jenna wishes which lets us tap for and
essentially<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> top<00:00:58.800> car<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.129> our

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
essentially put the top car of our

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
essentially put the top car of our
library<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.969> play<00:01:00.210> without<00:01:00.629> having<00:01:01.079> pay

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
library into play without having pay

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.229 
library into play without having pay
it's<00:01:01.379> called<00:01:01.649> Casa<00:01:02.160> cross<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> other

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it's called Casa cross down the other

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
it's called Casa cross down the other
side<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> field<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:03.989> fast<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
side of the field really fast we have a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.920 
side of the field really fast we have a
card<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.220> must<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.030> sacrificed<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.780> it's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
card that must be sacrificed if it's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.230 
card that must be sacrificed if it's
hard<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> spell<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.740> ability<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.490> card<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
hard with a spell or ability a card that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
hard with a spell or ability a card that
can<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.479> block<00:01:09.780> flying<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.680> regular<00:01:10.799> for

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
can only block flying and a regular for

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.840 
can only block flying and a regular for
for<00:01:11.460> flying<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:13.280> finally<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:14.490> has<00:01:14.670> an

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
for flying and finally he has an

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
for flying and finally he has an
enchantment<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.509> makes<00:01:15.840> him<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.170> hexproof

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
enchantment that makes him have hexproof

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
enchantment that makes him have hexproof
and<00:01:17.009> hexproof<00:01:17.400> essentially<00:01:18.090> means<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and hexproof essentially means that the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
and hexproof essentially means that the
player<00:01:19.890> cannot<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> target<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> spells<00:01:21.180> or

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
player cannot be the target of spells or

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.899 
player cannot be the target of spells or
abilities<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> start<00:01:23.700> off<00:01:23.850> by

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
abilities so I'm going to start off by

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
abilities so I'm going to start off by
casting<00:01:24.450> index<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:25.890> top

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
casting index so we can look at our top

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.870 
casting index so we can look at our top
five<00:01:26.250> cards<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.110> island<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.640> car

will let's put out another land if it's
