00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.339 
be playing that sorry so that's the
reason<00:02:15.640> why<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.819> decided<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.450> actually<00:02:16.989> give

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
reason why I decided to actually give

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.110 
reason why I decided to actually give
other<00:02:17.590> classes<00:02:18.099> at<00:02:18.220> tried<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.640> I'm<00:02:18.790> very

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
other classes at tried it I'm very

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
other classes at tried it I'm very
uncomfortable<00:02:19.299> with<00:02:19.930> one<00:02:20.379> of<00:02:20.500> them<00:02:20.620> being<00:02:20.769> a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
uncomfortable with one of them being a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.259 
uncomfortable with one of them being a
broke<00:02:21.159> I've<00:02:21.340> never<00:02:21.519> really<00:02:21.760> played<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> rock

I've never really played a horde
character<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.129> I<00:02:24.459> figured<00:02:24.819> why<00:02:25.120> not<00:02:25.150> actually

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
character and I figured why not actually

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.600 
character and I figured why not actually
make<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> class<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.830> I'm<00:02:26.950> uncomfortable<00:02:27.069> with

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
make a class that I'm uncomfortable with

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.759 
make a class that I'm uncomfortable with
and<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.540> know<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.690> faction<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:29.440> well<00:02:29.590> that

and a you know a faction as well that

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.649 
and a you know a faction as well that
I've<00:02:29.860> never<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.370> played<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.849> go<00:02:31.239> ahead<00:02:31.480> on

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
I've never really played and go ahead on

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.300

a different server and give this one a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.399 
a different server and give this one a
try<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.790> far<00:02:34.030> I've<00:02:34.239> been<00:02:34.510> really<00:02:34.959> really

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
try and so far I've been really really

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.710

really enjoying it and you know
obviously<00:02:37.870> since<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.620> kind<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.920> low<00:02:39.010> level

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
obviously since I'm kind of low level

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.770 
obviously since I'm kind of low level
right<00:02:39.519> now<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.640> can't<00:02:40.030> really<00:02:40.239> make<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.659> money

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780

just<00:02:52.720> taking<00:02:52.989> my<00:02:53.079> time<00:02:53.109> having<00:02:53.500> fun<00:02:53.769> leveling

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
just taking my time having fun leveling

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.099 
just taking my time having fun leveling
and<00:02:54.310> seeing<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.030> whole<00:02:55.180> different<00:02:55.690> side<00:02:55.870> of

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
and seeing a whole different side of

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.750

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
before so the short answer is the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.180 
before so the short answer is the
hunters<00:03:01.930> are<00:03:02.170> really<00:03:02.470> awesome<00:03:02.650> they're

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
really really fun to play but they're

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.899 
really really fun to play but they're
literally<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.799> exact<00:03:06.190> same<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.579> they<00:03:06.730> were<00:03:06.879> in

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
literally the exact same as they were in

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.059 
literally the exact same as they were in
mists<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.180> pandaria<00:03:07.329> with<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.379> removal<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
specs where you basically just switch

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.039

that switches the game up completely but

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.089 
that switches the game up completely but
for<00:03:34.329> hunters<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:35.049> really<00:03:35.500> isn't<00:03:35.769> that

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
for hunters it really isn't that

one<00:03:37.989> hundred<00:03:38.200> talents<00:03:38.530> are<00:03:38.709> not<00:03:39.220> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
one hundred talents are not that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.089 
one hundred talents are not that
exciting<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.260> removal<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.440> abilities<00:03:41.859> is

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
exciting the removal of the abilities is

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.280 
exciting the removal of the abilities is
all<00:03:42.639> right<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.030> makes<00:03:43.389> for<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.629> better<00:03:43.750> game<00:03:44.049> but

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
all right it makes for a better game but

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.619 
all right it makes for a better game but
it's<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.949> exact<00:03:45.459> same<00:03:45.579> class<00:03:45.849> with<00:03:46.150> less

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629
