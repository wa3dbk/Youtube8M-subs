00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 rigid for February because I want 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.320
 another book that wants to read like that because 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 of the saga songs and on fire and already 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.269
 what comes out of it I will be reading 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.189

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.590
 that the fifth season of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 I joined the faculty and nothing of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 that's why I'm going to try to read it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.140
 the sooner for the king bng I'm going to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 be reading those eyes of capi hawkins 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.120
 or in English is the second sight I'm going to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.680
 leave the door here that is very nice 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.300
 we are going to be reading this book yet 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 I do not know when to do the hangout but it's going to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 be February 28 or something like that on the channel 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 from sophie that I'm going to leave your channel 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 so that they go subscribe and if also 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'll leave the link in the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 description of the tÃ³pix where we are going to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.320
 be discussing this book in February 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.600
 and if it is 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.090
 to read it with us again for the challenge 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.399
 where they live and one word per month 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.289
 or something like that where the creator gave us 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.149
 a few words to then choose 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.850
 some book to read that has that 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.100
 word in the title or some word 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.020
 related to which there will be many 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.659
 times words the words for this 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.090
 month are you know I have three books nothing more 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.189
 that have those words and I'm just going to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.610
 start to show and I will say which one I'm going 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.920
 to read one of the most obvious options is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.790
 eurofighter de starace and more that has 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.780
 the word heir 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.080
 another rule with this book is that I 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.510
 I would love to see it but the problem is 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.950
 I did not read crown of midnight so 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.020
 I should also be doing that for 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.860
 I can read this book which I do not 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 annoying but I do not know if this month I can 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.090
 read crown of midnight and this book subject 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.310
 If I can do it, I'll be doing it 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.100
 but I'm not very sure and then also 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.900
 I have one time line that I've done 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.270
 this is the second book in the saga 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.460
 sunshine and brief and to read this book 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.440
 I should also read in saint and bright 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.880
 I'll try if I can I'll do it 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.440
 but the truth is that I'm not sure 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.960
 because maybe I 'm very busy this 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.470
 month etcetera etcetera and the third 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.290
 option is if there are already two that you have yes that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.090
 marc that is related to water like this 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.920
 that I tell it and this is the first 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.780
 book of a series and I think I'm going to 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.060
 be reading this book first because 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.640
 that prime neuron series and I do not have to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.990
 read any drone from this one 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.030
 so it is most likely that 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.340
 reading this book and then spinals 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.620
 comment on my challenges and resolutions because 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.620
 I started it then it was that I love giunti 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.680
 daily approximately is horrible as 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.870
 huge but good my fun and I'm going to 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.650
 be taking out a piece of paper to read this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.330
 month 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.760
 I'll be taking moments when I'm not 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.760
 I know which one I want to choose and the spending is going 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.319
 to help 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.319
 so I'm going to choose an hour 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.350
 good came out alcaz victoria 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.030
 and arkaitz of victory the swap could 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.130
 be reading this book so I think 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.290
 I'm going to read it because it's short 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.690
 it also has a hole in the cover that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.480
 I do not know if you have the previous challenge 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.319
 but 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.319
 and 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.450
 and those were the first ones that I think 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.370
 I will be reading in the month obviously 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.740
 I am not one of the people who fulfills his 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.780
 activity usually but know that a 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.940
 minus these three books if I'm going to 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.420
 be reading and what in the next 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.420
 video
