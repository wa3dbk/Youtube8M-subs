scissors some kind of glue probably need

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.570

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
will pick up some some little fluffy

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
will pick up some some little fluffy
balls<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:18.380> few<00:01:19.380> googly<00:01:19.770> eyes<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
balls and a few googly eyes now the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.230 
balls and a few googly eyes now the
first<00:01:21.810> step<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.590> you've<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.860> your<00:01:22.950> sock<00:01:23.240> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
first step when you've got your sock is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.539 
first step when you've got your sock is
to<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:27.119> how<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.420> gonna<00:01:27.600> fit

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
to put it on and see how it's gonna fit

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
to put it on and see how it's gonna fit
so<00:01:29.810> generally<00:01:30.810> whether<00:01:31.079> he'll<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.040> there

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so generally whether he'll is just there

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.210 
so generally whether he'll is just there
that's<00:01:32.520> where<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:32.939> thing<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
that's where your thing is going to be

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.890 
that's where your thing is going to be
and<00:01:34.790> then<00:01:35.890> there's<00:01:36.890> your<00:01:37.070> sock<00:01:37.250> puppet<00:01:37.280> sheep

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
and then there's your sock puppet sheep

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.730 
and then there's your sock puppet sheep
so<00:01:38.900> your<00:01:39.020> eyes<00:01:39.110> are<00:01:39.230> probably<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.650> go

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
so your eyes are probably going to go

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.020 
so your eyes are probably going to go
around<00:01:39.980> here<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.580> we're<00:01:40.670> going<00:01:40.760> to<00:01:40.850> want<00:01:40.940> to

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
around here so we're going to want to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.400 
around here so we're going to want to
mark<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.440> if<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:42.800> draw<00:01:43.010> a<00:01:43.040> little<00:01:44.410> black

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
mark so if we just draw a little black

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.610 
mark so if we just draw a little black
mark<00:01:45.680> on<00:01:45.860> there<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.140> that's<00:01:48.290> where<00:01:48.470> your<00:01:48.560> eye

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
mark on there so that's where your eye

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.980 
mark on there so that's where your eye
is<00:01:48.680> going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.980> be<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.760> then<00:01:50.720> you've<00:01:50.810> got<00:01:50.900> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
is going to be and then you've got the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.960 
is going to be and then you've got the
mouth<00:01:51.170> here<00:01:51.470> it's<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.800> probably<00:01:52.640> good<00:01:52.760> idea

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
mouth here it's a probably good idea

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.960 
mouth here it's a probably good idea
just<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:56.170> mark<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.470> little<00:01:57.830> bit<00:01:58.010> it's<00:01:58.910> not

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
just to mark on a little bit it's not

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.550 
just to mark on a little bit it's not
really<00:01:59.210> obvious<00:01:59.300> but<00:01:59.780> you'll<00:02:00.050> be<00:02:00.140> able<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.380> see

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
really obvious but you'll be able to see

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.090 
really obvious but you'll be able to see
it<00:02:00.680> when<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:00.950> are<00:02:02.320> when<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.380> lay<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.860> flock

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it when you are when you lay the flock

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.630 
it when you are when you lay the flock
out<00:02:04.840> then<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.960> flock<00:02:06.170> when<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.800> lay<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.160> sock

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
out then the flock when you lay the sock

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.160 
out then the flock when you lay the sock
out<00:02:07.820> flat<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:09.880> then<00:02:10.880> everything<00:02:11.540> else<00:02:11.630> will

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
out flat and then everything else will

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.460 
out flat and then everything else will
just<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.530> down<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.250> bit<00:02:13.490> here<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:15.350> as

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
just be down this bit here and here as

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.149 
just be down this bit here and here as
well

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.050 

so<00:02:19.670> take<00:02:19.939> a<00:02:19.969> sock<00:02:20.180> off<00:02:20.390> now

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.500 

mmm

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
mmm

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.320 
mmm
now<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.409> decide<00:02:27.950> which<00:02:28.159> color<00:02:28.400> G<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.730> go<00:02:28.849> for<00:02:29.120> I

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
now you decide which color G to go for I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.350 
now you decide which color G to go for I
think<00:02:30.069> yellow<00:02:31.069> look<00:02:31.790> pretty<00:02:32.030> good<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.269> this

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
think yellow look pretty good on this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.149 
think yellow look pretty good on this
one

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
one

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.619 
one
maybe<00:02:34.450> actually<00:02:35.450> we'll<00:02:35.780> go<00:02:35.870> for<00:02:36.049> blue<00:02:37.390> now<00:02:38.390> for

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
maybe actually we'll go for blue now for

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.339 
maybe actually we'll go for blue now for
a<00:02:38.690> tail<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.140> one<00:02:42.409> here<00:02:42.709> it's<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.549> a

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
a tail like this one here it's just a

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.990 
a tail like this one here it's just a
triangle<00:02:45.349> bit<00:02:45.530> there<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.519> some<00:02:46.730> spiky

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
triangle bit there and then some spiky

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.430 
triangle bit there and then some spiky
bits<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> what<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:49.910> will<00:02:49.970> do<00:02:50.230> let's<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.410> a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
bits so what we will do let's get a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
bits so what we will do let's get a
ruler<00:02:53.110> need<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.290> measure<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.829> spiky<00:02:55.280> bit

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
ruler need to measure out the spiky bit

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.470 
ruler need to measure out the spiky bit
so<00:02:57.129> pen<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:01.310> draw<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.549> diagonal<00:03:02.120> line<00:03:02.450> down

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
so pen you draw a diagonal line down

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.680 
so pen you draw a diagonal line down
there<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.110> felt<00:03:03.410> left<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.860> spiky<00:03:04.190> bit<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
there the felt left and spiky bit and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.960 
there the felt left and spiky bit and
then<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.500> need<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.650> tail<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.069> well<00:03:07.099> I'll<00:03:07.730> draw

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
then we need the tail as well I'll draw

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.590 
then we need the tail as well I'll draw
another<00:03:08.319> diagonal<00:03:09.319> line<00:03:09.590> down<00:03:09.620> here

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.850 

so<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:14.780> wasting<00:03:15.140> too<00:03:15.260> much<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:17.420> felt

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
so not wasting too much of the the felt

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.260 
so not wasting too much of the the felt
from<00:03:18.860> now<00:03:19.040> we'll<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:19.730> cut<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.030> out

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:33.330 

you

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340

you

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.420 

I'll<00:03:42.080> do<00:03:42.610> those<00:03:43.610> bikes<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.150> go<00:03:44.270> tail<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:45.430> just

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
I'll do those bikes you go tail and just

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.310 
I'll do those bikes you go tail and just
glue<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:46.940> with<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.330> red-blue<00:03:48.700> sorry<00:03:49.700> I

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
glue on that with the red-blue sorry I

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.200 
glue on that with the red-blue sorry I
know<00:03:51.320> need<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.620> make<00:03:52.000> some<00:03:53.000> arms<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:56.060> we'll

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
know need to make some arms and we'll

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:05.770 
know need to make some arms and we'll
just<00:03:56.360> draw<00:03:56.510> those<00:03:56.690> on<00:03:56.950> here

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780
