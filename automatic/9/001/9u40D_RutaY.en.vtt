00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:11.219
 Hello everyone guys in this video speech 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:14.009
 will go about about the framework when the house is such a pro 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.670
 framework for the functionality of this program 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.789
 I will immediately say need root rights 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.359
 the program is necessary for and where to check 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.990
 market licenses and to emulate purchases 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:34.110
 inside applications 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:40.050
 It means how the program works at the first 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.360
 start even though I said you need root rights 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.730
 and at the first start necessarily needed 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.239
 Internet should be turned on only when 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.879
 the apron generally wants to run itself 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 first start program will be long so 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.510
 how the program will read all 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.649
 applications that you have installed on 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:06.350
 smartphone and select the application 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:10.290
 which we wanted to buy let's say so 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 I will select this purchase emulation 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:22.159
 example aviary application and now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 the program works on this application 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.960
 creates so called shopping emulation 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.540
 We have many paid apps . 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:46.310
 paid photo processing tools 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.220
 image files for example 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:56.570
 Now we select a photo 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:02.190
 there will be some let's say effects 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:06.770
 stickers defects like we take 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:11.180
 an example of the ear drik frame and go to the store 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.160
 shop to make a purchase 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:22.310
 see there are both free and paid 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:29.840
 add-ons select add-on right here 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 moment we look if ray cards we have 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:44.280
 there is a project so it means we can safely 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.180
 this thing is all buy a card or cards 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:54.799
 have no problem push buy 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.040
 and as they say buy buy what 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.019
 have chosen 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.829
 clicked buy and the program starts 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:08.390
 work here see payment do all 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:11.820
 data data frames and which we selected 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.360
 addition dwell on our troubles 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.360
 loading 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.770
 we already see them restored like this 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:36.430
 installed but bought it like this 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.310
 make other purchases principle 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.350
 which 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:49.350
 which program allows it to do 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:53.950
 I have seen here until applets 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.220
 let's say a lot so bought with 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.250
 using free at home but there is one small 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.360
 minus this program as you can see now 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.670
 I mean buzz and blue need 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.260
 my user arises such 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.420
 the problem is people write that disappears 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.690
 Internet on the Internet disappears 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.820
 it does not give access to the Internet 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.980
 to google services that is with us 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.630
 neither the mail they think plus works 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.060
 services that involve funds with 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.290
 google to work all the fault 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.590
 here is the utility 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:38.080
 it was precisely freedom that conveyed the moon 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.080
 what do we do if it happens yes we go 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.350
 Again , the same program 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:49.120
 press the menu key and here we press 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:53.140
 stop program to install everything like this 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.670
 this problem is solved all the guys all 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.670
 Thank you for your attention so far.
