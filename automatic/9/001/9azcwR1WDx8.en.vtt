holy<00:01:59.960> Porsche<00:02:00.560> our<00:02:01.280> cars<00:02:01.840> cartoon<00:02:02.840> car<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.229> the

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
holy Porsche our cars cartoon car so the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.899 
holy Porsche our cars cartoon car so the
wheels<00:02:03.500> are<00:02:03.679> scaled<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.429> proportions

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
wheels are scaled up and the proportions

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.789 
wheels are scaled up and the proportions
are<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.090> little<00:02:05.270> cuter<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:05.780> sweeter<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
are a little cuter and sweeter and the

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.469 
are a little cuter and sweeter and the
one<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.979> main<00:02:07.130> things<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.729> windshield<00:02:08.299> is

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
one the main things is the windshield is

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.699 
one the main things is the windshield is
brought<00:02:08.690> up<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.080> we<00:02:09.170> can<00:02:09.289> read<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> eyes

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
brought up so we can read the eyes

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.130 
brought up so we can read the eyes
better<00:02:09.979> we're<00:02:10.880> building<00:02:11.239> something<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.900> is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
better we're building something that is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.930 
better we're building something that is
an<00:02:12.290> animation<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:13.010> basically<00:02:13.459> starts<00:02:13.819> in

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
an animation that basically starts in

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.070 
an animation that basically starts in
someone's<00:02:14.209> head<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:14.660> changing

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
someone's head that's changing

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.990 
someone's head that's changing
constantly<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.950> it's<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.700> challenge

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
constantly so it's a challenge

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.280 
constantly so it's a challenge
they<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.270> actually<00:02:20.569> make<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.840> work<00:02:21.020> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
they have to actually make it work I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.900 
they have to actually make it work I
mean<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.530> has<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.800> turn<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.340> there's<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.819> be<00:02:22.849> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
mean it has to turn and there's to be a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.220 
mean it has to turn and there's to be a
motor<00:02:23.120> if<00:02:23.390> we're<00:02:23.569> gonna<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.050> might<00:02:24.080> as

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
motor if we're gonna do it we might as

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.360 
motor if we're gonna do it we might as
well<00:02:24.290> do<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.530> right<00:02:24.620> Andy<00:02:24.980> Paul<00:02:25.160> has<00:02:25.280> this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
well do it right Andy Paul has this

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.830 
well do it right Andy Paul has this
ability<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.790> make<00:02:26.000> something<00:02:26.420> out<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.720> nothing
