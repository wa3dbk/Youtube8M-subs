character and then the final so it's

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.140 
character and then the final so it's
it's<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.460> little<00:03:39.520> but<00:03:39.820> respect<00:03:40.590> reflect<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
it's a little but respect reflect the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.460 
it's a little but respect reflect the
traditional<00:03:43.150> form<00:03:43.360> of<00:03:43.420> concerto<00:03:43.990> but<00:03:44.140> not

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
traditional form of concerto but not

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.650 
traditional form of concerto but not
it's<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.310> not<00:03:45.400> not<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:46.000> over<00:03:46.420> so

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
it's you know it's not not to over so

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.050 
it's you know it's not not to over so
that<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.680> think<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:48.340> why<00:03:48.490> this<00:03:48.550> reason

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
that I think that that's why this reason

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.530 
that I think that that's why this reason
to<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:50.010> constitutive<00:03:51.010> relations<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:52.450> I

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
to the constitutive relations but I

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.860 
to the constitutive relations but I
didn't<00:03:52.930> come<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.470> eleven<00:03:53.710> this<00:03:53.950> case<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.490> I

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
didn't come on eleven this case it I

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
didn't come on eleven this case it I
think<00:03:55.870> it's<00:03:55.990> difficult<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.620> tell<00:03:57.190> them<00:03:57.400> apart

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
think it's difficult to tell them apart

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.700 
think it's difficult to tell them apart
no<00:03:58.450> it's<00:03:58.630> it's<00:03:58.840> possible<00:03:59.050> it's<00:03:59.650> possible

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
no it's it's possible it's possible

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.680 
no it's it's possible it's possible
because<00:04:00.040> it's<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.730> structurally<00:04:01.360> it's<00:04:01.480> very

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
because it's it's structurally it's very

00:04:01.690 --> 00:05:52.790 
because it's it's structurally it's very
very<00:04:01.930> clear

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.860 

you
