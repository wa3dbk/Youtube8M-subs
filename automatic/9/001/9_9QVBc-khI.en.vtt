00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.012
 Three MPs 

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:28.024
 Of the greatest 

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:31.024
 They woke up at dawn 

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:34.039
 On singers 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.039
 The eyes were washed 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.046
 And they were combed 

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.033
 They got ready 

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.053
 Traveling 

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:49.047
 The road will be tough 

00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:52.041
 Pan to God 

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.051
 Where they were called 

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.047
 Ask yourself 

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:23.000
 Who, how and when 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.018
 She saw her crying. 

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:29.002
 Who's upset them 

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.071
 And he cried out 

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.080
 Who asked him 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.062
 How they got fat 

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.077
 In a year 

00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:43.097
 With so many kiles. 

00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:46.090
 The parliamentarians 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.089
 Of the greatest 

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:52.082
 Many have whirled 

00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:56.028
 They conspired 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.039
 When will it be? 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.023
 Lord to call him 

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:40.036
 Who asked him 

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:43.017
 Who saddled them 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.020
 That they got fat 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.033
 With so many kiles 

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:53.034
 They just answer 

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:56.003
 Do not comment 

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:58.090
 To answer the choir 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.078
 That's easier 

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:25.057
 You have a choice. 

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:28.052
 We argue too often 

00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:31.044
 It's not a week 

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.037
 Do not shake hands 

00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:37.037
 A threat 

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:40.012
 God likes beasts 

00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.014
 And the myrrh 

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:46.007
 We were looking at them 

00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:49.002
 Tears pound us 

00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:52.001
 And we eat with fear 

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.077
 Like in an old poem 

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:57.091
 We cry and eat 

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.081
 And without wanting to 

00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:04.025
 God, we did not get fat.
