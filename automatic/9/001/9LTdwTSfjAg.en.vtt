00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.100 
empowered to me it's like that I really
like<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> bitterness<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.870> it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
like the bitterness and I like it's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.680 
like the bitterness and I like it's
quite<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:06.580> very<00:03:06.730> complex<00:03:07.240> there's<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.540> lot

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
quite a it's very complex there's a lot

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.380 
quite a it's very complex there's a lot
going<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:10.090> got<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> real<00:03:10.810> kind<00:03:11.320> of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
going on it's it's got a real kind of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.140 
going on it's it's got a real kind of
almost<00:03:13.390> heavy<00:03:14.110> heavy<00:03:14.830> IPA<00:03:15.250> but<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:15.940> not

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
almost heavy heavy IPA but it's not

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.790 
almost heavy heavy IPA but it's not
because<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:16.570> only<00:03:16.810> six<00:03:17.050> point<00:03:17.260> five<00:03:17.410> percent

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
because it's only six point five percent

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.340 
because it's only six point five percent
so<00:03:18.130> that's<00:03:18.790> really<00:03:19.240> well-balanced<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.200> get

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
so that's really well-balanced to get

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.920 
so that's really well-balanced to get
that<00:03:20.470> kind<00:03:20.770> of<00:03:20.830> flavor<00:03:21.160> over<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.600> such<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
that kind of flavor over in in such a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.230 
that kind of flavor over in in such a
but<00:03:23.470> it's<00:03:23.620> not<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.430> high-end<00:03:24.820> IPAs

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
but it's not one of the high-end IPAs

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.440 
but it's not one of the high-end IPAs
not<00:03:26.050> high-end<00:03:26.260> high<00:03:27.040> body<00:03:27.340> alcohol<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.420> know

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
not high-end high body alcohol you know

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.550 
not high-end high body alcohol you know
no<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.050> mean

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.140 

it's<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.250> weird<00:03:33.550> noise<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.180> really<00:03:34.450> enjoy<00:03:34.690> it

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.380
