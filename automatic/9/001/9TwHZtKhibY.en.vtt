to<00:02:37.319> figure<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.920> out<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.489> guess<00:02:38.549> but<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.120> does

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
to figure it out I guess but it does

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.479 
to figure it out I guess but it does
take<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.720> little<00:02:40.260> getting<00:02:40.739> used<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.130> you

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
take a little getting used to but you

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.280 
take a little getting used to but you
know<00:02:41.610> I'm<00:02:41.760> sure<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.360> homos<00:02:42.690> will<00:02:42.870> figure<00:02:43.049> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
know I'm sure you homos will figure it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
know I'm sure you homos will figure it
out<00:02:43.440> now<00:02:43.980> there<00:02:44.220> are<00:02:44.400> several<00:02:44.790> options<00:02:45.209> as<00:02:45.750> you

configuration file which we will find

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.870 
configuration file which we will find
out<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> future<00:03:36.359> together<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:38.340> yeah<00:03:38.459> so

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880

out in the future together but yeah so
that's<00:03:39.060> that's<00:03:39.450> pretty<00:03:39.660> cooling<00:03:40.109> on<00:03:40.200> much

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
that's that's pretty cooling on much

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.050 
that's that's pretty cooling on much
more<00:03:40.560> stuff<00:03:40.739> coming<00:03:40.799> also<00:03:41.549> some<00:03:41.880> other

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
work-in-progress stuff is that I think

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.120 
work-in-progress stuff is that I think
this<00:03:44.430> guy<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.730> eventually<00:03:45.239> planning<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.200> add<00:03:46.500> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130

you know creepers whatever so don't be
too<00:03:54.900> scared<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.709> see<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> zombie<00:03:56.730> looking

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
too scared if you see a zombie looking

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.629 
too scared if you see a zombie looking
like<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.660> but<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.560> try<00:03:58.799> your<00:03:58.919> best<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.340> not

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
like this but just try your best to not

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.659 
like this but just try your best to not
think<00:04:00.000> about<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.389> ghasts<00:04:00.950> yeah<00:04:01.950> just<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.489> yeah

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
think about the ghasts yeah just so yeah

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.460 
think about the ghasts yeah just so yeah
that's<00:04:02.940> pretty<00:04:03.090> much<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.660> whole<00:04:03.750> mod<00:04:04.049> as<00:04:04.349> I'm

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that's pretty much the whole mod as I'm

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.110 
that's pretty much the whole mod as I'm
sure<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.769> figured<00:04:04.950> out<00:04:05.190> by<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.940> is

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
sure you figured out by now this is

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.539 
sure you figured out by now this is
mostly<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.540> aesthetics<00:04:07.319> but<00:04:08.040> there's<00:04:08.190> much

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
mostly just aesthetics but there's much

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.490 
mostly just aesthetics but there's much
more<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.540> do<00:04:09.989> then<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.260> would

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
more that you can do then you would

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.830 
more that you can do then you would
think<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:11.070> example<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.150> install<00:04:12.509> this<00:04:12.660> on

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
think for example if you install this on

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840 
think for example if you install this on
your<00:04:12.930> server<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:13.769> would<00:04:14.009> literally<00:04:14.370> instantly

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
your server it would literally instantly

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.009 
your server it would literally instantly
become<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.540> best<00:04:15.720> server

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
become the best server

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.749 
become the best server
out<00:04:16.139> there<00:04:16.560> doesn't<00:04:17.009> matter<00:04:17.129> if<00:04:17.340> it's<00:04:17.400> full<00:04:17.639> of

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
out there doesn't matter if it's full of

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.150 
out there doesn't matter if it's full of
griefers<00:04:18.150> because<00:04:18.449> when<00:04:18.599> you<00:04:18.660> have<00:04:18.750> this

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
griefers because when you have this

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.080 
griefers because when you have this
nothing<00:04:20.160> else<00:04:20.340> matters

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
nothing else matters

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.450 
nothing else matters
obvious<00:04:21.780> other<00:04:22.229> stuff<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.740> can<00:04:22.889> do<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.250> also

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
obvious other stuff you can do is also

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.159 
obvious other stuff you can do is also
get<00:04:23.729> your<00:04:23.910> friends<00:04:24.180> onto<00:04:24.449> your<00:04:24.599> server<00:04:24.840> and

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
get your friends onto your server and

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.409 
get your friends onto your server and
then<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:25.770> oh<00:04:26.099> dude<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.610> don't<00:04:26.699> feel<00:04:27.180> well

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
then be like oh dude I don't feel well

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.999 
then be like oh dude I don't feel well
and<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.080> log<00:04:28.259> out<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.500> mess<00:04:28.800> with<00:04:28.919> the

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
and then you log out you mess with the

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.129 
and then you log out you mess with the
configuration<00:04:29.310> options<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:30.509> log<00:04:30.690> back<00:04:30.930> in

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
configuration options you log back in

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.800 
configuration options you log back in
and<00:04:31.319> you<00:04:31.379> go<00:04:31.560> oh<00:04:31.830> dude<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.669> think<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.509> just<00:04:33.539> went
