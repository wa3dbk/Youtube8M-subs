00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
paper so you're ripping the paper in a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:07.240 
paper so you're ripping the paper in a
spiral<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.980> nearly<00:00:59.250> done

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250

taking some ordinary water you want to
spray<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.960> water<00:01:18.170> will<00:01:18.470> will<00:01:18.920> dump<00:01:19.130> in

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
spray it and the water will will dump in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.580 
spray it and the water will will dump in
the<00:01:19.340> paper<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:19.940> start<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.450> break<00:01:20.690> up<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
the paper and start to break up the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.859 
the paper and start to break up the
fiber<00:01:21.890> just<00:01:22.400> give<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.000> little<00:01:23.120> scrunch<00:01:23.600> here

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
fiber just give it a little scrunch here

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.920 
fiber just give it a little scrunch here
too<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.170> help<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.590> on<00:01:24.710> its<00:01:24.860> way<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.600> take<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
too to help it on its way so take the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
too to help it on its way so take the
longer<00:01:27.350> end<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:28.869> start<00:01:29.869> twisting<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.800> paper

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
longer end and start twisting the paper

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.770 
longer end and start twisting the paper
make<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.160> end<00:01:34.280> into<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.150> little<00:01:35.450> seed

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
make the end into like a little seed

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.940 
make the end into like a little seed
shape<00:01:36.710> like<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.320> continue<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.710> twist

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
shape like that and continue to twist

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.980 
shape like that and continue to twist
twist<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> paper<00:01:40.820> as<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.890> go<00:01:43.580> round<00:01:43.790> in<00:01:44.180> a

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
twist the paper as you go round in a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.170 
twist the paper as you go round in a
spiral<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.520> I'll<00:01:52.640> speed<00:01:52.910> up<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
spiral like this so I'll speed up the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.420 
spiral like this so I'll speed up the
video<00:01:53.300> here<00:01:53.930> because<00:01:54.649> this<00:01:54.860> will<00:01:55.009> take<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.280> few

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
video here because this will take a few

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.270 
video here because this will take a few
minutes<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:57.200> want<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.500> keep<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.979> going

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
minutes to do you want to keep on going

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.570 
minutes to do you want to keep on going
round<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.850> mind<00:01:59.860> twisting<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> paper<00:02:01.160> as<00:02:01.399> you

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
round and mind twisting the paper as you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.120 
round and mind twisting the paper as you
go<00:02:02.050> making<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.170> spiral<00:02:03.560> bigger<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:03.950> bigger

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
go making the spiral bigger and bigger

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.910 
go making the spiral bigger and bigger
and<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.570> hold<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.020> rows<00:02:06.200> between<00:02:06.500> your

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
and if you hold the rows between your

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.940 
and if you hold the rows between your
finger<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.700> your<00:02:07.850> thumb<00:02:08.500> you'll<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.739> good

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
finger and your thumb you'll get a good

finger and your thumb you'll get a good
grip<00:02:10.160> on<00:02:10.369> all<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.700> papers<00:02:11.090> with<00:02:11.239> doesn't<00:02:11.570> fall

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
grip on all the papers with doesn't fall

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.430 
grip on all the papers with doesn't fall
apart<00:02:15.970> near<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> end<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.989> can<00:02:18.170> see

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
apart near the end here you can see

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.020 
apart near the end here you can see
after<00:02:18.650> at<00:02:18.950> all<00:02:19.100> I'm<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.340> pulling<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.880> that

after at all I'm just pulling in that
last<00:02:20.269> piece<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.760> because<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.690> end<00:02:23.840> is

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
last piece and because the the end is

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.390 
last piece and because the the end is
the<00:02:24.110> center<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.530> paper<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.950> should<00:02:24.980> have

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the center of the paper you should have

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
almost a square piece which we will use

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.830 
almost a square piece which we will use
to<00:02:29.750> actually<00:02:30.220> glue<00:02:31.220> down<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:32.150> rows<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.750> I'm
