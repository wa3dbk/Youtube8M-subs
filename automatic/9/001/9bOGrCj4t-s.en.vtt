to remove without disturbing direct the
master<00:00:56.600> rack<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.019> only<00:00:57.260> rack<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.890> allows

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
master rack is the only rack that allows

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.680 
master rack is the only rack that allows
you<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.399> roll<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.909> balls<00:00:59.120> while<00:00:59.420> there<00:00:59.659> are

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
you to roll the balls while there are

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.200 
you to roll the balls while there are
being<00:00:59.960> compressed<00:01:00.409> from<00:01:00.710> all<00:01:00.890> three<00:01:01.100> sides

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
being compressed from all three sides

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.700 
being compressed from all three sides
this<00:01:02.210> lets<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.600> ball<00:01:02.839> settle<00:01:03.350> into<00:01:03.589> their

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
this lets the ball settle into their

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.310 
this lets the ball settle into their
most<00:01:03.949> compact<00:01:04.430> configuration<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:06.079> is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
most compact configuration and this is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.260 
most compact configuration and this is
why<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.530> master<00:01:07.130> rack<00:01:07.340> outperforms

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
why the master rack outperforms

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.319 
why the master rack outperforms
everything<00:01:09.110> else<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.820> have<00:01:11.000> your<00:01:11.210> own

everything else and if you have your own
table<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.259> will<00:01:12.409> love<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.740> fact<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.250> the
