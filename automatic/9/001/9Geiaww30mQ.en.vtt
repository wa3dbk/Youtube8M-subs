00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.269
 hi everyone so today we 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.200
 finds himself for a new little vlok 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.490
 it had been a while since we had 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.380
 not done so in fact in this little lob 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.599
 I will tell you about a lot of stuff 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.650
 more or less important try bar 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.759
 describe to you all the news of the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.560
 youtube channel tell you what's going on 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.000
 tell you what will happen and so 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.829
 firstly I think the old 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.849
 tools jams the headline of change 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.770
 it's actually that you're going to have a very 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.329
 big change for me just 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.439
 in fact I'm going to move end I'm going 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.610
 actually move in France I'm going 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.820
 to go up in the north of France in the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.530
 North 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.149
 it's a big word I know there is 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.040
 some who will go elsewhere than 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.600
 it's more the north center so at the level 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.039
 of the department in fact I'm going to be in 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.140
 the eure-et-loir so for a duration of at 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.070
 minimum 5 months have a lot more and 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.609
 after I do not know how it's going 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.219
 move on later 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.239
 so it will be a minimum of five months so 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.609
 for those who would not know 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.679
 Basically it's between Paris and the 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.909
 brittany a little bigger fat at the level of 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.289
 big screws so there are charters in 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.309
 big cities there there are still 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.539
 I looked at the fishing 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.760
 still a lot of cool corners already 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.140
 I have already started to spot 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.670
 there is their especially who apparently passes 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.229
 there is a nice street route to chartres 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.220
 that's it I should 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.180
 get along so here's at the level of 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 videos that will change you 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.750
 so here I go fishing there for 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.740
 a good moment float tube I do not think so 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.640
 that I would do it there I think that 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.409
 I can take him in the car 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.549
 because already my car I do not know 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.540
 not even how am I going to do for any 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.369
 put in the time in the car 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.110
 so the float tube unfortunately I 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.860
 think he'll stay here so I think 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.479
 that I am still doing you a lot 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.920
 fishing on foot it will change me that goes 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.969
 to be correspond anyway a lot of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.049
 people what about kana like a lot 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.780
 more who is fishing on foot when float tube 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.189
 of both him on his side will stay from 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.590
 side of narbonne he will stay well where 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.579
 we are where we are now so the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.719
 camera in the lead a little change at 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.159
 level of fishing that there actually he's going 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.479
 to buy in a very short time from here 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.340
 I think a little month a kayak kayak 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.340
 very beautiful km2 and one of the brand 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.299
 rtm phishing for those who know 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.770
 so it's been a while since it trots 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.159
 is there so he's about to 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.680
 crack 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.579
 it will crack and run away when it's mr 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.570
 you know it I think to be it's 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.740
 something that fascinates him more 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.700
 plus me a little less it's true 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.619
 that a little more harm but you said 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.479
 really he really starts hanging on 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.950
 more and more about sea fishing so 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.990
 it will do I think beautiful videos 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.070
 in kayaking there will be way that gorging themselves and 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.060
 in addition he knows a lot of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 world we debate everything and everything so I 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.939
 think he should do well 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.810
 then will continue to go street 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.520
 on narbonne on perpignan 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.509
 surely this is at the level of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.830
 videos it's going to do you like I think 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.819
 a lot of trout diversity too 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.930
 will continue to do I think it's their 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.760
 calm to make some small stay 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.500
 some small stay in ariege 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.250
 so here's the video level I think 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.239
 to do a lot of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.739
 changes it's going to bring some of the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.140
 diversity that I think it's one of 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.250
 one of our strengths we will say here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.630
 diversity we really try to 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.800
 vary as much as possible in terms of 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.970
 videos down for not too much there you this is 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.830
 what I can understand that can be 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.030
 a bit boring then as long as I 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.920
 think so since I'm going to be in the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.989
 north actually I'm not going to be very far 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.150
 a miniac so my dear my dear 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.430
 little amine which would be about a 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.569
 an hour and a half from home pretty much 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.069
 I think that 1h30 2h we had watched 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.940
 so not too far so I think 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.769
 we will follow them sessions with 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.120
 him finally it's not I think saw sir 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.049
 it's really worth it i think of you 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.280
 make beautiful videos what we 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.580
 get along pretty well with amine same 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.410
 well we laugh well especially we can 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.030
 even get bar competitions at 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.190
 mine even when you eat one time 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.049
 catch up but I'll try it go 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.489
 to be hard so here is not bad 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.780
 of changes I think we have it 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.069
 will do that will make me really 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.900
 weird going from the south upwards 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.890
 just at the climate level I will not say 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.870
 nothing for those who live in the north 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.890
 but you will understand me so here is 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.630
 clearly it was really the most 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.190
 big announcement let's say I'm going 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.290
 make you deserve running when that 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.549
 is going to be really going on between the 20th 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.720
 and August 30 roughly I do not know 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.900
 precisely when I speak 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.579
 but this is strength and in a little month 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.570
 then so I think 20 for those 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.980
 who follow me on facebook you have it 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.049
 you saw it on facebook 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.040
 besides for those who do not know it 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.299
 not in a facebook so I you 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.720
 will put the link in the description under 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.299
 the video 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.859
 so we are more than 8000 subscribers like 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.920
 of babolat hab it goes up to a speed of 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.600
 fif or ccc as usual not 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.950
 too much what else do you say I'm going 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.359
 updated to tell you how much 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.680
 try again to ride a gear at 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.079
 bassens and swim over internet which 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.109
 so we and I saw I believe 8045 before 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.650
 that the internet plant so bah voila it's 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.120
 huge 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.410
 these scholars of his climbs of 6000 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.910
 halimi do not even have me I think 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.230
 about a month and a half ago - 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.880
 admires 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.250
 thank you honestly I do not know too much 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.420
 are you also saying it to tell you 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.750
 in its place but that's really a big 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.240
 thank you 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.320
 it's just awesome and so exactly 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.760
 as you doubt we will make a 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.530
 little contest that should happen 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.510
 within one to two weeks 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.100
 so there I contacted a little every 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.120
 partners to have the lots so I 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.150
 think there should be pretty much 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.190
 five or six wolves paula between guys is 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.660
 nice and then well here we are left 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.560
 for the dhimmi of subscribers it happens I 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.160
 think by the end of the summer 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.560
 maybe a little after a year 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.380
 a year and a few almost ten thousand 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.270
 subscribers it's just 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.530
 So here we go thank you so we go 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.580
 the level of fishing right now I 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.660
 do not think that those who live in the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.340
 net same time as all the rest of the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.300
 France apparently maybe the north 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.860
 north which is a little spared 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.750
 I think you see it's still 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.040
 very difficult even we never have 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.430
 as much gallery frankly since we 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.990
 peach 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.190
 I think we never had so much trouble 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.160
 yet fish really is a 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.170
 beauf thing he does 35 pretty much 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.570
 average for two or three weeks or 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.860
 a little more the waters are overheated 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.990
 everywhere in some lakes we have waters 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.070
 at 27.28 in lakes the lake of kara 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.020
 way next to perpignan 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.500
 the water was at 27 in the morning at 10h times 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.090
 halak of 200 hectares so here at 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.090
 fish level the perch it stays 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.080
 attractive medium hair at sea 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.980
 to be calm makes like beautiful 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.940
 digging sessions that has the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.960
 better than before I think that's what 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.460
 can save us for videos 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.840
 because here I am you 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.280
 the moment insurance for videos is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.840
 really not obvious of the black-bass one in 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.979
 not many among us but that's fine 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.150
 I do not worry we will arrive 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.139
 always to make fish go out 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.479
 always to get to make you 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.630
 videos so there at this friday level 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.980
 there I think I would put you 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.120
 a street session in perpignan a beautiful 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.610
 session with carp and everything 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.560
 very funny who listened to me on it 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.690
 think about having told you everything and 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.710
 so go as usual if you have 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.030
 questions via the comments area
