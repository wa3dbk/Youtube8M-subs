for<00:00:00.299> academic<00:00:00.690> textbooks<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.370> have<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.520> make<00:00:02.610> a

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
for academic textbooks I have to make a

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.760 
for academic textbooks I have to make a
slight<00:00:02.760> confession<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.330> don't<00:00:03.870> own<00:00:04.110> any<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
slight confession I don't own any of the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.260 
slight confession I don't own any of the
books<00:00:04.980> which<00:00:05.279> I'm<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.640> talk<00:00:05.790> about<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
books which I'm going to talk about the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.490 
books which I'm going to talk about the
reason<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.930> my<00:00:07.170> college

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
reason for this is that my college

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.830 
reason for this is that my college
library<00:00:07.799> Oxford<00:00:08.160> has<00:00:08.370> all<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.030> books<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.570> fact

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
library Oxford has all the books in fact

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.780 
library Oxford has all the books in fact
they<00:00:10.200> had<00:00:10.380> several<00:00:10.920> copies<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.400> all<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.670> these

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
they had several copies of all of these

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.180 
they had several copies of all of these
books<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> never<00:00:12.719> had<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.049> buy<00:00:13.290> them<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.950> if

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
books so I never had to buy them so if

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.230 
books so I never had to buy them so if
you're<00:00:14.309> interested<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.759> doing<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.969> physics

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
you're interested in doing a physics

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.609 
you're interested in doing a physics
degree<00:00:15.269> which<00:00:15.660> has<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.990> kind<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.230> advantage

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
degree which has that kind of advantage

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.560 
degree which has that kind of advantage
then<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.949> know<00:00:17.070> go<00:00:17.550> check<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.210> physics<00:00:18.510> at

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
then you know go check out in physics at

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.050 
then you know go check out in physics at

pretty much all the maps you'll need to
know<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.190> an<00:00:38.340> undergraduate<00:00:38.700> physics<00:00:38.940> degree

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
know in an undergraduate physics degree

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
know in an undergraduate physics degree
it's<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> one-stop<00:00:40.260> shop<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it's like a one-stop shop if you have a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.190 
it's like a one-stop shop if you have a
particular<00:00:41.510> problem<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.870> coming<00:00:43.020> up

particular problem which are coming up
with<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.010> need<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> remind

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
with that you just need to remind

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.310 
with that you just need to remind
yourself<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.660> something<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.170> need<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
yourself of something or you need to

go to it's the one maths book which I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.990 
go to it's the one maths book which I
would<00:00:49.920> recommend<00:00:50.039> everybody<00:00:50.700> who's<00:00:50.820> doing<00:00:50.969> a

now<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:16.170> lucky<00:01:16.350> enough<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.650> lectured<00:01:17.070> by

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
now I was lucky enough to be lectured by

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
now I was lucky enough to be lectured by
one<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> blonde<00:01:17.759> ELLs<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.380> he<00:01:19.380> was

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
one of the blonde ELLs and he was

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.050 
one of the blonde ELLs and he was
probably<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.100> best<00:01:20.189> lecturer<00:01:20.580> I've<00:01:20.670> ever<00:01:20.850> had

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
probably the best lecturer I've ever had

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.840 
probably the best lecturer I've ever had
and<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.570> textbook<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:23.070> basically<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.700> being

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and the textbook is basically like being

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
and the textbook is basically like being
lectured<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.240> him<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.900> print<00:01:25.530> form<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

incredibly<00:01:27.119> accessible<00:01:27.360> he<00:01:28.110> makes<00:01:28.350> the

heard about outside of Oxford but I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.480 
heard about outside of Oxford but I
really<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> deserves<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.920> become<00:01:56.250> like

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the end of the chapters and I find very

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.749 
the end of the chapters and I find very
compellingly<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.540> has<00:02:03.780> biographies<00:02:04.560> of

compellingly it also has biographies of

compellingly it also has biographies of
particularly<00:02:05.759> important<00:02:06.090> scientists<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.540> the

end<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.810> every<00:02:06.960> chapter<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
end of every chapter so you have like a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.430 
end of every chapter so you have like a
one-page<00:02:09.179> bog<00:02:09.360> rafi<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.050> Maxwell

pretty<00:04:25.389> much<00:04:25.539> just<00:04:25.900> mats<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.949> if<00:04:27.849> you<00:04:28.150> think

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
pretty much just mats and if you think

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.490 
pretty much just mats and if you think
about<00:04:28.630> quantum<00:04:29.050> mechanics<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.440> a

about quantum mechanics in a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.050 
about quantum mechanics in a
mathematical<00:04:29.979> way<00:04:30.009> which<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.460> ultimately<00:04:30.789> how

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
mathematical way which is ultimately how

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.800 
mathematical way which is ultimately how
the<00:04:31.120> theory<00:04:31.389> developed<00:04:32.789> it's<00:04:33.810> supremely

the theory developed it's supremely

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.439 
the theory developed it's supremely
useful<00:04:35.259> it's<00:04:35.860> like<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> tour<00:04:36.250> de<00:04:36.370> force<00:04:36.449> and

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
useful it's like a tour de force and

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.790 
useful it's like a tour de force and
even<00:04:38.020> though<00:04:38.110> I'm<00:04:38.169> not<00:04:38.229> mathematically
