you guys what that looks like so here's
our<00:00:40.469> closet<00:00:40.890> I'll<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.280> step<00:00:41.430> back<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
our closet I'll just step back so you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.970 
our closet I'll just step back so you
can<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.390> um<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.260> used<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> door

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
can see it's um it used to have a door

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
can see it's um it used to have a door
on<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.640> took<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> door<00:00:45.210> off

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
on it but we just took the door off

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
on it but we just took the door off
because<00:00:45.629> when<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.930> open<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.559> would<00:00:46.710> block

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
because when you open it it would block

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
because when you open it it would block
a<00:00:47.850> lot<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> storage<00:00:48.539> back<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.750> so

if<00:01:50.780> at<00:01:51.229> all<00:01:51.260> possible<00:01:51.409> hang<00:01:52.159> up<00:01:52.310> all<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.880> your

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
if at all possible hang up all of your

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.540 
if at all possible hang up all of your
clothes<00:01:53.390> it's<00:01:53.990> not<00:01:54.229> always<00:01:54.440> easy<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> do<00:01:55.130> but

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
clothes it's not always easy to do but

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.490 
clothes it's not always easy to do but
if<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.760> can<00:01:55.910> have<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.270> space<00:01:56.540> try<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.260> keep

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
if you can have the space try to keep

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.200 
if you can have the space try to keep
everything<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:58.010> your<00:01:58.160> sight<00:01:58.369> line<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.880> just

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
everything in your sight line it just

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.550 
everything in your sight line it just
makes<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.720> much<00:01:59.780> easier<00:01:59.930> when<00:02:00.409> you're

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
makes it so much easier when you're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.350 
makes it so much easier when you're
actually<00:02:00.770> going<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.190> get<00:02:01.310> dressed<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.970> then

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
actually going to get dressed and then

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.940 
actually going to get dressed and then
putting<00:02:02.630> away<00:02:02.780> laundry<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.350> breeze<00:02:03.650> too

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
putting away laundry is a breeze too

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.770 
putting away laundry is a breeze too
finally<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.060> clothes<00:02:05.270> don't<00:02:05.509> get<00:02:05.660> as

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
finally the clothes don't get as

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.900 
finally the clothes don't get as
wrinkled<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.530> find<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.250> you're<00:02:07.400> able

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
wrinkled so I find that if you're able

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.580 
wrinkled so I find that if you're able
to<00:02:07.940> hang<00:02:08.330> your<00:02:08.479> stuff<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:09.470> good

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
to hang your stuff up it's a really good

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.560 
to hang your stuff up it's a really good
idea<00:02:09.740> my<00:02:10.520> second<00:02:10.850> tip<00:02:10.940> goes<00:02:11.150> along<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:11.510> that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
idea my second tip goes along with that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.050 
idea my second tip goes along with that
and<00:02:11.690> that's<00:02:11.959> less<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.560> more<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.520> if<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.880> don't

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and that's less is more so if you don't

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.430 
and that's less is more so if you don't
have<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.360> many<00:02:14.450> clothes<00:02:14.780> it'll<00:02:15.170> be<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> lot

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
have as many clothes it'll be a lot

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.750 
have as many clothes it'll be a lot
easier<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.830> hang<00:02:16.010> up<00:02:16.130> everything<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
easier to hang up everything that you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.670 
easier to hang up everything that you
own<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.360> you're<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:17.989> sure<00:02:18.200> what<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.620> rid

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
own if you're not sure what to get rid

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.560 
own if you're not sure what to get rid
of<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:19.310> tip<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.700> enjoy<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
of one tip that I enjoy is that the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.640 
of one tip that I enjoy is that the
first<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.959> every<00:02:21.080> month

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
first of every month

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.790 
first of every month
flip<00:02:22.070> all<00:02:22.250> your<00:02:22.520> hangers<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.090> reverse<00:02:23.450> way<00:02:23.800> so

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
flip all your hangers the reverse way so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.040 
flip all your hangers the reverse way so
if<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.160> normally<00:02:25.550> put<00:02:25.760> them<00:02:25.940> frontwards<00:02:26.420> put

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
if you normally put them frontwards put

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.000 
if you normally put them frontwards put
them<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.320> backwards

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
them in backwards

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.690 
them in backwards
and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:29.660> as<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.080> wear<00:02:30.290> an<00:02:30.440> item<00:02:30.770> when<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.580> go

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
to put it away you're gonna flip the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.040 
to put it away you're gonna flip the
hanger<00:02:33.890> back<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.610> normal<00:02:34.910> way<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.870> if

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
hanger back the normal way so that if

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.420
