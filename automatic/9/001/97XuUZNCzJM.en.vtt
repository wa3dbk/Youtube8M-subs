00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 applications created what is in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.160
 iphone ipod touch device or ipad 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 completely free without the need of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.029
 hack our device how to do 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 what this will do is download it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.599
 what is beta 2 that I am going to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 leave in the description of the video is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.669
 this program that we see here we are here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.950
 you will download it and it will 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.750
 install we are going to install it so that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.969
 you can appreciate to see how you see if 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.780
 you do not know what we 're going to open we 're going to give 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.129
 following 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.500
 we accept the science terminals the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
 next next next until 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.399
 it is installed what is the program it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.920
 we remove the popcorn and we give 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.899
 finished well once installed it's going 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 to look like what this icon is here 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.340
 very similar to the previous one only that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.370
 the only thing that changes is the version and it's 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.940
 a beta 2 when we open it goes to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.559
 work equally d 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.560
 of what Likewise anyway 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.329
 like the previous one but 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.229
 to be able to download your applications 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.930
 install them automatically 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.390
 device without the need to have what 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.100
 saying boils well until 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.689
 we're all fine now a very note 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.030
 important there are many users that I 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.729
 are sending comments that when 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.320
 download an application asks what 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.810
 is the apollo 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.610
 that did not happen to me because I did this 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.380
 solution what you have to do 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.070
 is to connect your device either a 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.960
 iphone 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.460
 tensing the body cough or any 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.039
 any device that you have 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.229
 connect you, we are going to click here 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.659
 is the screwdriver this as well as the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.759
 for tools if it's not going to be what 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.799
 is this window me here in the translation 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.630
 I can not tell you anything because I do not know anything 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.030
 of Chinese but then they have to do 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.539
 is to click on the green button and it goes 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.340
 to start making a solution which 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.080
 He will no longer ask us for what is the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.509
 arch the idea they just have to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 wait for it to end and in the end it 's here 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.650
 Wherever I suppose they don 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.470
 English well 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.530
 let's wait I want to thank you 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.790
 all the followers that are being me 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.070
 on twitter the truth many thanks 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.160
 all of you very good tension 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.560
 Happy Christmas and a happy new year 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.120
 new and good because here it's over 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.370
 that is the program already have the three 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.380
 correct popcorn we give you in the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.790
 button to close and now 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.630
 can we download 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.340
 Free applications for our 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.860
 positive that you will not ask for what 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.570
 is the apo the idea I suppose not only 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.130
 ask because there is a month loaded several 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.420
 applications the truth is that it has not 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.050
 asked for no paper 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.170
 I have the most wanted I have this out of the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.420
 water and he has not asked me for anything else 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.730
 It is also that the program has 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.680
 free applications of the teacher 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.300
 so they have to check very well what 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.580
 application are downloading maybe 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.730
 they are going down the light and not the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.370
 payment so they have to see that one 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.080
 way to know that is the training 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.730
 the size of the game 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 for example the most wanted the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.500
 trial version I do not know if it is available 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.080
 in the appstore 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.590
 but if it be never going to weigh 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.860
 607 megabytes goes despite 300 or 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.010
 200 or hundreds typical megabytes the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.930
 original game weighs 607 megabytes and 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.950
 when you install it on the device I think 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.330
 that increases more the size here below to 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.330
 identify if the game is compatible 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.820
 with your iphone ipod or ipad is going to say 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.010
 iphone and ipad and if it says iphone it's because 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.810
 also compatible with iphone and 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.420
 only if only for ipad is 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.920
 here I am going to say the air and here is 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.700
 the version that they need that is a 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.010
 4.0 version go forward and good more 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.840
 information here you can find it and 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.520
 good friends, I say goodbye with a greeting 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.380
