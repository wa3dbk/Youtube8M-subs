00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
let's kill our losses by a bit so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
let's kill our losses by a bit so
instead<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.289> spending<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.949> 300<00:00:32.610> gold<00:00:32.790> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
instead of spending like 300 gold we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
instead of spending like 300 gold we
only<00:00:33.270> spent<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.600> 20<00:00:33.840> 40<00:00:34.170> thousand<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.649> that's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
only spent like 20 40 thousand so that's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430 
only spent like 20 40 thousand so that's
good<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:36.270> I'm<00:00:36.780> waiting<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.110> like

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
good and then I'm waiting for like

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.319 
good and then I'm waiting for like
another<00:00:37.710> event<00:00:38.070> where<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.670> four

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
another event where they do like four

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.869 
another event where they do like four
times<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.870> research<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.520> research

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
times the research that you get research

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
times the research that you get research
points<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.510> even<00:00:42.750> though<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.530> actually

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
points but even though it's actually

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
points but even though it's actually
compared<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.280> points<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.210> right<00:00:45.450> now

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
compared two points from like right now

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
compared two points from like right now
and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> compare<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.129> point<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and then you compare that point that you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.069 
and then you compare that point that you
can<00:00:47.820> get<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.629> point<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> need<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
can get and the point you need for the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
can get and the point you need for the
boosted<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.260> keen<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> events<00:00:53.219> es<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.820> notice

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
boosted a keen of events es will notice

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.670 
boosted a keen of events es will notice
that<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.480> actually<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.440> don't<00:00:55.590> really

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that it's actually that you don't really

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
that it's actually that you don't really
get<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> lot<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.850> it's

super wonder works if you guys did not
know<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.160> basically<00:02:20.580> go<00:02:21.030> there<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.480> then<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
know I basically go there and then you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
know I basically go there and then you
you're<00:02:22.830> hoping<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.600> good

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you're hoping that you have really good

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.300 
you're hoping that you have really good
cores<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.230> basically<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.830> happens<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.250> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
cores and basically what happens is that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.260 
cores and basically what happens is that
whichever<00:02:27.740> alliances<00:02:28.740> leader<00:02:29.120> holds<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
whichever alliances leader holds the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.390 
whichever alliances leader holds the
Wonder<00:02:30.810> time<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.380> longest<00:02:31.800> win<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.220> for

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
Wonder time the longest win so for

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.630 
Wonder time the longest win so for
example<00:02:32.459> uh<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:34.140> tool<00:02:34.410> big<00:02:35.040> alliances

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
example uh this tool big alliances

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.990 
example uh this tool big alliances
alliance<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.660> hold<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.320> first<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:38.430> 15

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
alliance a hold it for the first like 15

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.210 
alliance a hold it for the first like 15
hours<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.600> then<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> lines<00:02:40.080> behold<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.890> for

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
hours and then the lines behold it for

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.970 
hours and then the lines behold it for
like<00:02:41.310> last<00:02:41.640> eight<00:02:42.300> hours<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.680> guys<00:02:43.860> would

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
like last eight hours you guys would

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
like last eight hours you guys would
think<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.640> purse<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.239> last<00:02:45.510> person

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
think that the purse like last person

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.410 
think that the purse like last person
who<00:02:46.320> held<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.100> Wonder<00:02:47.550> will<00:02:47.910> win<00:02:48.120> but

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
who held the Wonder will win but

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.390 
who held the Wonder will win but
incorrect<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.320> actually<00:02:49.709> whichever

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
incorrect it's actually whichever

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.940 
incorrect it's actually whichever
Alliance<00:02:51.000> gets<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.170> hold<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> longest

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
Alliance gets to hold it the longest

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
Alliance gets to hold it the longest
wins<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.820> hold<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.600> longest

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
wins so if you hold it for the longest

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.020 
wins so if you hold it for the longest
the<00:02:55.560> leader<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.890> Alliance<00:02:56.370> wins<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> he

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the leader that Alliance wins and he

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.460 
the leader that Alliance wins and he
becomes<00:02:57.300> Emperor<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.900> that's<00:02:58.050> how<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.260> works

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
becomes Emperor so that's how it works

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.680 
becomes Emperor so that's how it works
and<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.489> time<00:02:59.700> could<00:02:59.880> put<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> 1<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.570> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
and then this time could put a 1 so that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.080 
and then this time could put a 1 so that
means<00:03:00.900> he<00:03:01.080> gets<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.100> first<00:03:02.459> item

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
means he gets to have the first item

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.520 
means he gets to have the first item
that<00:03:03.209> machine<00:03:03.480> zone<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.750> giving<00:03:04.019> outs<00:03:04.200> for

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that machine zone is giving outs for

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.979 
that machine zone is giving outs for
Emperor's<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.519> is<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.000> helmet<00:03:06.750> I'd<00:03:06.959> oh
