00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 It is obviously to eliminate toxins 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.830
 toxins can come from many things 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.629
 I did not drink or we were good 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.760
 well santiago breathes the whole idea that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.889
 it's dirty inside there's nothing 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.330
 do with that question the meals of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 balance to all things come with 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 as all the color dye additives of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.510
 all kinds sugar sugar is a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.430
 poison also get a lot of salt tam in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 all that is going around then 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.449
 after 4 days you realize that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.609
 the boy I'm talking about the channel 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.189
 DÃ­az the aborigine was ready he was 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.340
 pure clean and there with the diner well 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 like you see how it feels and they started 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 understand the environment and all dad everything is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 began to open as in hd have seen 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.989
 as well as when one sees a movie 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.410
 old in bhs and then the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.450
 blu-ray version 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.309
 it's like understanding everything seeing everything looks like this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 as pristine because your mind is 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.890
 cleared is not the whole body as it has 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 been the last decade working 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 infinitely all day taking out the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.050
 crap that you for not wanting your body 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.359
 milk and sometimes because you do not know no one 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.820
 he eats and he is reading it work in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.430
 his body exploded then he says 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 today thank you for the rest now I can 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.190
 to be beats me quiet 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.410
 which is to eliminate toxins which is what 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.870
 wants your body to keep you healthy one of the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.880
 that does not leave it in the background you get the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.370
 rolls of the head you take off let's say the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
 bad mood you start placidly 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.100
 understand listen to these slow but 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.970
 awake and vigorous the vigor is extended 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.060
 sexual good and you agree 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.670
 it is true that the announcement that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.050
 increased in palmira and magnetic only 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 I can express well I'm ready and 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.790
 willing I can put out a fire if 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.979
 you want no problem 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.380
 absolutely and finally this after 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.220
 of the tenth day it is finished is taken out 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.159
 of the maple and palm tree 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.950
 exactly and wait for me in some 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.710
 start I said may be orange and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.649
 It gave him a lot of lemon juice because 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.200
 because at the molecular level in the link the 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.920
 structure between salt and lemon well 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.750
 I'll be sweeping quickly with 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.580
 what you mix it at the same time it is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.760
 like a little more bugs in two liters of 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.800
 water now integrated this 2d or into the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.739
 syrup background plus two lemon fingers 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.980
 in two liters of water 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.980
 during the day 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.150
 exact street nothing but fell 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.769
 because the pepper because the pepper 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.750
 have a warmth and will be circulating 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.000
 faster the blood and the process will 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.150
 accelerates and will push you more laps 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.100
 outside that the previous time we talked 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.780
 of that excess fat when one 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.680
 begins to gain weight has to do with 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.900
 what 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.700
 the simulation of the excess food that 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500
 one does is that the body does not have the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.719
 ability to do all the work 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.219
 to be able to eliminate them and then the 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.319
 discipline becomes a molecule 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.450
 which is encapsulated and remains as work 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.829
 for more time but it is also harmful 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.049
 because that work that remains for more 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.790
 time is still running and 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.040
 also you can in a certain way be 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.900
 turn into something harmful to health and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.639
 out there they start to manifest another 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
 type of ailment in the body by 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.310
 course I know what that should do 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.129
 You can know how you are explaining it 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.810
 is that it attacks is that thing is that 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.459
 molecule that is eradicated long ago 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.230
 time ago excellent note that 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.419
 we some time we present the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.000
 Tibetans who are still arriving many 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.560
 thank you all but share eye and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.569
 my dad got up again I can not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.099
 believe it low glycemia 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.400
 I do not have a problem with diabetes and so on 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.989
 et cetera but this I do not even want 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.379
 to pronounce only I want to say that you 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.230
 cure a level of mental depth and 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.180
 physical 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.290
 awesome or I swear it is 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.940
 incredibly recommend to all 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.380
 who do not know that what he serves is 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.780
 I knew the best they felt captivated 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.900
 with what you said and because it's a team 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.900
 already started salfate is always felipe
