and<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> other<00:01:27.450> wire<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.290> black<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and the other wire that's all black is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
and the other wire that's all black is
like<00:01:29.070> round<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.670> we'll<00:01:29.760> connect<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like round and we'll connect out to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
like round and we'll connect out to
remaining<00:01:30.720> black<00:01:30.960> wire<00:01:31.229> from<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.620> backup

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
now before we tape everything up well go

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.980 
now before we tape everything up well go
ahead<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.850> test<00:01:36.210> our<00:01:36.390> connections<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.869> make

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
ahead and test our connections and make
sure<00:01:37.110> everything's<00:01:37.440> good<00:01:37.650> we're<00:01:37.950> careful<00:01:38.190> if

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sure everything's good we're careful if

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
sure everything's good we're careful if
we<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.580> go<00:01:38.670> ahead<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:38.970> take<00:01:39.090> our<00:01:39.270> clamp<00:01:39.750> from

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
we can go ahead and take our clamp from

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
we can go ahead and take our clamp from
our<00:01:40.110> tester<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.619> put<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.010> ground<00:01:41.220> wire

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
our tester and put it on the ground wire

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.070 
our tester and put it on the ground wire
and<00:01:41.640> make<00:01:41.880> sure<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.090> touches<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.660> metal<00:01:42.900> band

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
and make sure it touches the metal band

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.140 
and make sure it touches the metal band
then<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.590> metal<00:01:43.860> band<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.430> completes

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
then this metal band actually completes

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.820 
then this metal band actually completes
the<00:01:45.210> circuit<00:01:45.479> between<00:01:45.600> both<00:01:46.050> wires<00:01:46.350> well<00:01:46.740> go

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
the circuit between both wires well go

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.960 
the circuit between both wires well go
ahead<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.040> put<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> car<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.460> reverse<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
ahead and put the car in reverse and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
ahead and put the car in reverse and
then<00:01:48.330> check<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> other<00:01:48.990> wire<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.770> have

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
then check the other wire so if we have

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.130 
then check the other wire so if we have
signal<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.400> our<00:01:50.520> connections<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:50.970> good

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
signal we know our connections are good

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.210 
signal we know our connections are good
and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.229> we'll<00:01:52.350> go<00:01:52.470> ahead<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> secure<00:01:52.830> some

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and then we'll go ahead and secure some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.680 
and then we'll go ahead and secure some
electric<00:01:53.520> tape<00:01:56.090> then<00:01:57.090> we'll<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.420> ahead<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
electric tape then we'll go ahead and

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.749 
electric tape then we'll go ahead and
secure<00:01:57.930> wires<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.619> needed<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.460> some<00:01:59.580> zip

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
secure wires as needed with some zip

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.870 
secure wires as needed with some zip
ties<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:04.890> reinstall<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.399> backup

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
ties and then reinstall the backup

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.430 
ties and then reinstall the backup
