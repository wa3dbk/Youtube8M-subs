00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 si 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:30.649
 Becker and I are at the running track 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.680
 historical route berlin marathon where 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.809
 we all want to go there 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.970
 Distance is very important for beginners 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.420
 is scary important motivation why 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.760
 only knows exactly how far I walk 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.550
 because she is a recipient of gps data 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.720
 that means via the satellite to how 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.629
 the navi in ​​the car works 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.239
 percent deviation and when I as 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.760
 beginner has run once 94 km 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.559
 That's what we thought he would be then 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.189
 you never say single-digit again 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.689
 the 600 meter is never the same again 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:07.400
 I probably installed it 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.009
 more boys confirmed totally 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.250
 Exciting finds distance estimate from 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.470
 Wall Memorial Street 17 July 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.659
 To the edge of the roundabout of the Golden Else 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.340
 there and back 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:25.630
 1800 meter the baker says 1800 1900 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.630
 countries to solve get started 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.079
 wittstock of tomorrow think to the edge 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 the gold elf known in 1800 I appreciated 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.520
 1900 the incorruptible cause 2320 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.710
 meter here so that's our name 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.689
 are only 40 kilometers from marathon 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.420
 first and secondly you have removed 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.939
 I estimate you are about 400 meters at 400 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 thanks to this clock we know we are running 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.390
 that's much further than we estimate 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.929
 not nice 40 more about it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929
 marathon
