00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.960 
no come on that part's hard that part is
difficult<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.549> sure<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.789> the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
difficult but I'm pretty sure this the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.690 
difficult but I'm pretty sure this the
exact<00:02:00.299> set<00:02:00.539> up<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.080> same<00:02:01.259> thing

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
exact set up right here the same thing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.219 
exact set up right here the same thing
okay<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.179> think<00:02:03.270> we've<00:02:03.509> done<00:02:03.659> five<00:02:03.899> turns

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
okay so I think we've done five turns

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.960 
okay so I think we've done five turns
because<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.619> other<00:02:04.770> two<00:02:04.979> were<00:02:05.220> practice<00:02:05.729> runs

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
because the other two were practice runs

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.639 
because the other two were practice runs
but<00:02:06.720> he's<00:02:06.840> using<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> scoreboard<00:02:07.470> feature

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
but he's using the scoreboard feature

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.789 
but he's using the scoreboard feature
which<00:02:07.799> i<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.310> cool<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.799> that's

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
which i think is really cool and that's

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.380 
which i think is really cool and that's
always<00:02:11.100> got<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> most<00:02:11.430> innovative<00:02:11.670> things<00:02:12.180> as

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
always got the most innovative things as

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.130 
always got the most innovative things as
you<00:02:12.480> guys<00:02:12.630> already<00:02:13.380> know<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:14.040> course<00:02:15.140> so

excessive intervals it looks like a

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.309 
excessive intervals it looks like a
little<00:02:20.850> bit<00:02:21.000> random<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:21.989> gonna<00:02:22.170> be

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
