of destruction that's been thrown at it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.959 
of destruction that's been thrown at it
by<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.229> game<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:48.009> top<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.399> yeah<00:01:48.729> we<00:01:48.850> also

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
by the game on top of that yeah we also

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.490 
by the game on top of that yeah we also
want<00:01:49.270> kind<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.719> design<00:01:49.930> them<00:01:49.960> from<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.259> ground

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
want kind of design them from the ground

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.679 
want kind of design them from the ground
up<00:01:50.649> is<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.920> TV<00:01:51.159> show<00:01:51.579> so<00:01:51.909> essentially<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
up is this a TV show so essentially the

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.840 
up is this a TV show so essentially the
TV<00:01:52.960> company<00:01:53.320> have<00:01:53.799> created<00:01:54.280> these<00:01:54.430> vehicles

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
TV company have created these vehicles

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.760 
TV company have created these vehicles
and<00:01:55.539> they've<00:01:55.719> also<00:01:55.869> designed<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.320> vehicles

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
and they've also designed the vehicles

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.230 
and they've also designed the vehicles
so<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.189> there<00:01:57.490> are<00:01:57.579> spectacular<00:01:58.119> as<00:01:58.180> they

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
so that there are spectacular as they

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.789 
so that there are spectacular as they
possibly<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.780> be<00:01:58.840> when<00:01:59.079> they<00:01:59.170> crash<00:01:59.439> or<00:01:59.680> when

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
possibly can be when they crash or when

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.950 
possibly can be when they crash or when
they<00:01:59.890> get<00:02:00.009> hit<00:02:00.189> by<00:02:00.340> building<00:02:00.789> or<00:02:01.000> by<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.180> ship<00:02:01.689> or

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
they get hit by building or by a ship or

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.249 
they get hit by building or by a ship or
other<00:02:02.469> vehicles<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.969> don't<00:02:04.119> want<00:02:04.299> one<00:02:04.450> car<00:02:04.719> to

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
other vehicles we don't want one car to

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.440 
other vehicles we don't want one car to
be<00:02:05.409> Mars<00:02:05.950> faster<00:02:06.250> than<00:02:06.460> others<00:02:06.850> ultimately

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
be Mars faster than others ultimately

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.580 
be Mars faster than others ultimately
all<00:02:07.600> need<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.810> be<00:02:07.869> competitive

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
all need to be competitive

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.169 
all need to be competitive
so<00:02:08.950> really<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:09.340> more<00:02:09.489> about<00:02:09.640> their<00:02:09.820> handling

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
so really it's more about their handling

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.880 
so really it's more about their handling
characteristics<00:02:10.630> rather<00:02:11.350> than<00:02:11.650> their

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
characteristics rather than their

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.830 
characteristics rather than their
handling<00:02:12.280> abilities<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.090> almost<00:02:13.359> a<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.570> car

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
handling abilities it's almost a the car

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.819 
handling abilities it's almost a the car
can<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.049> start<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.350> where<00:02:14.470> they're<00:02:14.680> going

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
can we start all where they're going

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.099 
can we start all where they're going
they<00:02:14.950> can<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.579> like<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.299> say<00:02:16.450> because<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
they can do and like I say because the

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.990 
they can do and like I say because the
stickers<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.040> car<00:02:18.070> evolving<00:02:18.730> with<00:02:18.880> you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
stickers on the car evolving with you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
stickers on the car evolving with you
and<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.209> bodywork<00:02:19.600> it'll<00:02:20.530> show<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.799> you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
and the bodywork it'll show that you

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.319 
and the bodywork it'll show that you
invested<00:02:21.400> more<00:02:21.519> time<00:02:21.700> with<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:21.940> car<00:02:22.150> than

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
invested more time with that car than

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:22.750 
invested more time with that car than
someone

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
someone

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.520 
someone
just<00:02:22.879> played<00:02:23.629> through<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:24.049> get<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.349> cars

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
just played through to get all the cars

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.140 
just played through to get all the cars
individual<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.430> know<00:02:25.549> personalized
