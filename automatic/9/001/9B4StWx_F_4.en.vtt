00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
think it was about $250 but it was a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.060 
think it was about $250 but it was a
lifesaver<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.690> can't<00:03:17.930> mix<00:03:18.200> 30<00:03:18.500> bags<00:03:18.770> of

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
lifesaver you can't mix 30 bags of

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.690 
lifesaver you can't mix 30 bags of
concrete<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:20.690> rapid<00:03:21.140> fashion<00:03:21.520> unless<00:03:22.520> you've

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
concrete in rapid fashion unless you've

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.240 
concrete in rapid fashion unless you've
got<00:03:22.880> something<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:23.990> so<00:03:24.290> renting<00:03:25.160> it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
got something like this so renting it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.250 
got something like this so renting it
was<00:03:25.340> $50<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> day<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.150> figured<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.900> might<00:03:27.140> end

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
was $50 a day I figured that I might end

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.780 
was $50 a day I figured that I might end
up<00:03:27.410> using<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.800> for<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.980> few<00:03:28.160> days<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.520> figured

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
up using it for a few days so I figured

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.990 
up using it for a few days so I figured
I'd<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:28.910> buy<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.680> loved<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:31.370> here's

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
about three foot down below this slab at

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.020 
about three foot down below this slab at
the<00:03:54.110> top<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.530> all<00:03:54.680> new<00:03:54.890> so<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.220> kind<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.580> laid<00:03:55.790> it

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
the top is all new so I kind of laid it
