notice<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.200> I've<00:02:07.290> got<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:07.920> bit<00:02:08.039> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
notice that I've got a little bit of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.559 
notice that I've got a little bit of
duct<00:02:08.280> tape<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.729> about<00:02:08.909> two<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.269> a<00:02:09.420> half

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
duct tape it's about two and a half

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.390 
duct tape it's about two and a half
meters<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> always<00:02:10.349> fold<00:02:11.069> over<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
meters here I always fold over the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.369 
meters here I always fold over the
corner<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.569> easy<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.110> get<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
corner so it's easy just to get your

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.899 
corner so it's easy just to get your
thumb<00:02:13.680> underneath<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.190> peel<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.489> back<00:02:14.640> it's

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
thumb underneath and peel it back it's

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.880 
thumb underneath and peel it back it's
been<00:02:15.150> on<00:02:15.239> here<00:02:15.390> for<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.659> six<00:02:15.870> months<00:02:16.080> it's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
just a little bit more and place it back

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.720 
just a little bit more and place it back
on<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> other<00:02:39.150> three<00:02:39.660> poles<00:02:40.730> free

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
on to the other three poles free

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.440 
on to the other three poles free
bachelor<00:02:42.090> poles<00:02:42.770> there's<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.860> smaller<00:02:44.130> version

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
bachelor poles there's a smaller version

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.530 
bachelor poles there's a smaller version
of<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.950> comes<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.489> from<00:02:48.239> about<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
of this that comes in from about the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.260 
of this that comes in from about the
base<00:02:48.720> plate<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.489> it's<00:02:50.489> about<00:02:50.580> where<00:02:50.910> my<00:02:51.000> hand

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
base plate here it's about where my hand

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.699 
base plate here it's about where my hand
is<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.110> course<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> smaller

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
is here so of course it's a smaller

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.650 
is here so of course it's a smaller
version<00:02:52.920> maybe<00:02:53.250> easier<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.790> pack<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.330> put<00:02:54.510> into

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
version maybe easier to pack to put into

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.050 
version maybe easier to pack to put into

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
things 53 centimeters but the maximum

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.120 
things 53 centimeters but the maximum
height<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:03.510> won't<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:04.050> more<00:03:04.200> than<00:03:04.350> about<00:03:04.440> 85

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
height you won't get more than about 85

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.240 
height you won't get more than about 85
to<00:03:05.340> 87<00:03:05.989> apex<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.560> you're<00:03:07.769> not<00:03:07.890> gonna<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.100> any

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
really really petite or small so I've

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.880 
really really petite or small so I've
got<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.300> longer<00:03:12.540> motion<00:03:12.870> here<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.319> have<00:03:13.620> used

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
got the longer motion here I have used

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.729 
got the longer motion here I have used
as<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.489> would<00:03:14.610> have<00:03:14.700> seen<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:15.090> some<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.450> my

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
as you would have seen in some of my

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.930 
as you would have seen in some of my
camping<00:03:16.739> videos<00:03:17.069> where<00:03:17.340> I've<00:03:17.430> had<00:03:17.640> them<00:03:17.790> all

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
camping videos where I've had them all

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.990 
camping videos where I've had them all
of<00:03:18.450> their<00:03:18.600> maximum<00:03:19.050> height<00:03:19.850> extending<00:03:20.850> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
of their maximum height extending and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520 
of their maximum height extending and
having<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.390> four<00:03:21.660> corners<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.319> then

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
having on the four corners and then

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.759 
having on the four corners and then
that's<00:03:22.739> meant<00:03:22.980> my<00:03:23.190> shelter<00:03:24.290> roof<00:03:25.290> has<00:03:25.739> been

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
that's meant my shelter roof has been

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.190 
that's meant my shelter roof has been
all<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.580> same<00:03:27.090> level<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.720> way<00:03:27.840> through

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
all the same level all the way through

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.539 
all the same level all the way through
so<00:03:28.350> there's<00:03:28.470> lots<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.860> space<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.250> move<00:03:29.400> around

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
so there's lots of space to move around

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.620 
so there's lots of space to move around
it<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.390> that's<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.780> telescopic<00:03:31.410> basher<00:03:32.250> pole

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
it so that's the telescopic basher pole

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.280 
it so that's the telescopic basher pole
