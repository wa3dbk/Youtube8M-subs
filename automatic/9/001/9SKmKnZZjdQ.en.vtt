you can go anywhere and you can drag

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:55.940 
you can go anywhere and you can drag
your<00:00:44.430> windows<00:00:47.870> along

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.020 

and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.440 
and
and<00:00:58.149> basically

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
and basically

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.930 
and basically
to<00:01:01.050> give<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.890> idea<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.310> how<00:01:02.370> big<00:01:02.550> your

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
to give you an idea of how big your

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.220 
to give you an idea of how big your
desktop<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:06.000> show<00:01:07.010> map<00:01:08.010> option

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
desktop is now is this show map option

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.920 
desktop is now is this show map option
so<00:01:10.230> this<00:01:10.440> is<00:01:10.470> how<00:01:10.920> big<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.640> desktop<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.300> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so this is how big your desktop is and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
so this is how big your desktop is and
these<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:13.980> your<00:01:14.250> windows<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:17.130> all

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
these are your windows so I can go all

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.270 
these are your windows so I can go all
the<00:01:17.340> way<00:01:17.520> down<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.510> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the way down if I want to so there you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.469 
the way down if I want to so there you
go<00:01:23.510> so<00:01:24.510> that<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.050> spear<00:01:25.950> XP<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.120> basically

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
go so that is spear XP what it basically

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
go so that is spear XP what it basically
does<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.490> gives<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.000> or<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.770> basically

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
does is give you this um 3d effect and I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.900 
does is give you this um 3d effect and I
think<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.350> cool<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.310> really

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
think it's pretty cool because it really

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.590 
think it's pretty cool because it really
x<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.550> desktop<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.900> is

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
x and the my desktop so that is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.440 
x and the my desktop so that is
spherical<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> close<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
spherical you I'm just going to close it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
spherical you I'm just going to close it
to<00:01:51.720> show<00:01:51.930> another<00:01:52.229> program<00:01:56.300> okay

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.840 

sphere<00:02:05.740> XP<00:02:07.080> there<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.170> go<00:02:10.350> yes<00:02:11.350> okay<00:02:12.280> another

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
sphere XP there you go yes okay another

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.550 
sphere XP there you go yes okay another
program<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.360> i'm<00:02:13.600> going<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.020> show<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.230> is

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
program that i'm going to show you is

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.230 
program that i'm going to show you is
called<00:02:14.710> zoom<00:02:15.610> open<00:02:16.030> another<00:02:17.020> um<00:02:17.970> sure<00:02:18.970> where

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
called zoom open another um sure where

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.100 
called zoom open another um sure where
but<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.440> always<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.280> demo<00:02:24.490> version

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
but you can always have the demo version

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.070 
but you can always have the demo version
so<00:02:26.110> when<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.040> basically<00:02:27.460> does<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.540> time<00:02:28.750> is

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
so when it basically does this time is

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.410 
so when it basically does this time is
to<00:02:29.440> give<00:02:30.400> your<00:02:31.650> windows<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:33.070> cool<00:02:33.940> effects

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
to give your windows this cool effects

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.460 
to give your windows this cool effects
when<00:02:34.810> closing<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:36.240> putting<00:02:37.240> them<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:40.230> let's<00:02:41.230> go

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
when closing or putting them so let's go

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.630 
when closing or putting them so let's go
to<00:02:41.530> settings<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:43.600> open<00:02:44.080> effect<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.650> spin<00:02:45.130> open

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
to settings so open effect is spin open

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.580 
to settings so open effect is spin open
and<00:02:45.940> close<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.360> fact<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.610> don't<00:02:48.610> know

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and close the fact is I don't know

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.410 
and close the fact is I don't know
collapse<00:02:51.150> by<00:02:52.590> okay<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.730> minimize<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
collapse by okay going to minimize the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.320 
collapse by okay going to minimize the
windows<00:02:56.110> we<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.530> see<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.490> going<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.730> close<00:03:01.060> is

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
windows we can see so going to close is

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:10.280 
windows we can see so going to close is
open<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:05.620> gives<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.420> school<00:03:07.420> effects

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:20.470 

so<00:03:11.290> another<00:03:11.560> effect<00:03:13.140> closing<00:03:14.970> fade<00:03:15.970> out

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.950 

there<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.600> go<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.950> open<00:03:26.960> last

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
there you go so that is open last

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.140 
there you go so that is open last
program<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.560> i'm<00:03:28.710> going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.980> show<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
program that i'm going to show you this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.960 
program that i'm going to show you this
time<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:31.020> free<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.980> might<00:03:32.760> have

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
time it is for free and you might have

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.550 
time it is for free and you might have
had<00:03:33.530> well<00:03:34.820> heard<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.150> or<00:03:36.540> maybe<00:03:37.020> try<00:03:37.500> this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
had well heard of this or maybe try this
