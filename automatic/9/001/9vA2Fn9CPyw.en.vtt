00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.750
 I'll introduce next is 50 's 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.410
 Fresh arrived this week for us. 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.960
 she family deficit without df and 700 da 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.760
 sony line né that are the ones that more than 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.119
 change, so that this evolution 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.529
 is having digital on then the next 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 she has some questions that are 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.210
 assessed as the exchange of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.150
 lenses the economy back presenting 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.850
 now for you are the first step is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.160
 What I liked about this camera was the fact that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 have a question about saw fire has civilian 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.200
 It's time to record during the daytime. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 greater control of light, the fact that it is 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 also I can record the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.190
 campaign is to be able to have a 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.960
 control that I'm recording right now. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 thus correcting something that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.629
 I have in my image from any angle 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.320
 that I record with the camera with you 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 seeing this image in a correct way 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 the points that are important 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 she comes with a 18 200 lens she has 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.189
 a blue bike on the then the lens with a 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.340
 zoom is mechanical then for those who work 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.040
 with the event for who has to record 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.409
 something more dynamic this lens 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 website allows you to make a closing 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.150
 June opening is both a great 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 hole with matter in 200 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 then need not need exchange of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.630
 lenses that are often not 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 even in the event 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.520
 Our camera already has that which is cool, huh? 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.350
 another important worthwhile factor 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.750
 evaluate that it already records 1080p and 1080p 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 progressive scan full frame 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.270
 hd 1080p 1920 60 frames are the people 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.100
 try to have slack or progressive with 60 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.490
 progressive frames 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.890
 I just want to record and was the appropriate 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.829
 slow to handle in after in software 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.049
 3d or even after I have 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.750
 no work to conclude that she had 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.420
 a video on 24 on 30 other 60 original 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.440
 with 1080p 60 I can 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630
 so you have to evaluate what are 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.230
 few beds 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.870
 but that record in 1080p 60 p ends up being 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.120
 a great differential of this line 9 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.310
 new segment of large sensors in this 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.960
 campaign already has this possibility 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.440
 something else that is interesting that has 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.410
 a sensor after a sensor that it is of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.510
 four texts already the large sensor in 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.330
 relation to the one third half sensor 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.730
 two thirds to be much bigger 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.810
 so essential in the art allows to have a 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.640
 less noise 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.740
 then other points that are explained 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.400
 also interesting that it is the fact that 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.440
 have a digital zoom, but it 's a digital 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.540
 that it in the sensor without losing 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.480
 resolution that the mechanism 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.270
 interesting she has entered xlr de 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.160
 audio is two balanced inputs then 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.370
 you can have an audio in both the 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.220
 compression of the digital bo like lpcm which is 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.120
 a smaller compression in length and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.320
 so much ne 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.090
 so you can have these 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.720
 possibilities without time limit of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.270
 recording is not that neither at 10 nr are she 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.220
 has a question of really a camera 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.860
 video the proposal of a camera 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.890
 video with camera features 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.130
 dslr that conquered market by texture 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.920
 that it raises the question 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.040
 economic on the camera back 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.110
 I can easily pull to work 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.960
 with it on the shoulder so it facilitates 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.520
 camera operation so you 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.740
 has greater comfort if an issue 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.320
 including using 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.570
 place has a lot of sun 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.450
 then you can have that control 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.790
 both the light is like the comfort of 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.430
 work with the camera much larger than 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.030
 If you only win her in the hand then 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.840
 sony thought about this improvement, right? 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.700
 the fact also of the display is theirs and 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.560
 on the side and I can not 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.720
 working from multiple angles is both 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.450
 the camera from below as on top of a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.010
 way much more ergonomic so I 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.050
 I bring the floor to monitor what I am 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.510
 recording so it ends up being very 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.630
 interesting 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.130
 another point worth highlighting is 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.320
 which I think is one of the main 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.600
 shu that the question that everyone has 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.820
 It's when you already have one of these. 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.150
 with your lenses that you do not already have 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.820
 park lumpini with lycra or if it is of a 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.850
 landlord still wait for me 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.380
 I use the machine can is 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.570
 super quiet for you to wear a lens on her 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.750
 of a mark other than that of the 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.630
 sony is not the standard of her mouth cup mount 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.300
 can use lens mount mouth fitting 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.180
 only if you use a lens with the canon 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.400
 skin if then adapter adapter zinho 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.670
 that puts between the original mouth of the camera 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.800
 and the lens you make that adaptation that is 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.230
 easy is quiet and has some 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.390
 adapters that are already electronic 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.610
 if you can make iris today then 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.070
 this is very interesting for 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.750
 who already has the line of lenses is 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.430
 series F 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.190
 So you can already work with 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.820
 these lenses in a very easy way 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.530
 huh 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.590
 Can you do everything with the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.240
 irs forests and their transition to 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.130
 it's 50 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.100
 with these improvements that we propose 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.410
 So you use the only lens 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.960
 detail is you see the adapter that is 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.070
 needed for the lenses you already own 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.470
 We have some letters that 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.110
 here in the store, and when 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.140
 You change the lens of a camera. 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.810
 component the image texture that 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.690
 impressive at short depth 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.800
 field in a dark place you can 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.490
 work in a much more 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.080
 quietly, particularly to a 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.750
 gain of quality and quantity is very 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.420
 big then the lens change if you 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.410
 already has evaluates what it's worth is 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.850
 an action that will give a good differential 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.040
 interesting even for a lay person 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.740
 who does not understand much of video only sees 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.710
 This will notice this difference. 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.080
 I'm with sensor is now right that the the 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.850
 pse with the photo né 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.970
 a great differential that the size of the 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.520
 sensor then dell sensor while thirds 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.920
 so since I have a bigger sensor it 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.050
 can make a little noise I can 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.470
 have a short depth of field that 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.479
 blur the background then this detail is 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.080
 very cool because it really has a 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.199
 image improvement 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.650
 which is easily perceivable then the 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.960
 her sensor including her photo 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.259
 16 mega one camcorder but already beats 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.330
 photo and in the photo natália option has a 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.560
 mechanical magnification and a machine 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.990
 photographic 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.830
 so this ends up being interesting 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.210
 then it's senex is 51 if you have more 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.710
 any doubt anything else and 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.050
 write here to get in touch 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.969
 with us we are boring all the 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.539
 your doubts regarding equipment 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:05.539
 thank you
