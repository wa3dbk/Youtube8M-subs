00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
just too much options to go with so kind

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.900 
just too much options to go with so kind
of<00:04:39.650> believe<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:40.010> probably<00:04:40.310> for<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.520> best<00:04:40.580> to

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
of believe it's probably for the best to

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.790 
of believe it's probably for the best to
kind<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.419> stage<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:41.870> kind<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:42.320> mattress<00:04:42.500> it
