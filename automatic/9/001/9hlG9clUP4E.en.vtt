00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.570
 Hello everyone here to the baron today I bring you 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.700
 a video more of uncles and of that I know that you 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.430
 like and good if you're fed up with the look 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.110
 minimalist and simple of ios 7 this 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.960
 You may like the video and the one that I am going to 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.390
 teach how to use theme if change 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.720
 a little the operating system so that 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.970
 be more unique and different from others 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.410
 well before starting this video I wanted to 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.720
 tell you what to do what I 'm going to do 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.270
 do I there are several different ways 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.490
 web pages that do I have chosen 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.060
 this application because I think it's the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.800
 what better does it and it's easy to do it 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.600
 and I think it's a good way that what 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.300
 do the only problem is that it costs 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.560
 a little but good I will leave you the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.900
 different ways of doing it in the 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.110
 description different web pages and 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.180
 different 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.960
 ways to do it I hope you like it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.150
 the good video to create any kind 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.950
 of application with an image or 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.840
 alternative to a theme or whatever 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.570
 we will simply have to download 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.149
 and with what is an application that I think 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.899
 it costs a little money but good 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.549
 will be 0 99 nothing nothing excessive and good 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.219
 once we get into this application 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.500
 have different tips we get into 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.959
 anyone and we choose the icon of the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.149
 application that we want for example 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.630
 skype and we give you to add the screen 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.090
 start 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.670
 then we will get the settings type the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.330
 name or link and possibly what 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.490
 we wrote 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.230
 and within the links section we have 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.110
 several we can use it for a 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.080
 application like me in this case or for 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.570
 to redirect us to a web page or 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.910
 to call someone and so on 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.540
 we will simply have to search here 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.530
 skype within applications the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 we select 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.390
 and it's already that easy, then we give it 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.120
 to the tick in the upper right corner and 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.860
 they open us will direct to a page of 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.620
 safari where we will simply have you 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.920
 to give the share icon that is 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.440
 at the bottom of the screen 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.360
 and once we have given it as you can 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.110
 see here we simply add to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.110
 Home screen and you're well on 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.569
 simple is and it will appear to us is not a 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.780
 pure application is simply like a 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.870
 icon that redirect us to skype in 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.150
 this case to any application or 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.590
 any of the options before and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.600
 then we always take you wherever we want 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.930
 and that's it and that's how these are created 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.930
 obligations 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.960
 This application also allows you to create 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.960
 your own applications is to say with the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.720
 image that you want simply the 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.210
 application there is a section that come out more 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.280
 and from here we could create 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.750
 our own application by selecting 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.630
 a background a central image a frame already 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.810
 be of any type 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.660
 and then we can also add it 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.270
 different types of brightness we go what 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.320
 has all the applications 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.660
 well just once we have 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.260
 done this because we will get the same 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.490
 adjustments that with the previous application and 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.560
 I let it be whatever and also 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.990
 we could add any kind of 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.900
 application whatever as before 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.489
 I that is youtube likewise 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.590
 but this time instead of application the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.440
 Web 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.910
 once it is ready, it will take us to safari 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.130
 we will have to repeat the same process 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.030
 of before 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.850
 we add and it will be created the same as 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.090
 we have done it before in a simple way 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.180
 and when you open it, it will not redirect 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.049
 safari and from there already to youtube 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.400
 that I think is very good and 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.400
 everything goes perfectly 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.530
 The next thing I'm going to teach you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.720
 do in this video is going to be create 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.770
 transparent applications as well 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.960
 say it to make it look like you have a 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.550
 icon put where you want inside the 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.790
 home screen the first thing that 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.590
 we have to do is a screenshot in 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.000
 in an area where there is no 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.500
 application and this is done by 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.930
 we simply tighten the applications 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.180
 until they move and we go to the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.100
 last page we go to the website 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.620
 that I have left you the agent description and 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:50.910
 dot and tool font dotcom or something like that and 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.770
 Well, we'll just give it to him 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.130
 that you have seen on the screen we give to 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.090
 modify since I already had it on and 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.840
 give to select file 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.290
 take the photo that you have already made 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.080
 and elections are already once you 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.360
 have then simply you will give to the 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.550
 photographer 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.460
 and once it is there, it will generate the 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.560
 respective transparent applications 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.120
 we select the one that you want me 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.210
 example the above 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.130
 that same one and it will simply take us to 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.740
 a web page where we will have you 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.610
 give the usual add the screen 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.419
 start and you're done 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.129
 or an application will be added to the 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.259
 Start screen at the beginning 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.660
 nothing will appear but if you move it to the 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.990
 zone 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.180
 what have you selected 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.969
 sorry to wait 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.069
 there is 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.709
 as you can see it is totally 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.589
 transparent good is not transparent 

00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:01.589
 but it seems it is a trick that to me 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:03.929
 It seems very funny and very cool and you 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.610
 I recommend that you use it jce and how 

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:07.229
 you can see is a normal icon that is 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.539
 can eliminate or change but having 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.179
 the same image as the background looks like 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.969
 it's transparent finally I'm going to 

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:18.119
 teach a trick that you might like not to 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.949
 I know what your device could do 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:22.319
 a little more unique more different from the 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.349
 other is not a big difference but 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.679
 you may like it for it, we just 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.419
 we will have to go to general adjustments 

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:33.319
 accessibility and we will go down to where 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.639
 put reduce movement before 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.099
 I'm going to show you what it is that 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.929
 changes when I go out or inside a 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.629
 application the own system itself 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:45.299
 create a default animation but 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:48.959
 we can remove it if we add it and we 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:51.209
 it will replace it with a feeling 

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.820
 Normal blur of all life as 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:54.680
 you can see 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.370
 I like it because it makes it more 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.000
 simple and change it a bit for not everything 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.070
 equal and good and you may like it for 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.800
 make it more unique your device if 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.750
 these tricks have not seemed useful to you 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.750
 hesitate to give life and subscribe 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.040
 plus
