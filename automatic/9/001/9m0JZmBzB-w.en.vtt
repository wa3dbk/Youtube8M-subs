00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.529 

so<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.340> started<00:00:17.640> off<00:00:17.760> laying<00:00:18.270> down<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
so I just started off laying down a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.390 
so I just started off laying down a
really<00:00:18.990> rough<00:00:19.170> face<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.710> my<00:00:19.859> Brown<00:00:20.039> hydro

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
really rough face with my Brown hydro

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
really rough face with my Brown hydro
color<00:00:20.580> not<00:00:21.060> worrying<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.660> being<00:00:21.869> even

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
color not worrying about it being even

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.679 
color not worrying about it being even
because<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.949> uneven<00:00:23.519> application<00:00:23.640> helps<00:00:24.359> for

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
because the uneven application helps for

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.800 
because the uneven application helps for
the<00:00:24.810> wood<00:00:24.960> texture<00:00:26.029> once<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.420> down<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the wood texture once that was down I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.089 
the wood texture once that was down I
went<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> grade<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.650> create<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> eye

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
went in with a grade to create the eye

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:52.639 
went in with a grade to create the eye
and<00:00:29.490> mouth<00:00:29.640> outlines

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.049 

with<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.800> black<00:00:54.010> Hydra<00:00:54.340> color<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:54.610> started

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
with the black Hydra color I started

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.400 
with the black Hydra color I started
fully<00:00:55.239> defining<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.780> contours<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.290> I

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
fully defining the contours that I

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.619 
fully defining the contours that I
wanted<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.040> I<00:00:57.340> purposely<00:00:57.730> kept<00:00:58.059> just<00:00:58.270> off<00:00:58.449> the

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
wanted and I purposely kept just off the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.180 
wanted and I purposely kept just off the
gray<00:00:58.840> in<00:00:59.020> some<00:00:59.230> areas<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.590> help<00:00:59.800> give<00:01:00.040> the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
gray in some areas to help give the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.799 
gray in some areas to help give the
illusion<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.730> natural<00:01:01.180> highlight<00:01:01.540> on<00:01:01.690> the

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
illusion of natural highlight on the

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.140 
illusion of natural highlight on the
woodgrain

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.820 

with<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.180> gel<00:01:10.479> eyeliner<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:10.990> went<00:01:11.290> over<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.619> lid

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
with a gel eyeliner I went over the lid

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.770 
with a gel eyeliner I went over the lid
areas<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.490> minimize<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.000> chance<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.330> creasing

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
areas to minimize the chance of creasing

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.330 
areas to minimize the chance of creasing
and<00:01:13.930> then<00:01:14.320> filled<00:01:14.590> in<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.830> edges<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.310> eye

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
and then filled in the edges of the eye

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:28.750 
and then filled in the edges of the eye
shapes<00:01:15.700> with<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:15.970> Hydra<00:01:16.299> color

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.110 

I<00:01:29.500> also<00:01:30.500> started<00:01:30.950> creating<00:01:31.280> fake<00:01:31.550> edges<00:01:31.910> on

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
I also started creating fake edges on

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.000 
I also started creating fake edges on
the<00:01:32.240> eyes<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.690> try<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.050> give<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> carved<00:01:33.710> look

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
the eyes to try and give a carved look

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:51.010 
the eyes to try and give a carved look
and<00:01:34.250> add<00:01:34.610> depth

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.450 

for<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> mouth<00:01:52.260> area<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.800> just<00:01:53.010> continued<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
for the mouth area I just continued the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
for the mouth area I just continued the
same<00:01:53.729> method<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.300> lining<00:01:54.540> leaving<00:01:55.170> some

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
same method about lining leaving some

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.140 
same method about lining leaving some
edges<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> carved<00:01:56.490> look<00:01:56.729> along<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
edges with that carved look along the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:31.640 
edges with that carved look along the
teeth

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.440 

for<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.890> woodgrain<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.640> really<00:02:34.210> just

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
for the woodgrain it's really just

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.120 
for the woodgrain it's really just
repeating<00:02:34.840> organic<00:02:35.260> lines<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:35.890> down<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
repeating organic lines up and down the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.910 
repeating organic lines up and down the
face<00:02:36.340> having<00:02:37.090> some<00:02:37.300> curl<00:02:37.660> towards<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.800> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
face having some curl towards and in and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.680 
face having some curl towards and in and
out<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.040> each<00:02:39.220> other<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.820> adding<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.360> random

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
out of each other and adding a random

00:02:40.690 --> 00:03:11.720 
out of each other and adding a random
wood<00:02:40.870> not<00:02:41.080> here<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.500> there

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.310 

for<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> neck<00:03:13.000> area<00:03:13.210> I<00:03:13.540> wanted<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.930> add<00:03:14.050> some

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
for the neck area I wanted to add some

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.320 
for the neck area I wanted to add some
intersecting<00:03:15.010> routes<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.670> tree<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.300> I

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
intersecting routes for the tree so I

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.240 
intersecting routes for the tree so I
decided<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.990> start<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.860> gray<00:03:18.040> for

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
decided to start with the gray for

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.040 
decided to start with the gray for
outlining<00:03:18.610> again<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.270> then<00:03:19.450> did<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.750> exact

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
outlining again and then did the exact

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.960 
outlining again and then did the exact
same<00:03:20.140> steps<00:03:20.500> as<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:21.010> face<00:03:21.190> along<00:03:21.610> all<00:03:21.820> the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
same steps as the face along all the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:52.170 
same steps as the face along all the
routes

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.559 

I<00:03:53.159> used<00:03:54.159> a<00:03:54.250> bit<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.430> black<00:03:54.670> eyeshadow<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:55.209> help

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
I used a bit of black eyeshadow to help

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.209 
I used a bit of black eyeshadow to help
bring<00:03:55.810> some<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.200> roots<00:03:56.349> forward<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.069> look

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
bring some of the roots forward and look

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.920 
bring some of the roots forward and look
like<00:03:57.340> they<00:03:57.489> sit<00:03:57.670> on<00:03:57.700> top<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:57.969> others<00:03:58.359> as<00:03:58.659> well

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
like they sit on top of others as well

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:09.370 
like they sit on top of others as well
as<00:03:59.049> add<00:03:59.170> some<00:03:59.349> contouring<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.920> the<00:03:59.950> face<00:04:00.189> area

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.990 

the<00:04:10.380> last<00:04:10.680> thing<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.950> did<00:04:11.100> was<00:04:11.280> add<00:04:11.460> some<00:04:11.700> small

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
the last thing I did was add some small

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.820 
the last thing I did was add some small
root<00:04:12.270> tendrils<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.140> ends<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.380> everything

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
root tendrils to the ends of everything

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.850 
root tendrils to the ends of everything
and<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.460> was<00:04:14.490> about<00:04:14.700> it
