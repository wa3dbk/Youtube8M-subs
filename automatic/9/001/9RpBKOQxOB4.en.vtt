00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
and then uh he created this serum which
eventually<00:01:45.240> led<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.110> everyone<00:01:46.649> being<00:01:46.829> Titans

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
eventually led to everyone being Titans

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.730 
eventually led to everyone being Titans
he<00:01:47.820> spread<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> throughout<00:01:49.229> everyone's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
he spread that throughout everyone's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.490 
he spread that throughout everyone's
water<00:01:50.040> supply<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> he<00:01:51.420> decided<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> use<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
water supply and he decided to use the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.090 
water supply and he decided to use the
Titans<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:54.500> cleansing<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.649> guess<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> could

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Titans as a cleansing I guess you could

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.819 
Titans as a cleansing I guess you could
say<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> humanity<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.329> destroy<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> kill<00:01:58.500> all

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
say of humanity to destroy and kill all

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.010 
say of humanity to destroy and kill all
of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> religious<00:02:00.090> people<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.689> why<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
of the religious people that's why the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
of the religious people that's why the
Titans<00:02:01.500> only<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.130> interest<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.610> humans

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
Titans only have interest in humans

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
Titans only have interest in humans
because<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> serum<00:02:04.170> whatever<00:02:04.680> he<00:02:04.860> did

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
because in the serum whatever he did

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.160 
because in the serum whatever he did
with<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.310> he<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.119> made<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
with it he like made it so that the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.770 
with it he like made it so that the
Titans<00:02:07.560> only<00:02:07.950> eat<00:02:08.190> humans<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.179> he<00:02:09.599> could

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
Titans only eat humans because he could

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960

we're more smarter Titans I guess you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.140 
we're more smarter Titans I guess you
could<00:02:52.739> say<00:02:52.830> could<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.040> created<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.790> he<00:02:53.910> gave

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
could say could be created and he gave
