00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 [Interleaved Cory Rich] 

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.363
 Hello, I'm Cory Rich, a photographer and an adventurer, 

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.915
 we find ourselves in beautiful Patagonia in Argentina. 

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.609
 Today we will be talking about taking pictures at intervals. 

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:18.208
 Capturing at intervals allows you to capture a long period of time 

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:21.750
 and hurry or compress it in a short amount of time. 

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.375
 For example, 4 hours in 4 seconds. 

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.538
 In fact, there are 3 ways to shoot at an interval: 

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:31.241
 the most obvious thing to do is capture a video 

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:33.875
 and then accelerate it during the subsequent processing. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.750
 The two techniques we will look at today are 

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.542
 Interval Capture and Interval Timer Shooting Mode. 

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.709
 When I was on the roof of the building in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:46.750
 looking over the city, and the sun set in the distance, 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.315
 I chose to use Interval Capture mode. 

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.792
 Good for this mode 

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:54.196
 is that it allows you to set your interval, 

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:57.010
 but when you're done shooting in space, 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.125
 it generates a movie in the camera; you get a QuickTime movie 

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.750
 directly from the camera. 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.583
 So you know right away whether or not it happened. 

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.375
 If you want to post it in social media or do it 

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:08.375
 open in editing program, 

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:09.750
 the movie is ready. 

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.029
 When you finish filming, 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:12.805
 you can instantly view the final video 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.250
 of the camera itself. 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.750
 It's really amazing! This is called an instant review. 

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.208
 The other extended option is for interval timer shooting 

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.041
 or the built-in interval 

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:24.000
 in your Nikon D7200. 

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.208
 When using interval timer shooting, 

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:30.367
 the nice thing about this feature is that after the capture 

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:34.417
 continue to access RAW or JPEG files, 

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.875
 which were captured during interleaving. 

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.092
 This gives you more opportunities 

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:42.108
 later to open and manipulate individual images 

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:45.667
 or the sequence in the final movie shot at a space. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.542
 One of the great benefits of the interval timer mode 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.086
 is that you have an opportunity right away 

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.091
 to cut the movie shot at an interval thereafter. 

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:57.250
 In fact, you shoot a movie file with a resolution of 6K. 

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.369
 So later you can open and immediately compress 

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:02.991
 or crop the image. 

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:08.669
 One of the most exciting features of the new Nikon D7200 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.553
 is the Capture mode interval, 

00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:13.333
 along with the mitigation of the exposure. 

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:15.427
 This allows people 

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:18.504
 like me and you, to shoot extreme changes in light. 

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:22.079
 Watch, for example, how the city goes from day to night 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.362
 without any vibrations in the final video file shot at a space. 

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.510
 If you are shooting at intervals for an extended period of time 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.961
 with radical changes of light, 

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:33.458
 there are a few things you need to do from the beginning. 

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.041
 1. On. Mitigation of exposure. 

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.608
 2. Automatic exposure mode, 

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:39.625
 Aperture priority. 

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.333
 3. Turn on Auto ISO. 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.056
 There are a few other settings, 

00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:45.630
 which you need to adjust in your camera, 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.166
 so that exposure mitigation can work effectively. 

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:52.291
 Exit Auto. white balance. 

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.384
 Set the white balance to 

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.112
 the environment in which you are shooting. 

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.917
 In Buenos Aires I shot in direct sunlight, 

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:02.006
 as well as here, in Patagonia, where we are again among Mother Nature, 

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:04.236
 so again the same setting. 

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.263
 Go to the menu to set the image controls 

00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:10.265
 and make sure none of the parameters are set to "automatic." 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.085
 Then turn off Active D-Lighting and Vignette Management. 

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:15.988
 The same settings are needed, 

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.697
 to avoid oscillation when shooting with a interval timer. 

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.542
 After capturing the Buenos Aires urban view, 

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:24.590
 I wanted more. 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.126
 We must always expand our creativity boundaries. 

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:31.291
 I went downstairs and called a taxi to take me to the hotel 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.125
 and I thought, "Would not it be cool to mount the camera 

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.083
 on the taxi as we pass quickly along the lights? " 

00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:40.569
 Just with a simple suction cup and camera strap 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.602
 I was able to mount the D7200 on the taxi 

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:46.080
 and really create a sense of movement, 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.755
 as we cross the city. 

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.291
 The idea here is to be creative, use your imagination 

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:55.250
 and find new places to shoot at intervals.
