position to share the tackle I'll run me
over<00:02:05.299> truck<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
over truck me what have you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.160 
over truck me what have you
not<00:02:07.620> going<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:07.860> happen<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.479> look<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:09.810> happens

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
not going to happen so look what happens

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.090 
not going to happen so look what happens
when<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.560> impact<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.160> met<00:02:12.200> my<00:02:13.200> god<00:02:13.440> goes<00:02:13.710> no

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.470 

the<00:02:17.100> nickelback<00:02:17.490> comes<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.030> physics

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the nickelback comes in and the physics

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.310 
the nickelback comes in and the physics
are<00:02:21.630> respected<00:02:22.430> look<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:23.580> happened<00:02:24.320> we

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
are respected look what happened we

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.800 
are respected look what happened we
stopped<00:02:25.620> him<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.890> his<00:02:26.010> tracks<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.820> because

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
stopped him in his tracks and because

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.080 
stopped him in his tracks and because
it's<00:02:27.990> two<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.350> us<00:02:28.730> obviously<00:02:29.730> we're<00:02:29.880> more

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it's two of us obviously we're more

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540 
it's two of us obviously we're more
powerful<00:02:30.630> than<00:02:30.750> him<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.340> strength<00:02:32.340> this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
powerful than him and strength this

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.310 
powerful than him and strength this
matter<00:02:32.790> strength<00:02:33.510> matters<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.110> scenario

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
matter strength matters in this scenario

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
matter strength matters in this scenario
and<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:36.000> lift<00:02:36.240> them<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.680> we<00:02:37.680> actually<00:02:37.860> take

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
and we lift them up and we actually take

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.890 
and we lift them up and we actually take
them<00:02:38.520> back<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.730> couple<00:02:39.000> yard<00:02:41.450> that's<00:02:42.450> what

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
them back a couple yard that's what

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.860 
them back a couple yard that's what
happens<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.710> real<00:02:43.920> football<00:02:47.300> yes<00:02:48.300> that's<00:02:48.690> what

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
happens in real football yes that's what

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.590 
happens in real football yes that's what
happens<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.350> can't<00:02:49.620> stress<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:49.950> more<00:02:50.130> than<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
happens I can't stress it more than that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.480 
happens I can't stress it more than that
let's<00:02:51.600> look<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.080> one<00:02:52.230> time<00:02:52.470> more<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.220> more

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
let's look at it one time more and more

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.630 
let's look at it one time more and more
of<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.670> natural<00:02:53.850> speed<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.780> can't<00:03:01.080> deny<00:03:01.380> that

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
of a natural speed you can't deny that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.730 
of a natural speed you can't deny that
all<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.940> guys<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.720> other<00:03:03.870> game<00:03:04.170> cannot

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
all you guys like the other game cannot

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.820 
all you guys like the other game cannot
deny<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.460> don't<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.850> that

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
deny that you don't see that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.860 
deny that you don't see that
backbreakers<00:03:07.830> giving<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> us<00:03:08.630> let<00:03:09.630> me<00:03:09.750> know

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
backbreakers giving it to us let me know
