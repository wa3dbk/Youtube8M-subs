of<00:04:40.250> times<00:04:40.460> no<00:04:40.760> it's<00:04:41.240> very<00:04:41.450> hard<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.690> take<00:04:41.810> a

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
of times no it's very hard to take a

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.050

two-dimensional character and make it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.090 
two-dimensional character and make it
three-dimensional<00:04:44.620> but<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.710> think<00:04:45.860> they<00:04:45.950> did<00:04:46.070> a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
three-dimensional but I think they did a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.660 
three-dimensional but I think they did a
pretty<00:04:46.160> good<00:04:46.460> job<00:04:46.520> on<00:04:46.850> him<00:04:48.400> one<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.550> only

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
pretty good job on him one of the only

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.980 
pretty good job on him one of the only
few<00:04:49.940> times<00:04:49.970> you'll<00:04:50.360> see<00:04:50.540> Charlie<00:04:50.840> Brown's

at<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.050> elbows<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.150> rotate<00:05:26.360> at<00:05:26.840> the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
at the elbows and you can rotate at the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.380 
at the elbows and you can rotate at the
waist<00:05:27.730> that's<00:05:28.730> really<00:05:29.000> all<00:05:29.090> you're<00:05:29.210> going<00:05:29.330> to

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
to hold the bag you would almost think

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.250 
to hold the bag you would almost think
that<00:06:17.180> you<00:06:17.270> could<00:06:17.390> bring<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:17.660> arms<00:06:17.870> forward

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
that you could bring the arms forward

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.590

and<00:06:18.530> that<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.520> bag<00:06:19.790> would<00:06:19.970> kind<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.270> just<00:06:20.420> sit

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
and that the bag would kind of just sit

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240 
and that the bag would kind of just sit
in<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.840> middle<00:06:21.110> but<00:06:21.230> as<00:06:21.350> you<00:06:21.410> can<00:06:21.500> see<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.980> just

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
in the middle but as you can see it just

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.960 
in the middle but as you can see it just
doesn't<00:06:23.060> really<00:06:23.120> do<00:06:23.420> it<00:06:24.520> there's<00:06:25.520> no<00:06:25.670> groove

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
doesn't really do it there's no groove
