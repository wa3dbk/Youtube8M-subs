00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.139
 there are girls, alright 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.150
 in today's video I'll show you 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 How do I do my nails at home? 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.730
 so if you want to see me well 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.519
 I trade in the nail polish I 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.289
 I was on my nails or if I was not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 using no glaze sometimes I leave 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 my nail to breathe a little I go 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 straight to the sandpaper I do not cut the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.800
 my nails because they are very 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.800
 short 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.760
 I like to sand my nails in 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.989
 square format for them not 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.989
 break so easily 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.630
 the second step is to take the cuticle I already 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.160
 I tried to stay without taking the cuticle but I 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.020
 I can not ram 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.510
 So I always use this 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.760
 granilla cuticles I love and besides 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.660
 to be scented it leaves the cuticle 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.660
 softer 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.940
 I like to leave a little sauce 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.270
 in the water can be cold or warm like you 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.270
 to prefer 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.080
 with a spatula I'm pushing 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.430
 gently cuticle to stay longer 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.430
 easy to remove 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 then just take a pair of pliers and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.530
 excesses I like to get enough yes 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.530
 the corners make it very clean even 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.430
 then I like to go back with the sandpaper and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.580
 take out those fountains that stand out 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.440
 this will help to fix the enamel more 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.980
 also so that it does not peel so 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.980
 fast 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.570
 today I'm going to wear this beautiful blue that is the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.800
 blue neon and I always like to apply 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.110
 two hands 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.160
 I never lose just one ever two so 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.160
 the enamel closes well 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.739
 is 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.880
 I apply on the whole hand and then I 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.430
 I come with the toothpick to remove the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.120
 excesses and makes it easier to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.120
 to clean after 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.879
 now with the same toothpick just use 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.140
 ketone and clean the nooks and crannies 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.140
 very easy girls 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.740
 I like to use a little oil 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.830
 secante is ready girls now 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.590
 just wait to dry it and you will soon see how 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.750
 It's easy, there's no secret, so this is it. 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.640
 I hope you have enjoyed a super 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.640
 kiss and even tea
