00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
eyeball is a nice touch

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.160 
eyeball is a nice touch
here's<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:29.000> other<00:04:29.210> side<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.810> head<00:04:29.990> we

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
here's this other side of the head we

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.480 
here's this other side of the head we
could<00:04:30.290> see<00:04:30.440> all<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.680> brains<00:04:31.010> getting<00:04:31.280> blown

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
could see all the brains getting blown

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.360 
could see all the brains getting blown
out<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:35.320> here's<00:04:36.320> another<00:04:36.410> closer<00:04:36.800> look<00:04:37.130> at

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
out and here's another closer look at

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.590 
out and here's another closer look at
Rick's<00:04:37.610> head<00:04:37.820> because<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.060> didn't<00:04:38.240> really<00:04:38.420> show

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
Rick's head because I didn't really show

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.690 
Rick's head because I didn't really show
that<00:04:38.810> before<00:04:39.130> but<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.160> do<00:04:40.250> think<00:04:40.400> they<00:04:40.520> did<00:04:40.640> a

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
that before but I do think they did a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.200 
that before but I do think they did a
good<00:04:40.850> job<00:04:41.350> sculpting<00:04:42.350> his<00:04:42.500> face<00:04:42.800> and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
good job sculpting his face and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
show you guys a closer look at the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.950 
show you guys a closer look at the
actual<00:05:35.270> base<00:05:36.940> what's<00:05:37.940> cool<00:05:38.240> is<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.780> base

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
actual base what's cool is the base

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.180 
actual base what's cool is the base
itself<00:05:39.410> rotates<00:05:40.220> 360<00:05:40.730> degrees<00:05:42.040> which<00:05:43.040> i<00:05:43.130> think

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
itself rotates 360 degrees which i think

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.580 
itself rotates 360 degrees which i think
is<00:05:43.370> a<00:05:43.400> really<00:05:43.610> nice<00:05:43.850> touch<00:05:44.230> but<00:05:45.230> you<00:05:45.320> can<00:05:45.440> see

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
is a really nice touch but you can see

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.570 
is a really nice touch but you can see
here<00:05:45.800> there's<00:05:46.070> like<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.280> walker<00:05:46.520> body<00:05:46.820> kind<00:05:47.660> of

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
here there's like a walker body kind of

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.390 
here there's like a walker body kind of
stuck<00:05:49.580> maybe<00:05:49.790> decomposing<00:05:50.510> on<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.720> ground

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
stuck maybe decomposing on the ground

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.530 
stuck maybe decomposing on the ground
with<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.430> little<00:05:52.610> walker<00:05:52.790> head<00:05:53.060> his<00:05:53.180> eyeball

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
eyeballs are all eating out so that's

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.560 
eyeballs are all eating out so that's
gross<00:06:10.220> but<00:06:10.580> I<00:06:10.640> like<00:06:10.790> his<00:06:10.910> mouth<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.330> like<00:06:11.480> the

shape of his head well it's cool about

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.050 
shape of his head well it's cool about
this<00:06:14.630> rotating<00:06:15.260> base<00:06:15.500> is<00:06:15.860> that<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:16.520> allows<00:06:16.820> you

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
this rotating base is that it allows you

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.990 
this rotating base is that it allows you
to<00:06:17.330> like<00:06:17.510> keep<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:17.990> front<00:06:18.260> plaque<00:06:19.000> wherever

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
to like keep the front plaque wherever

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.760 
to like keep the front plaque wherever
you<00:06:20.090> want<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:20.630> then<00:06:20.870> you<00:06:20.960> can<00:06:20.990> rotate<00:06:21.290> the

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
you want and then you can rotate the

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.800 
you want and then you can rotate the
base<00:06:21.979> so<00:06:22.640> whatever<00:06:22.850> angle<00:06:23.210> you<00:06:23.330> want<00:06:23.510> while

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
base so whatever angle you want while

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.840 
base so whatever angle you want while
still<00:06:23.840> maintaining<00:06:24.250> like<00:06:25.250> the<00:06:25.400> frontward

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
still maintaining like the frontward

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.340 
still maintaining like the frontward
display<00:06:26.300> of<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.540> plaque<00:06:26.750> instead<00:06:27.169> of<00:06:27.260> you

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
display of the plaque instead of you

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.170 
display of the plaque instead of you
know<00:06:27.500> turning<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:28.520> your<00:06:28.610> favorite<00:06:28.850> angle<00:06:29.090> this

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
know turning to your favorite angle this

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.240 
know turning to your favorite angle this
way<00:06:29.390> and<00:06:29.510> losing<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:29.919> so<00:06:30.919> I<00:06:30.950> think<00:06:31.040> it's<00:06:31.220> a

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
way and losing that so I think it's a

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.440 
way and losing that so I think it's a
really<00:06:31.550> really<00:06:31.669> nice<00:06:31.940> touch

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
really really nice touch

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.480 
really really nice touch
now<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.140> plaque<00:06:33.380> itself<00:06:33.710> is<00:06:33.919> sculpted<00:06:34.340> and<00:06:34.460> I

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
now the plaque itself is sculpted and I

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.800 
now the plaque itself is sculpted and I
do<00:06:34.550> like<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.120> fact<00:06:35.270> that<00:06:35.419> there's<00:06:35.630> some

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
do like the fact that there's some

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.420 
do like the fact that there's some
dimension<00:06:36.320> to<00:06:36.470> it<00:06:36.500> with<00:06:36.740> these<00:06:36.890> zombies<00:06:37.280> in

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
dimension to it with these zombies in

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.090 
dimension to it with these zombies in
the<00:06:37.520> forefront<00:06:38.030> and<00:06:38.150> these<00:06:38.930> walkers<00:06:39.530> behind

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
the forefront and these walkers behind

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.520 
the forefront and these walkers behind
the<00:06:40.190> chain-link<00:06:40.550> fence<00:06:40.760> in<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:41.000> background
