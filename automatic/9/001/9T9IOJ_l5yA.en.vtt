 Well, this is someone who will like and 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.060
 Begin to beat our cream 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.630
 so here is our smetanka became here 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.940
 such here 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 thick and lush cream now we 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.770
 send in the fridge for 15-20 minutes 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 Well, for the time being, we will cook ourselves 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 our cake to have it already 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.710
 smudge our cream the next step 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.040
 what we need to do we need to take 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.590
 our wafer cake layers and spread one 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.170
 the side 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.740
 with condensed milk you will need to smear somewhere 4 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740
 5 cake layers 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.030
 so after we smeared like 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.370
 our next yushchenko we need on 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.890
 each cake to evenly distribute our 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.440
 I will certainly have a cookie in it 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.200
 little helper 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.360
 can distribute cookies alternate lego 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.190
 checkered white brown 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.130
 made cakes but we will do it differently 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.500
 we will lay out on one piece of paper 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.459
 brown biscuits on another piece 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.459
 lay out pure white 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.090
 well here we are with my assistant finished 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.489
 work out our cookies for a bit and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:46.730
 I'll show you what to do now 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:47.620
 further after we sliced bananas 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.430
 and kiwi 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.700
 we proceed further to the final phase 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.079
 so first we take our cake with 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.360
 white and money and lay out here in 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:08.079
 such a chaotic order our kiwis on 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.079
 1 sheet 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:19.560
 and after kiwi we will spread our cream 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.700
 he has grown thick here a little 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.360
 in the fridge and so here we lay out 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.600
 right on the kiwi right on the cookie and be 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.600
 smear 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.389
 then when we smeared the first layer we 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.919
 take brown brown waffles with 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:05:01.360
 our cruiser and so we press 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.010
 her neatly beautiful but on 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.060
 brown waffle we will already 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.750
 spread bananas sliced just 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.750
 in a chaotic manner 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.800
 and again we cover everything with this cream 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:35.150
 well that's when we smeared our last 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.820
 the cake that was with cookies and banana we 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.280
 take a simple waffle cake already 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.560
 nothing smeared and just cover 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:49.220
 him on the last layer so on top and 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.080
 a little bit that's all you need since 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.080
 as if to press a little bit 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:03.700
 further the next step it will be already 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:09.160
 final we need to process our 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:12.730
 the edges need to be spread too with glue but 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.849
 so here so that the edges themselves are good 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.880
 soaked 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:22.490
 but it turns out that the cake 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.580
 inside will be saturated with no edges if 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:29.090
 we do not miss and now he needs to be given 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.490
 so that he soaked 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.310
 to our cookies our waffles 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.910
 soaked in all these creams 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:42.139
 with bananas and carry it is about the need 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.710
 3-4 hours to give him that he came to 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.960
 our readiness and then we will cut it 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.720
 and try what we did well 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.970
 that took about four hours and now 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.690
 we will cut into what see what 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:07:00.110
 how did we get it soaked 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:03.669
 the cake is cut gently the cookies are not 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:09.830
 felt to prevent the legs to cut 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:12.550

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:17.000
