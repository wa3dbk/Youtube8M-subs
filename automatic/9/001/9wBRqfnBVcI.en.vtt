00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
your or a five in one tool and start at

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.500 
your or a five in one tool and start at
the<00:01:17.659> top<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> lip<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:20.570> chisel<00:01:20.960> down

the top of the lip and just chisel down

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.730 
the top of the lip and just chisel down
cut<00:01:23.510> right<00:01:23.720> through<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.020> come<00:01:24.260> on<00:01:24.290> in<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.590> take

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
cut right through it come on in and take

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.609 
cut right through it come on in and take
a<00:01:24.770> look<00:01:25.010> so<00:01:26.000> there<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.330> go<00:01:26.540> if<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.080> repeat<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
a look so there you go if you repeat the

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.740 
a look so there you go if you repeat the
process<00:01:27.860> all<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.520> way<00:01:28.549> around<00:01:29.030> it'll<00:01:29.479> come

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
process all the way around it'll come

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.450 
process all the way around it'll come
off<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.500> snap

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.920 

so<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.270> snap<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.580> two

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
so now it's time to just snap it one two

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.360 
so now it's time to just snap it one two
three

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
three

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.040
