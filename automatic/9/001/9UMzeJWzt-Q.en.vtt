00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
hairstyle looks a lot better when your

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.759 
hairstyle looks a lot better when your
hair<00:04:14.569> has<00:04:14.599> kind<00:04:15.049> of<00:04:15.109> a<00:04:15.200> little<00:04:15.379> bit<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.530> volume

hair has kind of a little bit of volume

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.670 
hair has kind of a little bit of volume
rather<00:04:16.489> than<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:16.910> being<00:04:17.150> bone<00:04:17.570> straight<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.560> if

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
rather than it being bone straight so if

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.199 
rather than it being bone straight so if
I<00:04:18.799> were<00:04:18.949> you<00:04:18.979> before<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.579> did<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:19.759> style<00:04:20.000> I
