00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.100
 and there are two guys who swim like they are 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.779
 welcome again today 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
 it's fine we're back with a video 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.600
 of origins this time I will show you very 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.400
 quickly how to activate what the 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.600
 map song we know what happened to me 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.070
 previous or neither are we going to activate what 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.900
 that were three bears along the map 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.010
 and well basically this time it will be something 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.840
 very similar only that this time not 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.040
 we will be looking for the same site but 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.570
 this time we will be looking for what they are 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.340
 three pieces of a colored stone 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.780
 green so starting the game 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.700
 we know that we are reborn right at 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.930
 bottom of this hall later I 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.760
 we will arrive at what is the first 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.930
 generator and right here puts 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.340
 in front of what the generator is 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.109
 find what the first stone of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.760
 green color is very visible is 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.890
 right next to what would come to 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.420
 be the chest that gives you the first power 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.710
 So guys after that they 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.269
 I recommend that they go out so the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.489
 force that is just to the awad the 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.899
 ballista and later I will take us 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.420
 what the second generator would come 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.859
 there are a few things that tell you 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.089
 where to go because it's so simple 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.799
 There are a few indications 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.389
 which take you to what is the second 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.530
 generator and just being in the 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.089
 second generator I recommend them 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.979
 enough that they stay about two or three 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.239
 more rounds to put together a good 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.769
 number of points in this case 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.030
 we need a thousand points to open the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.620
 next door in which 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.329
 we will find what is the second 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.650
 Meteor stone or the second stone 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.780
 which will help us activate it 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.700
 the song so let's notice that in this 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.140
 part of the world what are 1900 points and 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.670
 later they can open the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.080
 next door after opening the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.460
 next door we have to enter the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440
 next room in which we will find 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.150
 the only stairs that are there inside 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.710
 we have to climb reaching them 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.850
 what is to the second floor and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.320
 right after giving some 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.180
 how many laps do we have that I do not take 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.380
 right hand we will come to what they are 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.120
 some shelves where we see that there 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.470
 enough stones but blue and 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.120
 we put just below these 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.620
 shelves we'll find a stone 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.970
 green color I think it's the only one of that 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.520
 color so there's no loses in what 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.930
 absolute just now hidden not 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.430
 it is only necessary to arrive at what the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.170
 third stone is what is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.550
 is the area of pac Poch to access 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.990
 what is this area we will need a 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.520
 good amount of points since for 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.020
 open the pay pons we will need to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.820
 around two thousand two hundred 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.960
 fifty whether it was the place in the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.520
 that you access what this area 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 just on the side where I 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.210
 I do on the opposite side there is no loss 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.010
 since still from these two 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.900
 tickets there is an extra in which 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.850
 we will find in a small descent of 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.560
 wood in which just bending to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.940
 the right we will find on the side of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.800
 what are the wooden boxes the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.360
 third of the last to activate what 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.040
 is the song on the map and see what is a 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.810
 very simple location guys there's no 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.160
 Loses the stones are very colored 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.020
 visible very striking 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.190
 they are very much in sight so guys 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.960
 so far I say goodbye with what is this 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.490
 source video only to show 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.080
 how to activate what the map song 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.310
 so guys, here I say goodbye 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.420
