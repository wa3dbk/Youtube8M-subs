00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
shutter speed whereas in other modes you

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.950 
shutter speed whereas in other modes you
can<00:01:20.060> manually<00:01:21.060> change<00:01:21.569> these<00:01:21.929> by<00:01:22.679> using<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
can manually change these by using this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.849 
can manually change these by using this
this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.109> a<00:01:25.200> slider<00:01:25.499> thing<00:01:25.829> right<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.039> and

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
this is a slider thing right here and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.849 
this is a slider thing right here and
it's<00:01:28.859> it's<00:01:29.609> it's<00:01:29.999> pretty<00:01:30.209> much<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.319> a<00:01:31.530> step

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
it's it's it's pretty much it's a step

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.300 
it's it's it's pretty much it's a step
up<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.459> these<00:01:32.700> beginner<00:01:33.359> miles<00:01:33.569> down<00:01:33.899> here

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
up from these beginner miles down here

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
up from these beginner miles down here
but<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.639> it's<00:01:36.209> in<00:01:36.509> between<00:01:36.899> these<00:01:37.170> two<00:01:37.499> so

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
but it's it's in between these two so

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.270 
but it's it's in between these two so
it's<00:01:37.950> automatically<00:01:38.990> detecting<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.469> range

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it's automatically detecting your range

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.769 
it's automatically detecting your range
of<00:01:41.399> field<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:43.079> next<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.009> manual<00:01:44.880> where

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:45.779 
of field the next one is manual where

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:48.679 
of field the next one is manual where
you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.920> adjust<00:01:47.279> with<00:01:47.969> this<00:01:48.149> little<00:01:48.420> slider

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you can adjust with this little slider

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.800 
you can adjust with this little slider
up<00:01:48.929> on<00:01:49.109> top<00:01:49.639> you<00:01:50.639> can<00:01:50.789> adjust<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.509> shutter

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
up on top you can adjust the shutter

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.769 
up on top you can adjust the shutter
speed<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.039> f-stop<00:01:53.639> and<00:01:54.029> this<00:01:54.600> is

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
speed and the f-stop and this is

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.019 
speed and the f-stop and this is
probably<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> most<00:01:55.259> advanced<00:01:55.920> feature<00:01:56.729> on

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
probably the most advanced feature on

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:01.179 
probably the most advanced feature on
this<00:01:57.209> camera<00:01:57.599> is<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:59.090> enabling<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.420> that

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
this camera is the enabling to do that

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.279 
this camera is the enabling to do that
and<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.450> professional

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
and you do the professional

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.109 
and you do the professional
photographers<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.249> intermediate<00:02:05.789> someone

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
photographers or intermediate someone

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
photographers or intermediate someone
who<00:02:06.209> knows<00:02:06.389> a<00:02:06.420> lot<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.719> cameras<00:02:07.319> would<00:02:07.439> use

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
who knows a lot about cameras would use

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.160 
who knows a lot about cameras would use
that<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:08.240> if<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> lighting

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
that and if you know like the lighting

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.360 
that and if you know like the lighting
conditions<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> stuff<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:12.300> next<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.370> av

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
conditions and stuff the next is av

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.240 
conditions and stuff the next is av
which<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.090> basically<00:02:15.660> changing<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.860> depth<00:02:17.069> of

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
which is basically changing the depth of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
which is basically changing the depth of
field<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.360> want<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.170> blurry

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
field if you want like a really blurry

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.199 
field if you want like a really blurry
background<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.330> focus<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.110> front

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
background or the focus is in the front

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.070 
background or the focus is in the front
basically<00:02:25.209> let<00:02:25.390> me<00:02:25.480> tell<00:02:25.689> you<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> little<00:02:25.930> about

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
basically let me tell you a little about

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.140 
basically let me tell you a little about
this<00:02:26.439> is<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.430> f-stop<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.430> higher<00:02:30.879> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
this is the f-stop the the higher the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.750 
this is the f-stop the the higher the
f-stop<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:32.290> more<00:02:32.560> that's<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:32.950> focus<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.640> your

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
f-stop the more that's in focus on your

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.390 
f-stop the more that's in focus on your
photo<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.720> higher<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.260> f-stop<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
photo and the higher the f-stop the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.460 
photo and the higher the f-stop the
slower<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.000> shutter<00:02:37.299> speed<00:02:37.659> let<00:02:38.170> me<00:02:38.230> say<00:02:38.439> that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
slower the shutter speed let me say that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.610 
slower the shutter speed let me say that
one<00:02:38.799> more<00:02:38.829> time<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:40.000> higher<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.299> f-stop<00:02:41.170> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
one more time the higher the f-stop the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.250 
one more time the higher the f-stop the
lower<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.190> slower<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.909> shutter<00:02:43.150> speed<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.140> if

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
lower the slower the shutter speed so if

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.160 
lower the slower the shutter speed so if
you<00:02:44.440> want<00:02:44.650> say<00:02:45.220> you're<00:02:45.430> shooting<00:02:46.170> your

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you want say you're shooting your

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.530 
you want say you're shooting your
shooting<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.799> house<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:49.030> not

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
shooting like a house and it's not

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.869 
shooting like a house and it's not
really<00:02:49.870> lit<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.409> there's<00:02:50.620> stuff<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:51.640> you

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
really lit and there's stuff that you

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.880 
really lit and there's stuff that you
want<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.209> focus<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> background<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.560> on

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
want to focus in the background and on

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.880 
want to focus in the background and on
the<00:02:53.950> foreground<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.239> daytime<00:02:55.890> you'd

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
the foreground in the daytime you'd

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.039 
the foreground in the daytime you'd
probably<00:02:57.280> want<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.940> use<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.180> high<00:02:58.569> f<00:02:58.750> stopped

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
probably want to use a high f stopped

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.390 
probably want to use a high f stopped
because<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.500> would<00:02:59.590> get<00:02:59.799> everything<00:03:00.280> in

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
because that would get everything in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.759 
because that would get everything in
focus<00:03:00.609> and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.170> shutter<00:03:02.409> speed<00:03:02.680> would

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
focus and then the shutter speed would

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.080 
focus and then the shutter speed would
be<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.950> little<00:03:03.129> slower<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:03.819> wouldn't

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
be a little slower but it wouldn't

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.430 
be a little slower but it wouldn't
matter<00:03:04.209> because<00:03:04.389> it'd<00:03:04.629> be<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:04.959> bright<00:03:05.200> out

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
matter because it'd be so bright out

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.670 
matter because it'd be so bright out
whereas<00:03:06.340> at<00:03:06.549> night<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:07.329> shot<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:07.959> probably

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
whereas at night the shot is probably

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.050 
whereas at night the shot is probably
going<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.859> look<00:03:09.010> blurry<00:03:09.310> unless<00:03:09.670> you're<00:03:09.879> using

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
going to look blurry unless you're using

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.610 
going to look blurry unless you're using
a<00:03:10.239> tripod<00:03:10.540> or<00:03:12.510> flashes<00:03:13.510> or<00:03:13.690> external<00:03:14.440> lights

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
a tripod or flashes or external lights

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.069 
a tripod or flashes or external lights
or<00:03:14.799> something<00:03:15.129> like<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:16.599> probably

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
or something like that so you probably

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.869 
or something like that so you probably
want<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.620> use<00:03:18.690> things<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.930> help<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.879> yeah

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
want to use things to help you and yeah

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.640 
want to use things to help you and yeah
that's<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.359> great<00:03:22.480> feature<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.930> I've<00:03:23.319> used<00:03:23.500> that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
that's a great feature to I've used that

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.369 
that's a great feature to I've used that
one<00:03:23.859> before<00:03:23.889> shooting<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.670> then<00:03:25.599> we'll<00:03:26.109> go<00:03:26.230> on

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
one before shooting and then we'll go on

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.229 
one before shooting and then we'll go on
to<00:03:26.409> TV<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.090> ever<00:03:28.209> been<00:03:28.590> say<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.949> a<00:03:30.430> pond

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
to TV have you ever been say at a pond

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.680 
to TV have you ever been say at a pond
or<00:03:31.829> maybe<00:03:32.829> like<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.069> waterfall<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:34.000> cameron<00:03:34.540> dee

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
or maybe like a waterfall to cameron dee

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.210 
or maybe like a waterfall to cameron dee
you<00:03:34.989> don't<00:03:35.169> know<00:03:35.290> how<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.500> do<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:36.010> either

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
you don't know how to do it it either

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.030 
you don't know how to do it it either
turns<00:03:36.669> out<00:03:36.879> like<00:03:37.060> blurry<00:03:37.449> or<00:03:37.780> it's<00:03:38.680> really

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
turns out like blurry or it's really

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.789 
turns out like blurry or it's really
crisp<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.790> depending<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.019> what<00:03:41.349> kind<00:03:41.709> of

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
crisp and depending on it what kind of

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.849 
crisp and depending on it what kind of
look<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.459> want<00:03:42.730> for<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.389> shot<00:03:43.829> say<00:03:44.829> a

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
look you want for the shot say a

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.770 
look you want for the shot say a
waterfall<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:46.919> around<00:03:47.940> two<00:03:48.940> o'clock<00:03:48.970> pretty

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
waterfall it's around two o'clock pretty

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.189 
waterfall it's around two o'clock pretty
good<00:03:49.930> shootin<00:03:50.230> time<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.510> either<00:03:52.660> want<00:03:53.019> it

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
good shootin time and you either want it

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.129 
good shootin time and you either want it
sharp<00:03:54.010> or<00:03:54.250> blurry<00:03:54.730> you're<00:03:55.599> probably<00:03:55.840> going<00:03:56.079> to

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
sharp or blurry you're probably going to

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.039 
sharp or blurry you're probably going to
go<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.530> TV<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.519> then<00:03:58.209> if<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.569> want<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:58.900> to

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
go to the TV and then if you want it to

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.170 
go to the TV and then if you want it to
look<00:03:59.199> like<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.919> just<00:04:00.129> like<00:04:00.220> BAM<00:04:00.549> just<00:04:01.060> like

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
look like really just like BAM just like

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.610 
look like really just like BAM just like
right<00:04:01.480> when<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:01.780> push<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.109> button<00:04:02.139> it<00:04:02.410> does

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
right when you push the button it does

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.150 
right when you push the button it does
just<00:04:03.480> just<00:04:04.480> right<00:04:04.840> then<00:04:05.109> then<00:04:05.829> you're<00:04:06.010> gonna

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
just just right then then you're gonna

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.460 
just just right then then you're gonna
want<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.519> shoot<00:04:06.790> at<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.419> very<00:04:07.720> high<00:04:07.870> shutter

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
want to shoot at a very high shutter

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.619 
want to shoot at a very high shutter
speed<00:04:09.299> probably<00:04:10.299> like<00:04:10.840> one<00:04:12.120> 1400<00:04:13.120> if<00:04:13.269> it's

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
speed probably like one 1400 if it's

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.210 
speed probably like one 1400 if it's
bright<00:04:13.900> enough<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.409> should<00:04:14.650> look<00:04:14.949> pretty

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
bright enough this should look pretty

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.949 
bright enough this should look pretty
good<00:04:15.669> or<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.859> shoot<00:04:17.889> in<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.789> slower<00:04:19.539> speed

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
good or you can shoot in a slower speed

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.750 
good or you can shoot in a slower speed
and<00:04:20.470> then<00:04:21.250> it'll<00:04:21.639> look<00:04:21.970> blurrier<00:04:22.659> but<00:04:23.380> if<00:04:23.760> you

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
and then it'll look blurrier but if you

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.480 
and then it'll look blurrier but if you
shoot<00:04:25.060> slower<00:04:25.659> it<00:04:26.139> allows<00:04:26.530> more<00:04:26.860> light<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:27.220> get

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
shoot slower it allows more light to get

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.510 
shoot slower it allows more light to get
in<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.940> one<00:04:28.570> more<00:04:28.750> light<00:04:29.020> gets<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.800> blares

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
in and one more light gets in it blares

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.370 
in and one more light gets in it blares
out<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.940> photos<00:04:31.330> if<00:04:31.539> you're<00:04:31.659> may<00:04:31.960> be<00:04:32.020> shooting

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
just it adjusts for the daylight that's

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.740 
just it adjusts for the daylight that's
coming<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.640> so<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.820> can't<00:04:45.150> shoot<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.510> slow

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
coming in and so you can't shoot it slow

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.620 
coming in and so you can't shoot it slow
and<00:04:45.930> I'll<00:04:46.140> look<00:04:46.260> really<00:04:46.650> nice<00:04:47.150> I'll<00:04:48.150> show<00:04:48.540> you

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
and I'll look really nice I'll show you

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.330 
and I'll look really nice I'll show you

doesn't<00:05:02.520> really<00:05:02.640> i<00:05:03.000> don't<00:05:03.420> i'm<00:05:03.930> not<00:05:03.990> really

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
doesn't really i don't i'm not really

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.890 
doesn't really i don't i'm not really
positive<00:05:05.160> about<00:05:05.250> this<00:05:05.520> mode<00:05:05.760> but<00:05:06.480> i'm<00:05:06.600> pretty

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
positive about this mode but i'm pretty

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.150 
positive about this mode but i'm pretty
sure<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.740> as<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:09.000> adjust<00:05:09.710> let<00:05:10.710> me<00:05:10.950> show

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
sure it just as you adjust let me show

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.460 
sure it just as you adjust let me show
you<00:05:11.190> there<00:05:11.460> can't<00:05:12.090> really<00:05:12.210> see<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.540> as<00:05:12.810> you

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
you there can't really see it as you

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.270 
you there can't really see it as you
adjust<00:05:14.240> let's<00:05:15.240> focus<00:05:15.630> as<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.770> adjust<00:05:16.890> the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
adjust let's focus as you adjust the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.070 
adjust let's focus as you adjust the
f-stop<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.920> shutter<00:05:19.920> speed<00:05:20.250> goes<00:05:20.490> with<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:21.080> so

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
f-stop the shutter speed goes with it so

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.410 
f-stop the shutter speed goes with it so
it's<00:05:22.260> like<00:05:22.710> in<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.070> middle<00:05:23.250> between<00:05:23.580> advanced

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
it's like in the middle between advanced

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
it's like in the middle between advanced
and<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:27.060> beginner<00:05:27.390> i<00:05:27.480> guess<00:05:27.750> i'm<00:05:28.140> not<00:05:28.200> really

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
and the beginner i guess i'm not really

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.590 
and the beginner i guess i'm not really
sure<00:05:28.560> about<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.070> that<00:05:29.340> just<00:05:29.580> what<00:05:30.270> i<00:05:30.300> mainly

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
sure about that that just what i mainly

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.940 
sure about that that just what i mainly
use<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:32.690> something<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.720> i<00:05:33.900> recommend<00:05:34.320> for

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
use and something that i recommend for

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.950 
use and something that i recommend for
most<00:05:35.280> these<00:05:35.520> modes<00:05:35.820> if<00:05:36.240> you're<00:05:36.660> going<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:36.840> be

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
most these modes if you're going to be

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.800 
most these modes if you're going to be
shooting<00:05:37.140> a<00:05:37.350> slow<00:05:37.650> shutter<00:05:37.680> speed<00:05:38.510> first<00:05:39.510> off

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
shooting a slow shutter speed first off

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.260 
shooting a slow shutter speed first off
i<00:05:40.110> don't<00:05:40.710> have<00:05:40.830> one<00:05:40.980> right<00:05:41.010> now<00:05:41.160> but<00:05:41.640> you<00:05:42.240> can

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
i don't have one right now but you can

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.200 
i don't have one right now but you can
get<00:05:42.600> an<00:05:42.870> external<00:05:43.350> flash<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.370> pops<00:05:44.730> right<00:05:45.030> on

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
get an external flash that pops right on

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.180 
get an external flash that pops right on
the<00:05:45.330> top<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.600> this<00:05:45.900> right<00:05:46.710> at<00:05:46.830> that<00:05:46.980> little

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
the top of this right at that little

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.130 
the top of this right at that little
shoe<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.330> then<00:05:49.100> it<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.580> flash<00:05:50.850> range<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.510> like

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
shoe and then it the flash range is like

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.840 
shoe and then it the flash range is like
I<00:05:52.410> think<00:05:52.590> it's<00:05:52.680> like<00:05:52.830> tripled<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:53.700> can

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
I think it's like tripled and you can

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.600 
I think it's like tripled and you can
shoot<00:05:54.060> three<00:05:54.540> times<00:05:54.780> as<00:05:54.960> far<00:05:55.250> another<00:05:56.250> thing

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
shoot three times as far another thing

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.860 
shoot three times as far another thing
is<00:05:57.110> possibly<00:05:58.110> getting<00:05:58.640> tripod<00:05:59.750> anything<00:06:00.750> will

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
is possibly getting tripod anything will

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.990 
is possibly getting tripod anything will
do<00:06:01.050> this<00:06:01.290> one's<00:06:01.470> not<00:06:01.650> very<00:06:01.890> expensive<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.730> it

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
do this one's not very expensive and it

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.880 
do this one's not very expensive and it
just<00:06:03.180> pops<00:06:03.510> right<00:06:03.660> on<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.050> top<00:06:04.290> of<00:06:04.320> there<00:06:04.650> I

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
just pops right on the top of there I

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.390 
just pops right on the top of there I
don't<00:06:05.460> have<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.700> mount<00:06:05.910> on<00:06:06.120> right<00:06:06.330> now<00:06:06.360> but

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
don't have the mount on right now but

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.640 
don't have the mount on right now but
down<00:06:08.400> here<00:06:08.910> it<00:06:09.450> pops<00:06:09.720> on<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:11.030> it<00:06:12.030> it's<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:13.500> can

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
down here it pops on and it it's you can

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.470 
down here it pops on and it it's you can
leave<00:06:13.860> it<00:06:13.890> what<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:14.520> can<00:06:14.670> do<00:06:14.820> since<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.330> don't

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
leave it what you can do since I don't

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.450 
leave it what you can do since I don't
have<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.600> remote<00:06:15.990> which<00:06:16.680> is<00:06:16.860> something<00:06:17.040> that

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
have a remote which is something that

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.000 
have a remote which is something that
clicks<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.600> camera<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:19.290> it<00:06:19.320> like<00:06:19.560> you<00:06:19.890> don't

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
clicks the camera so it like you don't

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.920 
clicks the camera so it like you don't
have<00:06:20.250> a<00:06:20.310> shutter<00:06:20.640> movement<00:06:21.120> when<00:06:21.600> you're<00:06:21.750> like

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
have a shutter movement when you're like

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.990 
have a shutter movement when you're like
pushing<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.010> camera<00:06:23.400> maybe<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:23.730> don't<00:06:23.940> know

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
pushing the camera maybe I don't know

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.300 
pushing the camera maybe I don't know
maybe<00:06:24.360> shakes<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:24.960> little<00:06:25.050> bit<00:06:25.320> so<00:06:25.980> you<00:06:26.070> have

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
maybe shakes a little bit so you have

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.070 
maybe shakes a little bit so you have
this<00:06:26.460> thing<00:06:26.700> that's<00:06:26.940> not<00:06:27.180> connected<00:06:27.780> you<00:06:27.930> just

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
this thing that's not connected you just

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.200 
this thing that's not connected you just
push<00:06:28.260> a<00:06:28.290> button<00:06:28.530> and<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:28.860> just<00:06:29.070> goes<00:06:29.310> but

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
push a button and that just goes but

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.200 
push a button and that just goes but
what<00:06:30.360> I<00:06:30.390> do<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:30.660> compensate<00:06:31.020> for<00:06:31.590> that<00:06:31.620> is<00:06:32.210> I

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
what I do to compensate for that is I

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.770 
what I do to compensate for that is I
shoot<00:06:34.220> with<00:06:35.220> a

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.910 

my<00:06:38.290> battery<00:06:38.620> packages<00:06:39.040> died<00:06:39.220> started<00:06:39.639> um

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
my battery packages died started um

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.280 
my battery packages died started um
shoot<00:06:41.920> with<00:06:42.130> a<00:06:42.160> self-timer<00:06:42.880> I<00:06:43.270> usually<00:06:43.840> shoot

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
shoot with a self-timer I usually shoot

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.340 
shoot with a self-timer I usually shoot
it<00:06:44.470> with<00:06:44.770> 10<00:06:45.220> seconds<00:06:45.820> it<00:06:46.630> takes<00:06:46.960> a<00:06:47.110> little<00:06:47.230> bit

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
it with 10 seconds it takes a little bit

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.379 
it with 10 seconds it takes a little bit
longer<00:06:47.560> than<00:06:48.040> if<00:06:48.160> you<00:06:48.280> had<00:06:48.310> a<00:06:48.460> remote<00:06:48.790> but<00:06:49.060> it's
