00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello guitarist welcome to the second 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.549
 podcast of the series how to learn to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.470
 play the guitar and not die in the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.240
 try before you start with this 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.860
 second podcast I wanted to thank the high 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 participation that this 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.240
 section in the podcast number one made 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.070
 a question at the end of the program in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.570
 which then I asked you what is your 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.400
 problem number one at the time of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.050
 learn to play the guitar for you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.820
 account and the truth is that there has been a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.099
 high participation a participation 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 incredible I did not expect it at all 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 both in comments and especially to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.219
 through email 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.739
 I have received a lot of answers and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.110
 I've been answering one by one and have me 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 surprised and a lot that 40 percent 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.550
 about all of these 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.190
 answers blamed this problem 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.500
 number 1 to the lack of time or to a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 poor organization of the time you are 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 dedicate when it comes to learning to play the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.860
 guitar so the theme of this second 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.649
 podcast will be focused on how 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 better organize time or how to get out 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 time from nowhere to devote to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 our instrument I want that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.359
 reflections with this question how 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.280
 you perceive your playing the guitar 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.150
 I ask this question because I liked it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 very much 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.440
 they left me in the video of podcast 1 in 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.500
 youtube in which he said more or less what 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.880
 next that many people focus 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.120
 in seeing the learning to play the guitar 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.520
 as something hard something difficult something that is 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.730
 long as an extremely career 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
 super tedious background that costs 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.360
 very much when in reality what 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 have to do is see it as a 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.460
 daily hobby and that little by little will go 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.170
 giving its fruits and joys and has all 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.700
 the reason you should not see the guitar as 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.800
 something complicated but you have to see it as 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 a hobby you have to see it as something 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.780
 fun and when establishing a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.630
 practice routine is different see it 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.790
 as something to study how to see it as a 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.320
 hobby that distracts you from day to day 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 so let's get to the point and I'm going to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.670
 give two tips to get that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.800
 time that you need first point 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.170
 change your perception of the term 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.610
 learn to play the guitar you do not have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.380
 to always be looking for new 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.300
 New tutorials new elections 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.009
 tabs you can also take your 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.570
 guitar and improvise to see what comes out 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.890
 try to have fun creating new ones 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.959
 melodies on the fly and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.370
 basically get to see the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.280
 guitar as a 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.530
 second search tool 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.599
 10 minutes a day to dedicate them to 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.959
 the guitar I'm convinced that at 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.299
 less 10 minutes of your day you dedicate them to 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.489
 television or you dedicate them to networks 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.040
 social so forget about these 10 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.549
 minutes on television and social networks and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.379
 invest that time in yourself invest 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.000
 in learning to play the guitar as you 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.739
 I said in point 1 you do not have to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.510
 you devote yourself to study in the pure 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.000
 meaning of the word but you can 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.459
 try and play with chords try new 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.530
 melodies and try to have fun at the same time 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.910
 what are you practicing as you see find 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.579
 time to learn to play the guitar 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.620
 it's not something complicated you just have to 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.230
 have a minimum of willpower 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.959
 that allow you to sacrifice pastimes 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.760
 harmful to invest in yourself and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.319
 in learning the guitar by 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.239
 other side you also have to start 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.040
 see studying guitar as something 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.620
 fun instead of as something purely 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.780
 theoretical a necessity 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.580
 nobody is examining you is to say you are 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.810
 learning to play on your own and what 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.209
 ideal is that you see it in a way 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.780
 fun is not going to have a person that 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.909
 evaluate and I put a suspense does not look 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.769
 what you the person that you mark the 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.640
 goals but always tries 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.709
 have fun try to create the habit of 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.709
 play the guitar every day to 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.599
 through the disconnect look for ways 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.159
 to evade you from day to day if you get 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.500
 that playing the guitar is your tool 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.660
 of disconnection you will get to touch the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.230
 guitar every day a question 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.519
 fast 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.829
 you can answer it both in the 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.359
 comments of the podcast 2 video on 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.609
 youtube as through email or to 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.530
 through the web and is the next which 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.599
 is your number one barrier that prevents you 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.090
 dedicate a daily time to play the 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.069
 guitar you know I answer everyone 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.659
 comments maybe took a little 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.640
 but in the end I respond to each and every 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.590
 one of them and nothing guitarist I hope 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.540
