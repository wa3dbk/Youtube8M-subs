00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.860 

what<00:05:49.720> do<00:05:49.810> you<00:05:49.870> mean<00:05:50.020> by<00:05:51.360> it<00:05:52.360> just<00:05:52.570> thought

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
what do you mean by it just thought

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.600 
what do you mean by it just thought
opiate<00:05:53.260> it's<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.590> style<00:05:53.860> yeah<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.370> then<00:05:54.460> it

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
opiate it's a style yeah and then it

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.950 
opiate it's a style yeah and then it
then<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.940> course<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.300> alcohol<00:05:55.540> level<00:05:55.660> seems

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
then of course the alcohol level seems

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.180 
then of course the alcohol level seems
to<00:05:56.050> creep<00:05:56.290> up<00:05:56.440> as<00:05:56.620> well<00:05:56.830> because<00:05:57.040> it's<00:05:57.130> a

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
to creep up as well because it's a

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.500 
to creep up as well because it's a
different<00:05:57.370> brewing<00:05:57.700> brewing<00:05:58.000> process<00:05:58.150> yeah

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
different brewing brewing process yeah

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.970 
different brewing brewing process yeah
so<00:06:01.510> I<00:06:01.540> think<00:06:01.630> this<00:06:01.780> is<00:06:01.840> what<00:06:02.020> this<00:06:02.140> one's<00:06:02.290> a<00:06:02.350> 7%

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
so I think this is what this one's a 7%

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.050 
so I think this is what this one's a 7%
alcohol<00:06:03.990> didn't<00:06:04.990> put<00:06:05.410> it<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:06.460> ingredient

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
alcohol didn't put it the ingredient

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.600 
alcohol didn't put it the ingredient
double<00:06:07.570> and<00:06:07.750> triple<00:06:08.080> or<00:06:08.320> is<00:06:08.950> it<00:06:09.100> like<00:06:09.340> you

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
double and triple or is it like you

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.270 
double and triple or is it like you
could<00:06:09.760> wanted<00:06:10.120> to<00:06:10.240> put<00:06:10.390> -<00:06:10.540> no<00:06:11.170> -<00:06:11.470> Southie<00:06:11.920> yeah

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
could wanted to put - no - Southie yeah

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.620
