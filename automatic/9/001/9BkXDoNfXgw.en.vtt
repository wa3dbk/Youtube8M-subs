this<00:00:05.790> one<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.540> way<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:06.990> can<00:00:07.109> play<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.379> with

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
this one is a way you can play it with

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.530 
this one is a way you can play it with
the<00:00:07.680> capo<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.309> 2nd<00:00:08.730> fret

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the capo on the 2nd fret

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.299 
the capo on the 2nd fret
I<00:00:09.570> think<00:00:09.960> Noel<00:00:10.170> did<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.469> fairly<00:00:10.740> recently<00:00:11.160> this

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
I think Noel did it fairly recently this

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.150 
I think Noel did it fairly recently this
way<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.910> his<00:00:12.179> London<00:00:12.780> acoustic<00:00:13.620> gigs<00:00:13.860> he<00:00:13.980> did

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
way in his London acoustic gigs he did

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.460 
way in his London acoustic gigs he did
fairly<00:00:14.370> recently<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:15.839> incidentally<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
fairly recently which incidentally I

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.050 
fairly recently which incidentally I
didn't<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> see<00:00:17.070> cuz<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.640> live<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
didn't get to see cuz I live on the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.920 
didn't get to see cuz I live on the
other<00:00:18.090> side<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.750> freedom<00:00:18.990> world<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.880> anyway

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
other side of freedom world but anyway

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.810 
other side of freedom world but anyway
pretty<00:00:21.930> simple<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.769> parts<00:00:23.130> inter<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.609> verse

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
pretty simple two parts inter on verse

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.849 
pretty simple two parts inter on verse
at<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> same<00:00:24.539> chord<00:00:24.930> sequence<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
at the same chord sequence and the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
at the same chord sequence and the
little<00:00:26.099> bridge<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.760> middle<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.330> four

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
little bridge in the middle with four

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.490 
little bridge in the middle with four
chords<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.340> all<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.519> need<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.320> goes

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
chords so all you need is so it goes

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:47.099 
chords so all you need is so it goes
like<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.859> basically

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.660 

right<00:00:48.129> sane<00:00:48.489> energy

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
right sane energy

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.260 
right sane energy
the<00:00:53.690> b72<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> sea

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.330 

instead<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.080> going<00:01:00.140> back<00:01:00.380> to<00:01:00.500> see<00:01:00.740> which<00:01:01.190> you

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
instead of going back to see which you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.180 
instead of going back to see which you
can<00:01:01.580> do<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:02.000> go<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.420> see<00:01:02.690> nine<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:03.920> cuz<00:01:04.040> it's

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
can do I go to see nine and it cuz it's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.470 
can do I go to see nine and it cuz it's
easier<00:01:04.280> they've<00:01:04.610> been<00:01:04.760> get<00:01:04.940> back<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.330> D

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
easier they've been get back to the D

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.040 
easier they've been get back to the D
again<00:01:05.600> I'm<00:01:06.170> lazy<00:01:06.500> but<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.850> Niles<00:01:08.630> pretty<00:01:08.900> lazy

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
again I'm lazy but and Niles pretty lazy

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.260 
again I'm lazy but and Niles pretty lazy
too<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.560> think<00:01:09.680> he'd<00:01:09.950> probably<00:01:10.100> do<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.640> CRI

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
too so I think he'd probably do a CRI

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.700 
too so I think he'd probably do a CRI
and<00:01:11.300> effective<00:01:11.960> C<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.640> D<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.470> next

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
and effective C to a D then the next

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.630 
and effective C to a D then the next
chord<00:01:15.980> I<00:01:16.280> think<00:01:16.760> is<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:16.940> c9<00:01:17.870> so<00:01:18.350> as<00:01:19.130> opposed<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.550> a

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
chord I think is a c9 so as opposed to a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.970 
chord I think is a c9 so as opposed to a
C<00:01:19.880> at<00:01:20.000> nine<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.300> c9<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.230> just<00:01:21.470> adding<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.860> that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
C at nine a c9 is just adding in that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.370 
C at nine a c9 is just adding in that
third<00:01:22.220> string<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.820> third<00:01:23.030> fret<00:01:23.230> so<00:01:24.230> it's

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
third string on the third fret so it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.070 
third string on the third fret so it's
an<00:01:24.560> open<00:01:25.190> third<00:01:25.870> second<00:01:26.870> third<00:01:27.530> third<00:01:28.570> open

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
an open third second third third open

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.990 
an open third second third third open
all<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.010> find<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.520> hide<00:01:32.730> you<00:01:32.880> can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
all right you find that to hide you can

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.830 
all right you find that to hide you can
play<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> c7

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.399 

I<00:01:36.880> think<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.939> c9<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.810> probably<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.290> correct

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
I think the c9 is probably the correct

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.719 
I think the c9 is probably the correct
cord<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.909> back<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.180> G<00:01:41.710> all<00:01:42.710> right<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.610> that's

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
cord and back to G all right so that's

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.779 
cord and back to G all right so that's
the<00:01:43.880> same<00:01:44.119> sequence<00:01:44.509> for<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.689> verse<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:48.789> come

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
the same sequence for the verse you come

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.500 
the same sequence for the verse you come
to<00:01:50.210> my<00:01:50.509> fatigue<00:01:51.880> you

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
to my fatigue you

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.760 
to my fatigue you
three

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.230 

and<00:02:01.220> same<00:02:01.430> again<00:02:01.549> for<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.820> second<00:02:02.090> verse

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
and same again for the second verse

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.059 
and same again for the second verse
obviously<00:02:03.490> alright<00:02:04.930> bridge-e<00:02:06.310> minor<00:02:10.540> minor

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
obviously alright bridge-e minor minor

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.190 
obviously alright bridge-e minor minor
look<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.880> probably<00:02:14.090> play<00:02:14.480> G<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.020> play

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
look you can probably play G but I play

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.259 
look you can probably play G but I play
g6<00:02:15.739> which<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.340> leaving<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.760> area<00:02:16.940> open

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
g6 which is just leaving the area open

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.589 
g6 which is just leaving the area open
for<00:02:17.510> getting<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.500> does<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.190> lock

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
for getting on does that lock

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.620 
for getting on does that lock
in<00:02:21.170> an<00:02:21.319> ace<00:02:21.469> us<00:02:21.769> too

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
in an ace us too

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.710 
in an ace us too
which<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.140> open<00:02:24.860> open<00:02:25.010> second<00:02:25.910> second<00:02:26.300> open

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
which is open open second second open

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.150 
which is open open second second open
and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.260> b7<00:02:29.890> again

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
and then b7 again

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:40.559 
and then b7 again
all<00:02:31.730> right<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.060> goes

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.050
