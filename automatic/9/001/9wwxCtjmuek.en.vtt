00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.200
 the geographical location of this place does not 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.200
 import 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.190
 it is a stretch of road in 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.190
 disuse of a kilometer in length 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.880
 it stopped being part of the old 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.880
 national 3 several years ago 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.860
 we do not know how many 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.820
 this dangerous closed curve was maybe 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.350
 the cause of the suppression of the stretch 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.190
 It is even possible that it belonged to the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 original layout of the current highway 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.580
 we do not know either 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.630
 and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.570
 however we have proposed to travel 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.160
 each and every one of the sections 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.730
 abandoned from the old route 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.730
 madrid-valencia 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.640
 that's why we're here in a cold and already 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.640
 twilight winter afternoon 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 It is overwhelming to walk on this road 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.880
 extinguished by which they came to travel 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.880
 millions of people 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.170
 we did it ourselves but now 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.460
 we are not able to remember 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.620
 concretely this place 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.430
 memory is more fragile than hard 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.430
 asphalt road 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.120
 there where the activity disappears 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.470
 human nature establishes its 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.470
 own indomitable laws 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.870
 white animals and stones take over 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.099
 of the ground 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.099
 and a lot 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.930
 and the abandoned road acquires a 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.930
 almost fossil and mineral appearance 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.099
 a few meters from here the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.090
 highway but this is a territory of 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.090
 loneliness and silence 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.390
 surely for many years that no 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.170
 vehicle or human being they stepped on 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.170
 this asphalt 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.610
 the night will soon fall and with it a 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.610
 mantle of ice on this place 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.769
 it's time to return to the 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.769
 civilization
