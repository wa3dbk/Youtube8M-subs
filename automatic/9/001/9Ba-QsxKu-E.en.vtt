00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.260
 I will explain the 9th government's violence 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.560
 Rice No. 56 is basically a maker of Karakuri 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.149
 I am 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:16.119
 The power supply has been for two years with a $ 100 MC100 tax and a two-year return 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.369
 Vacuum pump 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.159
 At a depth of 20 volts 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.019
 The power supply party of the power supply is an exchange with the poor 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.420
 Get off with allocation 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.060
 This electrode 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.250
 I will exchange cooking after the array of the main and then 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.019
 The protrusions that stick to the wall 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.940
 @press at press is made up of 14 macros in total 

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:41.550
 but 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.060
 The government is 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.050
 When it came to the wall after revising to the wall 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.080
 By facts and facts gathered in the permanent wooden hall 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.000
 The whole body is s simultaneously advancing 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.510
 Stuck in the wall 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.430
 And 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700
 Always four to five 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.660
 Up to 200 with eco watt knife and crawler 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.400
 It is with the power of kilometer 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.330
 Then I kept the etching and putt from the wall 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.620
 Because it is a prewar battle 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.670
 I do not want to add a big vacuum for coming off 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.590
 After all the new party meeting 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 The difference between the counter rotation and the true exchange with the electrode throw 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.340
 Put off the sugar now put-based 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 At that time with mechanical valve 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.920
 Identical to the broadband 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 There was an answer with Ashin 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.830
 Thereby 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.290
 Get off the wall and open again 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.180
 Run around the mean with the infinite track method 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.730
 Professional baseball commentator 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.430
 The ninth professor 56 is basically nine wears in a total of four of the factory wall danger work 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.740
 I will direct the manufacturing equipment here to the customer about this as it is an eye-foot component 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.100
 Or with a gondola for single use 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.180
 Or I want to put on a machine 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.189
 Such an application 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.040
 Only by doing so is the school building on the wall of the negotiations 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.969
 It is a part that can work in dangerous work 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.389
 Yes we do not like that application 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.829
 Customer 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.309
 While developing the degree of influence together 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.579
 It was said that the test drive was reflected 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.819
 But I have a goal
