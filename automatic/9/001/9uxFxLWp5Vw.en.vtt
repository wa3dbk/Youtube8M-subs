00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 what's up the pgm this super studs at 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.400
 micro and I hope you're fine 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.900
 me today I'm farting the form I 'm going 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.059
 really great and we end up 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.429
 today for the new episode the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.170
 second episode of my road to series 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.930
 gareth bale so as you see i have 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.230
 sold all my players so off will not have 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.670
 so due maxwell et cetera and so on and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.029
 leaving him on a new 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.710
 technique anyway because here are the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 black players that's good it's great 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.489
 but I'm only 302 bnf 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 so I really wanted to change so 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.829
 you will see that I will leave on 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.379
 a dabo so it's a money player so 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 I will buy at 1000 maximum credit 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 so there were four pages of dabo and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 so you'll see that I'm going all 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
 buy and I'm going to put everything on 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.270
 the list of transfers no and I I 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.719
 go buy 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 well I think thirty two dabo and who will 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 stay me vinyl credit because I 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.690
 have only the stack a trans I would have had the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 bigger pile so or 50 down I would have 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.530
 could buy all the dabo but hey it's 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 not important 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 so today we finally find ourselves 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.100
 for this second episode a legate so 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 frankly it's okay not bad so seen 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.470
 that I can do that the videos the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.760
 week it was already three days that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.950
 I had sold all my players 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.350
 but then I had to wait for a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.320
 unfortunately otherwise I would already be 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 surely at episode 3 so first dabo 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 why I took dabo simply 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.750
 because here is already a money card 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.640
 who plays in liga who is french so 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 it's players rather how to say 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.460
 was looking for lyon that's a big 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.259
 club 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.079
 so even so hot for the psg 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's a big a big club of France 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 simply first the lion ex 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.159
 witness and french ben here he is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.570
 French 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.920
 for cases the teeth you are small 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 hybrid in small teams of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.380
 la France 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.240
 it could really be a lot of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.040
 all the guys so that's why I 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.450
 taken first why I also have 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.890
 taken because it really has very good 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.180
 stats so it's a left defender 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.259
 with 75 or 74 speed 74 defense 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.440
 and 74.2 of defense machine bath is 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.640
 also physical 74.2 that's physical and 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.100
 that's why I'm priced because 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.470
 according to me those of abobo he can really 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.200
 from there are really ways that go 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.610
 and who even leave very easily 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.150
 that way earlier I stopped 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.010
 to buy them first me 2000 ha 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.689
 an hour ago and not finally there are 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.370
 fifty minutes and well everything 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.599
 just guys I asked my 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.069
 pal to go redeem having less 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.989
 of 1000 having stayed ten and ben 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.959
 there was more then supported to drink 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.299
 minus 2000 so that means everything 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.000
 just that ben my little dabo ben 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.680
 here you see normally he goes so 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.299
 I hope in any case that he will leave 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.000
 normally there will be no worries seen 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.109
 that it's a good league nation 1 so 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.799
 this is what I advise you for 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.599
 monopolies 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.220
 because seen that right now he is going out 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.290
 a lot of support hours we can more 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.359
 really do techint view etc 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.209
 that it breaks the balls good ben me I 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.489
 redirects me to tec baky who commits 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.639
 shooting that may be worth such bah 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.799
 the style of tec with monopolies 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.129
 on money genres of bronze players 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.859
 also and ben and black gold players 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.389
 so that's so it'll be the end soon 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.700
 of this episode you will see that I have 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.989
 listed all but first a four thousand 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.010
 hundred thousand and 500 and since I have that 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.510
 I bought 500 credits 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.700
 it's going to make me some money 2002 mills 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.319
 1959 not feel in my opinion there really is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.720
 average of 6 years all to really do 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.250
 something beautiful so you go 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.680
 see right away that it's the end of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.140
 this episode so normally in one or 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.960
 two seconds 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.480
 there will be the miniature so here is 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.980
 wait a second so here is j 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.740
 would have sold so I started with 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.300
 9872 credit finished with thirty thousand 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.819

 makes a total of 40 1432 which is 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.690
