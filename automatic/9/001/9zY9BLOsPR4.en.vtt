00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 Well Jan om d em 5 Well there usually po ne to the single focus of the Olympus 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.710
 It is fun to take a video with a lens . 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.020
 Why it is so easy to shoot standing there with a grip in vertical grip 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:25.630
 I also mainly two-fold act somehow a good idea to are operating in a video this is taken not moving people vertical 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.700
 I have a reason not have to buy it that external grip I mean freshly painted yellowtail 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:36.220
 There is a reason Why do you see it yes 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:40.330
 Yes this is the camera body om d em 5 mark 2 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:45.310
 8 Oh but with a lumix men's cap 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.570
 The lens is also an Olympus lens , but why are you using a lomix guy? 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.200
 This I say 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.720
 But I was removed and water cap, even a lens with hood 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 so 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.960
 Is this hld 8? 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:05.270
 This is a vertical blip and this is an ordinary grip 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.840
 Almost no grip or lack of excitement 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 It is easy to use even in front of me 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.470
 Using without non-convenience at all 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 Some people that I want a little more grip in the middle Well Kedomo had 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:27.479
 I like in it because you do not have an feel of the sound good feeling here Hey suede 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 When I light it up, I guess it won't get scratched, though 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.100
 Here I of the back side of the main body 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.650
 I will 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.800
 I will talk with Perot 2 this soft place 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.440
 I'm told I lost it 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.300
 This is a ridiculous part but hey 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:51.280
 Actually I noticed after shooting the video of the main part, but this cover is also 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:55.690
 It is in the hollow here here after removing 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.159
 You can attach it and the other cover is here too 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.900
 It had become as definitive in kit attached to the person of here 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:10.740
 I just wonder if it's easy to fall 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:13.950
 I hope a little more firmly hooked Nde I think the kana not it easy to fall 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.690
 I think this is a tripod hole in the tripod 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.380
 here 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.620
 I 'm going to put a lock I'm going to lock 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.850
 So I'm going to pull electromagnetics 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.330
 It will fit if I turn it black pull pull 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.530
 Lecturer lot position of hole of tripod 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.710
 There are 12 along the way, it is easy to hold 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 Certainly 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:43.990
 Is not Sugin a little or a ne if I do say is easily cut say in my hand Do not anymore 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.300
 A little 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:52.080
 Ledge But I'm feeling that I wonder if I even a little without 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.250
 I have a fesh shutter button 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.390
 So it's a thing so far Tteyuu shutter button What happens of 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.100
 Either can be used Either can also be used 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.610
 so 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.760
 It is here that I want you to see for a moment 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.200
 By the way of body 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.980
 What do you think this is? 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.500
 It is written here this microphone, but 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.330
 There is a microphone turn person There is hdmi usb 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.910
 Something is missing 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.920
 If there is a microphone terminal, you have to listen to the microphone monitor and you have to hear the microphone 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.900
 So what kind of sound is it 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.980
 Why is that so? 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.550
 It is here 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.550
 Headphones at the grip I just installed 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:47.660
 The person who wants the headphone headphone terminal at the place where the sasha is divided now is this 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.660
 Useless have to buy a grip 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 Deaf users and external grip dial function 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.500
 This is exactly what this external grip dial function 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.940
 Dimension 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.430
 Or to the headphone volume headphone volume 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.060
 The only which way whether the same function here 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:16.650
 Neda from Well exposed Jose 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.150
 I usually assign exposure compensation , but here too exposure compensation or headphones 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.139
 I wonder if it's a volume 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.430
 I inadvertently Now when you shoot 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:32.050
 Not it would be messing this inadvertently Pollet headphone volume by mistake and exposure compensation 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:38.480
 Another dolly before it is microphone on whether the accessory shoe on the kitten child in the Well but I videos 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:42.890
 And if you want to use it, now you have to monitor it here 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.980
 It will be Tteyuu Let Hey external grip times 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.240
 so 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.249
 Vertical grip 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.239
 Here Yeah it Is 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:58.579
 If it is changing now , 2 will open here 

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:59.409
 The battery can hold a spare battery 

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:02.409
 so 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:07.239
 Here is bc 9 bolt 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.510
 I will be able to spread the power from the outlet, but the same cover is attached again 

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:11.820
 Remove this 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.270
 Same as this 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.800
 Fit 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.590
 It can be installed by turning it round and round 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.440
 Take a look 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:30.100
 It pretty easy to shield possession is 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:34.540
 It will be easy to hold value when shooting in vertical composition shooting in vertical composition 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:38.080
 Function button you have two with it we are nibbling function button 2 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:42.040
 Function body 1 and 2 are assigned 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.430
 Well it is somewhere and say when the function button position this 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.030
 1 and 2 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.260
 Ray 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.330
 The same thing is assigned here 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.350
 Here 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.950
 It is the back side dial It is this 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:02.200
 And also it comes with the front side of the dial 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:07.390
 Yes here is the shutter release button 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:13.500
 You can not record the suffering lock suffering lock it rests lock 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:18.240
 When I have to do this in you there for after all I size painter or other camera 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.990
 Having here why would hit doing this it's would hit the palm gold dial 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.930
 Ne 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:30.729
 Nde serving idea who the diamond will be helluva If you do not lock 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.620
 A little feeling tried earlier will end up in helluva malfunction 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.550
 Yes 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:42.780
 Good lock over towards door panel and the other absolute I usually in So 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:43.740
 It may be a bit irritating that if you are taking pictures vertically, you may lose the lock 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.710
 Not 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.520
 It might be frustrating again if you forgot 6 when you turned back again 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.590
 Oh 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.510
 It was crazy 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.840
 By the way there is also a tripod here, but this one is largely out of the way construction work 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:05.120
 I will 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.500
 Is ginger a say because they are Well here battery ends shifted from heavy soot optical axis 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:13.180
 I guess I can not help but 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:14.940
 Hey Kedomo you can put the strap in the vertical retention It is strap a here 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.890
 a 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.960
 Take this photo because highly unlikely Well the Tteyuu to take videos Well hand was in the first place 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.409
 Kedomo will be only when 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:29.689
 If not, I think weight 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:33.379
 Weight is a factor that has a considerable effect on camera shake, though 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:39.319
 The balance of weight is not bad 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:40.129
 Rather, it will be better in terms of weight, so if you can put it on, you can run the battery for a long time 

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:44.400
 Because I do 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:48.000
 Because when you take a video, you have 2 batteries. 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.690
 It is a feeling that it is not bad either 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.180
 I think that you are jealous because it is a fairly expensive product 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:57.930
 If you want a headphone monitor 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:02.160
 I can only buy this Yes 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.830
 There is only this place There is only the face of the valley of the wind 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.240
 Yes 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.240
 It was a product that
