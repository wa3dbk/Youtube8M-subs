00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.650
 the word needling comes from English 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.810
 miguel which means needle 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.369
 in fact it is precisely on the needles that it is based 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.619
 this treatment which is a true e 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.750
 own physical mechanical treatment of 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.520
 b remodeling that stimulates the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.500
 production of new collagen ed 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.630
 elastin in the skins that have it 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160
 need directions to this 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.340
 treatment include the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.530
 rejuvenation in chrono photo skins 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.510
 aged but also scars from 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.850
 acne even white stretch marks 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.460
 collagen and elastin are normally 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.650
 present in young and tonic skin e 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.150
 healthy as they fail throughout 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.210
 that series of physiological conditions 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.430
 and pathological I just described 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.860
 the treatment involves the use of a 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.140
 roller on which they are applied in rows 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.830
 parallel numerous steel needles 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.619
 surgical 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:10.040
 their diameter is 0.25 mm while the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.530
 length varies from 0 5 to 2 mm depending on 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.720
 of the indication 05 we will use it for 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.640
 rejuvenation 11 and a half for the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.299
 acne scars 2 mm for the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 stretch marks 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.159
 what we see here is a roller 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.329
 exactly as used in the 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.060
 clinical practice is passed several times 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.960
 on the patient's skin 5 times in 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.819
 all vertical horizontal directions 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.579
 diagonal until you get a 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.429
 redness a slight bulge 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.469
 of the skin and point bleeding 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.079
 which must be uniform throughout the area 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.179
 treated clearly what makes 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.939
 tolerable this annoyance 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.659
 application about an hour before a 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.289
 local anesthetic 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.210
 in disinfection the subsequent disinfection 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.759
 removal of the anesthetic is clearly 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 what guarantees us to act in 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.299
 maximum sterility and maximum 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.549
 cleaning for the patient 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.649
 security is maximum in the sense that 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.509
 over the next day the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.890
 patient is perfectly capable of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.049
 return to all his practices 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.780
 daily and work if she is a lady 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.489
 put on makeup without having details 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.099
 consequences within six eight 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.690
 weeks we begin to observe the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.299
 results that are particularly 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.030
 effective in those very difficult wrinkles 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.120
 to treat as periorals for dips 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.980
 although it is better to do 3 4 treatments 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.450
 over a cold season for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.910
 have the best result 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.200
 where milling is contraindicated is 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.940
 contraindicated in pregnancy 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.769
 breastfeeding in people 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.200
 especially subject to formations of 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.599
 frames of and in people who have one 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.430
 inflammatory pathology such as acne in 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.709
 active phase 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.920
 the needling was also effectively 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.870
 combined with photodynamic therapy 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.000
 that is after the execution of questions 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.340
 bling masks are applied 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.209
 with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C afterwards 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.989
 a few minutes a therapy is applied 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.209
 photosensitizing a cream photo 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.549
 lower acid 5 sensitizers 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.370
 bulimic for an hour and a half an hour 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.590
 depending on the indications later for 15 20 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.209
 minutes is applied to the red light 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.269
 of acting photodynamic therapy 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.590
 on the superficial dermis the consequences from 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.510
 a point of view we say of the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.430
 convalescence of the patient are 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.470
 slightly more challenging than 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.500
 simple nibili instead is an edema and a 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.750
 blushes that last 24 to 48 hours more but i 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.579
 results are extremely effective 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.200
 we talk about two sessions for the 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.910
 facelift and four 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.220
 more sessions for acne scars 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.120
 serious with results that are maintained 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.120
 even a year away
