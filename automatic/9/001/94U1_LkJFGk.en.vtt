College of Music and right around that
time<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.410> sort<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.630> getting<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.750> little<00:03:23.840> bit<00:03:23.960> out

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
time I sort of getting a little bit out

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.720 
time I sort of getting a little bit out
of<00:03:24.260> metal<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.740> wasn't<00:03:24.980> sure<00:03:25.190> what<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.490> wanted

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
of metal and I wasn't sure what I wanted

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.300 
of metal and I wasn't sure what I wanted
to<00:03:25.970> do<00:03:26.090> musically<00:03:26.740> and<00:03:27.740> I<00:03:27.860> started<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.220> move

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
to do musically and I started to move

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.730 
to do musically and I started to move
away<00:03:28.430> from<00:03:28.520> guitar<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> bit<00:03:29.210> and<00:03:29.390> explore<00:03:29.750> music

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
away from guitar a bit and explore music

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.920 
away from guitar a bit and explore music
synthesis<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.760> technology<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.570> those<00:03:32.660> kinds

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
synthesis and technology and those kinds

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.040 
synthesis and technology and those kinds
of<00:03:32.990> things<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:35.150> sort<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.510> led<00:03:35.720> me<00:03:35.750> to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
of things and and that sort of led me to

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.470 
of things and and that sort of led me to
to<00:03:36.530> composition<00:03:37.070> eventually<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> made<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.300> to

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
to composition eventually I made it to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.830 
to composition eventually I made it to
Cal<00:03:39.350> arts<00:03:39.760> for<00:03:40.760> my<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.150> my<00:03:41.240> master's<00:03:41.570> degree

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
Cal arts for my for my master's degree

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600 
Cal arts for my for my master's degree

and I've kind of went the other
direction<00:03:52.130> where<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.580> like<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.880> studied<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
direction where I like I studied the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.650 
direction where I like I studied the
more<00:03:55.040> non-traditional<00:03:55.570> esoteric<00:03:56.570> stuff

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660

into traditional instrumentation but

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.430 
into traditional instrumentation but
with<00:04:02.900> this<00:04:03.050> sort<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.640> um<00:04:04.960> strength<00:04:05.960> I'm<00:04:06.200> sort

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
with this sort of um strength I'm sort

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.480 
with this sort of um strength I'm sort
of<00:04:06.470> informed<00:04:06.920> by<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.640> non-traditional<00:04:08.630> and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
of informed by the non-traditional and

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.580 
of informed by the non-traditional and
it<00:04:10.490> makes<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.880> kind<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.510> kind<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.260> fun<00:04:12.410> for<00:04:12.530> me

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
it makes it kind of kind of fun for me

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.130 
it makes it kind of kind of fun for me
to<00:04:12.710> figure<00:04:12.860> out<00:04:12.980> ways<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.550> try<00:04:14.330> to<00:04:14.360> kind<00:04:15.020> of

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
to figure out ways to try to kind of

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.720 
to figure out ways to try to kind of
imitate<00:04:15.620> these<00:04:15.950> things<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.370> do<00:04:16.489> with

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
imitate these things that I do with

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.770 
imitate these things that I do with
computers<00:04:17.150> but<00:04:17.330> with<00:04:17.510> non-traditional

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
computers but with non-traditional

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.620 
computers but with non-traditional
instruments
