00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.430
 in this recipe I want to teach you 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.780
 prepare the stew that is one of the 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.300
 dishes that are traditionally consumed 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.880
 Friday of Lent our country 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.759
 because of the religious prohibition of not 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.919
 eat meat during this time and we go 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.840
 to start throwing our pot at 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.420
 chickpeas that we will have put them 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.670
 soak the night before we take a 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.670
 potato or a bay leaf and we're going to 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.280
 cover the chickpeas with water 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.260
 and we 're going to take it to the fire and when 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.660
 begins to boil we put the cover 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.820
 to the pot and from the moment you have 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.260
 raised the valve you leave the time 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.950
 necessary until you have the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.950
 cooked chickpeas 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.540
 and while we are going to chop the onion in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.300
 small squares 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.160
 and the garlic is very finite itches alone 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.160
 you spoke with a garlic thinker 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.880
 put a pot on the fire and throw a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.160
 good spray of olive oil and add 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.620
 the onion and the garlic that we had chopped 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.830
 and fry it until it has a color 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.440
 golden pour a teaspoon of paprika 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.200
 and lower the fire so it does not burn 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.140
 and immediately drop the 200 grams of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.060
 spinach that can be fresh or 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.399
 frozen 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.250
 and let them go cooking 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.409
 simmer and when they have finished the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.570
 chickpeas open the pot and throw 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.000
 Blender bowl on the potato 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.670
 a handful of chickpeas and broth 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 and we crush it well until we have left 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.500
 a kind of very fine cream 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.850
 and as soon as you have it back again to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.340
 toss it into the pot with the chickpeas and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.560
 remove it well if you got the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
 Sparkling above do not worry is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.650
 normal if you want you can take it off 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.260
 little with the bucket above 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.120
 and you will have it ready to dump them 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.980
 over the pot where we had the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.800
 spinach that we will have them too 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.650
 well sautÃ©ed 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.000
 Mix it well and let it boil all 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.000
 together for half an hour 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.190
 After this time we can take the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.650
 cod we've also put in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.200
 salt the day before 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.360
 we let it boil about 10 minutes and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.549
 we tested the point of salt and if it were 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.680
 necessary this is the time to lie down 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.049
 but until then we have not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.150
 put because the cod being in 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.150
 salting tends to save them the plate 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.500
 and to finish just I have left 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.200
 cut eggs in quarters and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.490
 place them above the stew that already 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.830
 we will have it ready to take to the table 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.080
 I encourage you to prepare this dish 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.390
 because it's great and even if it's 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.480
 special of the Lenten season what 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.700
 we can eat throughout the year and if 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.100
