this<00:03:12.830> was<00:03:13.040> around<00:03:13.310> 2005<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:14.840> yeah<00:03:15.020> put<00:03:15.470> a

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
this was around 2005 so yeah put a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.610 
this was around 2005 so yeah put a
little<00:03:15.560> rebellious<00:03:16.310> once<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:18.110> soon<00:03:18.170> as<00:03:18.470> it's

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
little rebellious once as soon as it's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.410 
little rebellious once as soon as it's
an<00:03:18.740> early<00:03:18.920> China<00:03:19.340> sort<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.940> thought<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.210> would

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
an early China sort I thought I would

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.560 
an early China sort I thought I would
compare<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.810> with<00:03:20.900> its<00:03:21.170> buddies<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.910> song<00:03:23.150> LAN

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
compare it with its buddies the song LAN

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.810 
compare it with its buddies the song LAN
LAN<00:03:23.870> which<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.320> have<00:03:24.440> previously<00:03:24.710> reviewed<00:03:25.490> as

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
LAN which I have previously reviewed as

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230 
LAN which I have previously reviewed as
well<00:03:26.600> as<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:27.530> contemporary<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.670> Tyrannis

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
well as the contemporary you Tyrannis

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.290 
well as the contemporary you Tyrannis
which<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.720> actually<00:03:29.960> lived<00:03:30.320> alongside<00:03:31.090> now<00:03:32.090> of

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
which it actually lived alongside now of

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.000 
which it actually lived alongside now of
course<00:03:32.450> deal<00:03:32.750> on<00:03:32.900> would<00:03:33.080> have<00:03:33.110> been<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.650> much

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
course deal on would have been a much

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.030 
course deal on would have been a much
smaller<00:03:34.370> than<00:03:34.610> neuter<00:03:35.000> Alice<00:03:35.800> but<00:03:36.800> I<00:03:36.830> just

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
smaller than neuter Alice but I just

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.020 
smaller than neuter Alice but I just
like<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:37.520> how<00:03:38.800> what<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.130> first

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
like to see how what the first

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.190 
like to see how what the first
tyrannosaurs<00:03:41.720> actually<00:03:42.200> look<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:44.200> they're

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
tyrannosaurs actually look like they're

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.130 
tyrannosaurs actually look like they're
quite<00:03:45.530> an<00:03:45.650> odd<00:03:45.860> looking<00:03:46.160> bunch<00:03:47.140> especially

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
quite an odd looking bunch especially

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.110 
quite an odd looking bunch especially
with<00:03:48.320> these<00:03:48.470> love<00:03:49.780> three<00:03:50.780> clawed<00:03:51.410> arms<00:03:55.120> so

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.900 
with these love three clawed arms so
yeah<00:03:56.420> that's<00:03:56.750> my<00:03:57.430> review<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.640> Carnegie

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910

deal I mean if you do like from the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.480 
deal I mean if you do like from the
dinosaurs<00:04:00.830> I<00:04:01.040> would<00:04:01.370> pick<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.090> guy<00:04:02.330> up<00:04:02.360> he<00:04:02.690> is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
dinosaurs I would pick this guy up he is

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.970 
dinosaurs I would pick this guy up he is
very<00:04:04.490> nice<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.200> would<00:04:06.410> do<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.680> quickly
