battling against Ricardo because he had

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.010

then in the incident with him okay I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.980 
then in the incident with him okay I
thought<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.000> my<00:01:16.120> point<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.360> view<00:01:16.480> is<00:01:16.600> my<00:01:16.750> corner

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.780 
thought so my point of view is my corner
because<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.440> got<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.830> corner<00:01:18.070> properly<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.640> he

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
because I got the corner properly and he

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.490 
because I got the corner properly and he
completely<00:01:19.210> overdid<00:01:19.540> it

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
completely overdid it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.380 
completely overdid it
nevertheless<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> on<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.090> exit<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
nevertheless on the on the exit the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.820 
nevertheless on the on the exit the
corner<00:01:23.600> his<00:01:23.750> front<00:01:24.050> wing<00:01:24.230> was<00:01:24.440> still<00:01:24.650> right

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
corner his front wing was still right

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.680 
corner his front wing was still right
next<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.100> my<00:01:25.220> rear<00:01:25.370> tire<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.880> punctured<00:01:26.660> my

sucks<00:01:37.210> Nico<00:01:38.210> has<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:38.450> say<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:39.020> let's<00:01:39.200> see<00:01:39.380> what

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
sucks Nico has to say now let's see what

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.340 
sucks Nico has to say now let's see what
team<00:01:39.710> Buster<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.160> wolf<00:01:40.370> thinks<00:01:47.050> he<00:01:48.050> had<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.320> a

team Buster the wolf thinks he had was a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.310 
team Buster the wolf thinks he had was a
really<00:01:48.620> bad<00:01:48.800> day<00:01:48.980> in<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.190> office

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
really bad day in the office

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.010 
really bad day in the office
we<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:51.770> end<00:01:51.950> up<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.190> p6<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.910> p8<00:01:53.090> which<00:01:53.660> if<00:01:53.900> you

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
we we end up in p6 and p8 which if you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.900 
we we end up in p6 and p8 which if you
start<00:01:54.290> from<00:01:54.470> p1<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.979> p2<00:01:55.100> isn't<00:01:55.490> exactly<00:01:55.790> the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
start from p1 and p2 isn't exactly the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.660 
start from p1 and p2 isn't exactly the
result<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.510> expect<00:01:56.900> but<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:58.100> had<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:58.550> many

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
result you expect but we had so many

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.810 
result you expect but we had so many
things<00:01:58.910> going<00:01:59.180> wrong<00:01:59.560> we<00:02:00.560> had<00:02:00.800> two<00:02:01.130> restarts

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
things going wrong we had two restarts

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.750 
things going wrong we had two restarts
which<00:02:02.600> were<00:02:02.810> which<00:02:03.500> were<00:02:03.650> not<00:02:03.740> good<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.190> then

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
which were which were not good and then

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.949 
which were which were not good and then
we<00:02:04.880> had<00:02:05.060> Louis<00:02:05.990> going<00:02:06.259> off<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.650> lap<00:02:06.860> one<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
we had Louis going off in lap one and

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.170 
we had Louis going off in lap one and
two<00:02:08.959> shunts<00:02:09.320> two<00:02:09.920> crashes<00:02:10.190> on<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.670> nikuman

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
two shunts two crashes on the nikuman

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.490 
two shunts two crashes on the nikuman
with<00:02:11.330> Louisa<00:02:12.670> punctures<00:02:13.870> front<00:02:14.870> wings<00:02:15.110> lost

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
with Louisa punctures front wings lost

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.330 
with Louisa punctures front wings lost
so<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.660> not<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.290> more<00:02:18.560> expected<00:02:18.980> more

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
so there is not to be more expected more

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.520 
so there is not to be more expected more
with<00:02:19.760> these<00:02:19.880> kind<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.240> incidents<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:24.380> were

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
with these kind of incidents they were

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.800 
with these kind of incidents they were
very<00:02:24.740> quick<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.459> would<00:02:25.850> say<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.390> were<00:02:26.600> from

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
very quick I would say that we were from

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.520 
very quick I would say that we were from
the<00:02:27.050> pure<00:02:27.290> ace<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:29.660> were<00:02:29.780> probably<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.140> still

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
the pure ace we were probably the still

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.259 
the pure ace we were probably the still
the<00:02:30.620> quickest<00:02:30.920> car<00:02:31.130> on<00:02:31.250> Sunday<00:02:31.640> not<00:02:31.970> with<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
the quickest car on Sunday not with the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.810 
the quickest car on Sunday not with the
gap<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.690> had<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:32.959> Saturday<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.580> looked

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
gap we had on Saturday but it looked

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.470 
gap we had on Saturday but it looked
solid<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:36.519> Nico<00:02:37.519> started<00:02:37.880> with<00:02:37.970> pace<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.390> his

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
solid but Nico started with pace in his

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.040 
solid but Nico started with pace in his
car<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.959> Lewis<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.519> he<00:02:40.670> run<00:02:40.880> wide<00:02:41.420> through

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
car and Lewis when he run wide through

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
the gravel bed in lap one he lost quite

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.000 
the gravel bed in lap one he lost quite
some<00:02:44.180> air<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.600> performance<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.350> taking<00:02:45.980> that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
some air of performance so taking that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.190 
some air of performance so taking that
into<00:02:46.130> consideration<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:47.150> think<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.510> were<00:02:47.660> we

is what way we need to improve it was

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 
is what way we need to improve it was
overheated<00:03:09.280> clutches

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
overheated clutches

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.780 
overheated clutches
it<00:03:10.870> was<00:03:11.140> Nico<00:03:11.620> was<00:03:11.770> on<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> wrong<00:03:12.099> side<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.580> the

it was Nico was on the wrong side of the

it was Nico was on the wrong side of the
of<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.209> grid<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:14.020> he<00:03:14.140> start<00:03:14.440> actually<00:03:14.650> wasn't

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
of the grid so he start actually wasn't

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.670 
of the grid so he start actually wasn't
wasn't<00:03:15.700> as<00:03:15.849> bad<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:17.080> need<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.290> work

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
wasn't as bad and we just need to work

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620 
wasn't as bad and we just need to work
on<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.920> procedure<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.760> was<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> coincident

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
on the procedure it was a coincident

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.370 
on the procedure it was a coincident
coincidence<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.830> came<00:03:21.040> together<00:03:21.250> and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
coincidence that it came together and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.520 
coincidence that it came together and
shouldn't<00:03:23.380> be<00:03:23.500> happening<00:03:23.680> again

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
shouldn't be happening again

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.350 
shouldn't be happening again
yeah<00:03:26.530> still<00:03:26.800> a<00:03:26.860> couple<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.250> taste<00:03:27.489> flied<00:03:28.330> out

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
yeah still a couple of taste flied out

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.770 
yeah still a couple of taste flied out
until<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.500> starts<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:30.970> one<00:03:31.180> wotty<00:03:31.420> km

Lewis will be back on track and spa next

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.170 
Lewis will be back on track and spa next
month<00:03:47.319> but<00:03:47.860> before<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.370> Formula<00:03:48.880> One<00:03:49.030> is

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180

month but before that Formula One is
going<00:03:49.450> on<00:03:49.569> summer<00:03:49.780> break<00:03:49.870> but<00:03:50.350> what<00:03:51.100> does<00:03:51.190> that

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
going on summer break but what does that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.710 
going on summer break but what does that
actually<00:03:51.340> mean<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.030> how<00:03:52.120> much<00:03:52.299> is<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> team

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
actually mean and how much is the team

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.690 
actually mean and how much is the team
allowed<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.080> do<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.530> could<00:03:54.130> have<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.280> petty<00:03:54.519> low

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
allowed to do I could have a petty low

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.380 
allowed to do I could have a petty low
to<00:03:54.760> find<00:03:55.060> out

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.260 

shuts<00:04:01.380> down<00:04:01.590> actually<00:04:01.890> it's<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.520> by<00:04:02.670> regulation

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
development of the car at all a very

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.440 
development of the car at all a very
good<00:04:12.660> system<00:04:13.350> actually<00:04:13.560> was<00:04:14.450> introduced

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
good system actually was introduced

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.599 
good system actually was introduced
about<00:04:16.049> five<00:04:16.440> years<00:04:16.650> ago<00:04:16.980> six<00:04:17.310> years<00:04:17.370> ago<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
about five years ago six years ago and

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.550 
about five years ago six years ago and
saves<00:04:20.609> money<00:04:20.840> which<00:04:21.840> was<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.170> original

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
saves money which was the original

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.340 
saves money which was the original
intention<00:04:23.030> but<00:04:24.030> also<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.020> world<00:04:25.170> of

Formula One which is these days non-stop

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.350 
Formula One which is these days non-stop
used<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.650> be<00:04:28.770> cyclic<00:04:29.250> who<00:04:29.550> were<00:04:29.700> busy<00:04:29.970> times<00:04:30.210> of

now it's flat out all the time and to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.450 
now it's flat out all the time and to
have<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.180> two-week<00:04:36.720> effectively<00:04:37.620> ceasefire

they can't do any work is actually

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.850 
they can't do any work is actually
fantastic<00:04:44.669> for<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.390> families<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.590> may<00:04:46.800> be

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
fantastic for the families it may be

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.670 
fantastic for the families it may be
else<00:04:47.720> people<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.870> actually<00:04:49.230> have<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.380> tree

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
else people to actually have a tree

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.720 
else people to actually have a tree
break<00:04:49.980> truly<00:04:50.940> switch<00:04:51.210> off<00:04:51.450> from<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.320> job<00:04:52.730> for

me<00:04:53.850> one<00:04:54.000> has<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.210> habit<00:04:54.450> of<00:04:54.630> attracting

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
me one has a habit of attracting

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.409 
me one has a habit of attracting
workaholics<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.780> families<00:04:58.169> do<00:04:58.350> suffer

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
workaholics and the families do suffer

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.540 
workaholics and the families do suffer
quite<00:05:00.419> often<00:05:00.570> from<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.200> so<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.980> think<00:05:02.190> all<00:05:02.520> in

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
quite often from that so I think all in

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.790 
quite often from that so I think all in
all<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:03.090> very<00:05:03.240> good<00:05:03.690> system<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:07.440> doing<00:05:07.680> that

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
all a very good system so doing that

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.820 
all a very good system so doing that
page<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.130> can<00:05:08.310> do<00:05:09.350> tasks<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.470> are<00:05:10.650> not

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
page you can do tasks that are not

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.280 
page you can do tasks that are not
related<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.880> development<00:05:12.540> in<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.750> car<00:05:12.930> itself

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
related to development in the car itself

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.409 
related to development in the car itself
so<00:05:13.650> for<00:05:13.680> instance<00:05:14.130> we<00:05:14.430> will<00:05:14.669> have<00:05:14.880> people<00:05:15.150> in

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
so for instance we will have people in

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.390 
so for instance we will have people in
here<00:05:15.450> from<00:05:16.440> some<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.830> support<00:05:17.190> functions

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
here from some of the support functions

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.620 
here from some of the support functions
so<00:05:18.000> Finance<00:05:18.570> for<00:05:18.870> instance<00:05:19.260> or<00:05:20.479> marketing<00:05:21.479> in

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
so Finance for instance or marketing in

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.560 
so Finance for instance or marketing in
fact<00:05:21.900> doesn't<00:05:22.410> get<00:05:22.800> captured<00:05:23.040> and<00:05:24.000> also

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
fact doesn't get captured and also

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.469 
fact doesn't get captured and also
people<00:05:24.990> working<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:25.919> infrastructure<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.330> if

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
people working on infrastructure so if

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.600 
people working on infrastructure so if
you<00:05:27.660> have<00:05:27.810> machines<00:05:28.260> that<00:05:28.470> need<00:05:28.800> replacing<00:05:29.250> in

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
you have machines that need replacing in

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.030 
you have machines that need replacing in
the<00:05:29.700> machine<00:05:30.030> shop<00:05:30.290> it's<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:31.350> very<00:05:31.560> good<00:05:31.710> time

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
the machine shop it's a very good time

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.690 
the machine shop it's a very good time
to<00:05:33.020> replace<00:05:34.020> those<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:37.770> with<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.370> two-week

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
to replace those so with the two-week

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
to replace those so with the two-week
gap<00:05:38.910> I<00:05:39.650> shut<00:05:40.650> down<00:05:40.890> in<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:41.729> four<00:05:42.000> week<00:05:42.180> race<00:05:42.390> gap

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
gap I shut down in a four week race gap

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.570 
gap I shut down in a four week race gap
in<00:05:42.990> effect<00:05:43.350> it's<00:05:43.590> equivalent<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.400> having

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
in effect it's equivalent to having

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.210 
in effect it's equivalent to having
known<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:45.630> weave<00:05:45.810> gap<00:05:46.050> between<00:05:46.229> races<00:05:46.890> so

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
known to weave gap between races so

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.610 
known to weave gap between races so
actually<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.210> pattern<00:05:48.630> which<00:05:48.960> Apollo<00:05:49.200> is

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
actually the pattern which Apollo is

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.969 
actually the pattern which Apollo is
very<00:05:50.070> conventional<00:05:50.370> for<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:50.970> to<00:05:51.690> race<00:05:52.050> gap<00:05:52.380> so

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
very conventional for a to race gap so

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.159 
very conventional for a to race gap so
the<00:05:53.100> cars<00:05:53.310> will<00:05:53.520> be<00:05:53.550> being<00:05:53.940> stripped<00:05:54.240> this

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
the cars will be being stripped this

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.150 
the cars will be being stripped this
week<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:55.890> then<00:05:56.690> rebuilt<00:05:57.690> a<00:05:58.169> bit<00:05:58.710> this<00:05:58.890> week

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
week and then rebuilt a bit this week

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.240 
week and then rebuilt a bit this week
and<00:05:59.430> mostly<00:05:59.940> during<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.810> beginning<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.470> the

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
and mostly during the beginning of the
