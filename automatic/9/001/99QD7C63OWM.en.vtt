00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
headlamps but but anyways yeah it's a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.830 
headlamps but but anyways yeah it's a
pretty<00:00:39.059> cool<00:00:39.270> looking<00:00:39.570> car

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840

not<00:00:40.410> sure<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:40.980> bigger<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.910> smaller<00:00:42.210> than

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
not sure if it's bigger or smaller than

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
not sure if it's bigger or smaller than
my<00:00:42.660> Buick<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.260> converters<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.829> comparison
