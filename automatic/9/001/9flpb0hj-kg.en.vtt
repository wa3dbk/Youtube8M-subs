00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
blow out routine now I'm just detangling

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.070 
blow out routine now I'm just detangling
my<00:00:07.560> hair<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.580> make<00:00:08.760> sure<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.240> I'd<00:00:09.420> get<00:00:09.719> rid<00:00:10.050> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
my hair to make sure that I'd get rid of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.650 
my hair to make sure that I'd get rid of
any<00:00:10.380> shed<00:00:10.769> hairs<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:12.150> my<00:00:12.360> hair<00:00:12.630> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
any shed hairs and that my hair is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.049 
any shed hairs and that my hair is
smooth<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.500> tangle<00:00:13.950> free<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.790> run<00:00:15.030> my

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
smooth and tangle free so I can run my

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.260 
smooth and tangle free so I can run my
comb<00:00:15.599> through<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.320> tend<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> use<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.640> larger

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
comb through it I tend to use a larger

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.800 
comb through it I tend to use a larger
wide<00:00:19.020> tooth<00:00:19.410> comb<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.150> then<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.210> break<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
wide tooth comb and then I break the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.700 
wide tooth comb and then I break the
section<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.380> half<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> smaller<00:00:23.970> manageable

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
section in half for a smaller manageable

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.310 
section in half for a smaller manageable
sections<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.420> then<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.840> pinning<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
sections and then I'm just pinning this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400 
sections and then I'm just pinning this
away<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> ease<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
away so that I can have the ease of a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.700 
away so that I can have the ease of a
smaller<00:00:31.800> section<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> once<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.410> smaller

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
smaller section so once I get my smaller

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
smaller section so once I get my smaller
section<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> wide<00:00:36.300> tooth
