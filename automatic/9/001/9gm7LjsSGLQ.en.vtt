00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.930
 here's the focus on burning such an exercise 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 the second phase of the push is the push of the bar with 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.610
 chest now I'll tell you a few 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.700
 tell show some exercises for 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.110
 working out the technique of push from the chest is 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.660
 push scissors 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.740
 delay before pushing out second 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.290
 exercise this push 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.300
 because of the head either speaking from the back and 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.940
 the third exercise that I want to show 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.670
 it's fodder jolt 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 ok friends now we will try them 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.559
 Exercises like push barbell chest 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 delay before ejection delay 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.220
 before you push out in order to 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.750
 feel the weight and to push 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.050
 amid the fatigue of the trace 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.800
 static stress when we keep 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.200
 34 seconds 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.230
 some longer holds to after 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.420
 this voltage we could on the box 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.420
 shrink and fall barbell up 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.940
 it is necessary for practicing also on 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.220
 small scales of that effort which 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.630
 appear we apply on big scales 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.750
 back arched 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.180
 blades try to take back that is 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.280
 Patsy Yes, and we also try not to divert 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.050
 knees forward like this and not 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.570
 enter the pelvis forward then there is something behind 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.970
 the loin is arched Kohl do not enter 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.760
 a little to the side 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.260
 takes and pushes immediately up from 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.920
 the main error the main nuances in this 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.070
 exercise when we do delay 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.380
 then squat and you talkie here you need 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.510
 from this height strandberg you are here 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.870
 not that way and scatter legs in 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.870
 scissors 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.850
 need all naturally when we 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.540
 separated save here the nuances of all those 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.900
 same as with the usual jolt pro 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.550
 chest 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.200
 front foot can be left can 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.100
 be the rights of all differently that is, we stand 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.560
 at full foot 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.110
 angle between lower leg and hip more than 90 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.540
 degrees is ideally that is leg 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.630
 wrapped slightly to the right 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 back leg standing on the toe to toe on 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.760
 wrapped the other way and legs rough 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.580
 saying here we put the cross over 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.020
 that is, we reduce our legs like this 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.900
 steel again not on the same line 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.080
 divorced in different planes on different 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.080
 lines 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.500
 also you us that the load is evenly 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.120
 distributed between two legs i mean we 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.280
 not are drawn forward is not given here 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.730
 located in the middle of this would be here 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.070
 nuances that are characteristic of any 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.870
 push scissors 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.870
 a delay has passed 1 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.830
 second push rod control due 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.350
 heads in this exercise center of gravity 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.570
 rods the center of gravity of the body they 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.850
 almost equilibrium that is, we are not 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.570
 pulls on socks as the first case 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.470
 push rod 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.959
 breasts and we can work out exactly 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.209
 raznozhka most-most scissors since 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.730
 the weight in this exercise is much greater than 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.100
 funny specials will be omitted if we do 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.660
 several times on the back there and on large 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.320
 scales can not always adequately with 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.110
 using depreciation but by itself this 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.360
 energy extinguish sit back bump 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.700
 so if we guys reach big 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.620
 we do weights on 1 and reset to 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.290
 scaffold or on special stands and 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.900
 write off skirting high then we reset 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.680
 they just leave short 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.769
 and scatter the legs here is an exercise 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.239
 also there are of course variations of it 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.310
 I showed the previous pro out delay 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.670
 it can also be done with a delay then 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.239
 have linger 35 seconds and immediately 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.239
 up 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.640
 i tried exercises noise bench press 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.460
 grip we work out the promise which 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.230
 necessary for pushing from the chest and 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.880
 We are working on boosting and retaining top 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.520
 to form 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.550
 good key course feet set wider 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.140
 shoulders so that the position was stable to 5 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.020
 centimeters from practitioners to the shoulder 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.890
 short semi squat and powerful push out 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.890
 up and push your hands 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.229
 click it is important that we were on the direct 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.360
 feet 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.979
 that is, do not leave again there 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.330
 variations of this exercise are more 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.759
 lite option when the task is 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.229
 work along the axis without loading the arms 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.229
 then do about the athletes 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.920
 with this option we get 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.410
 work out the pushing out and under the sedate 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.450
 that is, there are no such elements as 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.180
 scissors but promise up and move up 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.340
 the very end is almost identical 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.350
 but here we are working on a powerful message 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.870
 up there is another exercise which 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.410
 essentially variations is schwung will 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.060
 press push grip done on 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.500
 incredible large forests that is it 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.260
 of course determines the coach but much 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.780
 there are 30 to 40 percent more than 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.540
 push from the chest, too, work out 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.010
 allow the promise we do the pushing and 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.260
 heading away just headquarters 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.960
 we try to push as far as possible 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.700
 haystacks followed by when the bar is already 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.320
 so naturally hang such a big weight 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.080
 which is more than ours. but for many it 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:38.620
 You will not fail here this position, we simply 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.620
 moving away from it letting the bar fall 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.530
 friends in our channel arma sport we already 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.620
 dismantled a lot of exercises for jerk for 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.830
 push themselves understood and movement 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.500
 Many questions arise during the process. 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.270
 write your questions in the comments 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.360
 leave we will be guided not 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.920
 in order to shoot new videos to everyone 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.920
 thanks, bye
