ranger and I highly highly suggested

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.399 
ranger and I highly highly suggested
because<00:01:27.289> it's<00:01:27.500> nonstick<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.049> it<00:01:30.049> means<00:01:30.229> that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
because it's nonstick and it means that

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.929 
because it's nonstick and it means that
i<00:01:30.469> can<00:01:30.500> use<00:01:30.860> my<00:01:31.100> mat<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.810> blend<00:01:33.110> my<00:01:33.289> colors<00:01:33.939> so

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
i can use my mat to blend my colors so

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.849 
i can use my mat to blend my colors so
what<00:01:35.030> I'm<00:01:35.119> doing<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:35.479> my<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:35.960> 21<00:01:36.469> I'm<00:01:36.680> just

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
picking up some of the darker color and

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.600 
picking up some of the darker color and
it<00:01:40.820> makes<00:01:41.030> for<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.270> really<00:01:41.570> nice<00:01:42.579> blended<00:01:43.579> luck
