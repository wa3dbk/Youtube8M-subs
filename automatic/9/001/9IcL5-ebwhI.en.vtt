to hit our render and as you can see is

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.589 
to hit our render and as you can see is
rented<00:02:42.470> out<00:02:42.590> camera<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.400> wanted<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.909> change

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
rented out camera so we wanted to change

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.149 
rented out camera so we wanted to change
some<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.200> options<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.799> render

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
some of the options in the render

some of the options in the render
settings<00:02:46.599> we<00:02:47.599> wanted<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.019> be<00:02:48.140> camera<00:02:48.500> one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670

choosy<00:02:49.670> depth<00:02:49.940> at<00:02:50.239> alpha<00:02:50.780> channel<00:02:51.109> so<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:52.220> we

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
choosy depth at alpha channel so what we

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.940 
choosy depth at alpha channel so what we
want<00:02:52.750> change<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.019> image<00:02:54.260> format<00:02:54.650> we're<00:02:54.829> going

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
want change the image format we're going

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.190 
want change the image format we're going
to<00:02:55.010> use<00:02:55.129> PNG<00:02:55.370> because<00:02:56.090> it's<00:02:56.329> quite<00:02:56.569> simple<00:02:56.959> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
to use PNG because it's quite simple and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.229 
to use PNG because it's quite simple and
small<00:02:57.560> size<00:03:00.340> change<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:02.349> movi<00:03:03.349> frame

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
small size change this to movi frame

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.960 
small size change this to movi frame
here<00:03:05.239> or<00:03:05.599> like<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:08.290> we<00:03:09.290> don't<00:03:09.470> need<00:03:09.859> more<00:03:10.760> add

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
here or like that we don't need more add

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.520 
here or like that we don't need more add
a<00:03:11.000> bit<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.299> padding<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.810> basically<00:03:12.319> if

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
a bit of padding that basically if

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.990 
a bit of padding that basically if
you've<00:03:12.680> got<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.829> lot<00:03:13.129> of<00:03:13.159> frame<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.700> want

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
you've got a lot of frame so you want

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.339 
you've got a lot of frame so you want
more<00:03:14.120> padding<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:14.720> basically<00:03:15.019> how<00:03:15.290> many

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
more padding that's basically how many

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.520 
more padding that's basically how many
zeros<00:03:15.889> before<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.459> number<00:03:17.139> quite<00:03:18.139> useful

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
zeros before the number quite useful

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.479 

we've<00:04:16.380> got<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> few<00:04:16.889> new<00:04:17.130> frames<00:04:17.489> here<00:04:19.489> now

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
we've got a few new frames here now

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.029 
we've got a few new frames here now
because<00:04:20.910> they<00:04:21.060> don't<00:04:21.299> not<00:04:21.570> list<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:21.989> as<00:04:22.139> PNG

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.740 
can see we've got a nice simple
animation<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.850> we<00:04:30.030> can<00:04:30.210> bring<00:04:30.449> there<00:04:30.600> to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750

animation that we can bring there to
After<00:04:31.080> Effects<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:32.820> we've<00:04:32.940> saved<00:04:33.180> our<00:04:33.360> files

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690

we've<00:04:34.320> exported<00:04:34.860> our<00:04:35.160> sea<00:04:35.400> creams<00:04:35.720> now

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
we've exported our sea creams now

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.120 
we've exported our sea creams now
obviously<00:04:37.169> depending<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:37.889> software

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
obviously depending on what software

you're using so depend on what you want

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.450 
you're using so depend on what you want
to<00:04:41.580> export<00:04:42.090> out<00:04:42.330> but<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.500> bottom<00:04:43.740> line<00:04:43.800> is<00:04:43.949> Eve

now<00:04:44.910> exported<00:04:45.690> ur<00:04:46.639> ready<00:04:47.639> to<00:04:47.910> use<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.270> another

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
now exported ur ready to use in another

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.420 
now exported ur ready to use in another
application<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.770> hope<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.250> was<00:04:50.400> useful
