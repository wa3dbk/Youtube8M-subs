in<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.840> net<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.290> easily

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
in the net very easily

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.639 
in the net very easily
we've<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.820> your<00:01:59.939> landing<00:02:00.299> net<00:02:00.479> setup<00:02:00.960> right

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
we've got your landing net setup right

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.370 
we've got your landing net setup right
next<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> box<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:02.969> left-handed

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
next to the box now you're left-handed

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
next to the box now you're left-handed
so<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.590> why<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> nets<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:05.969> side

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so that's why the nets on the right side

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.070 
so that's why the nets on the right side
but<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.409> about<00:02:07.680> maximising<00:02:08.580> your

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
but it's all about maximising your

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
but it's all about maximising your
tackle<00:02:10.080> very<00:02:10.649> efficiently<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.700> peg<00:02:11.879> okay

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
tackle very efficiently on your peg okay

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.520 
tackle very efficiently on your peg okay
so<00:02:12.450> once<00:02:12.810> you're<00:02:13.020> there

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so once you're there

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920 
so once you're there
you're<00:02:13.680> set<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.640> ready<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.060> roll<00:02:15.270> yeah<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you're set you're ready to roll yeah and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.559 
you're set you're ready to roll yeah and
you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.200> keep<00:02:16.410> moving<00:02:16.920> absolutely<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.000> see

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
you can keep moving absolutely I see

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.770 
you can keep moving absolutely I see
we've<00:02:18.750> got<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.620> poll<00:02:19.860> back<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.490> James<00:02:21.150> can

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
we've got the poll back here James can

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
we've got the poll back here James can
you<00:02:21.870> explain<00:02:22.200> about<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.620> well<00:02:22.770> that's<00:02:22.950> as

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you explain about this well that's as

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.860 
you explain about this well that's as
you<00:02:23.790> know<00:02:23.910> we're<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.300> fish<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.690> long

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you know we're going to fish with a long

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.290 
you know we're going to fish with a long
pole<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> actually<00:02:26.790> ship<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
pole so we have to actually ship the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.710 
pole so we have to actually ship the
pole<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:28.980> during<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.090> fish

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
pole in and out during the fish

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.150 
pole in and out during the fish
capturing<00:02:31.110> process<00:02:31.319> okay

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
capturing process okay

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.870 
capturing process okay
so<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.489> were<00:02:32.580> actually<00:02:32.819> using<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.180> pole<00:02:33.450> roller

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
so we were actually using a pole roller

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.370 
so we were actually using a pole roller
which<00:02:35.880> helps<00:02:36.209> make<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> job<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:37.230> easy

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
which helps make the job really easy

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.440 
which helps make the job really easy
you'll<00:02:38.250> notice<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.760> I've<00:02:38.880> positioned<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
you'll notice that I've positioned the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.010 
you'll notice that I've positioned the
pole<00:02:39.690> roller<00:02:40.700> about<00:02:41.700> half<00:02:41.940> way<00:02:42.209> back<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.780> terms

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
pole roller about half way back in terms

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.020 
pole roller about half way back in terms
of<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> distance<00:02:43.620> from<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.980> box<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
of the distance from the box to the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.880 
of the distance from the box to the
length<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> pole<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.470> case<00:02:46.709> we're

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
length of the pole in this case we're

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.560 
length of the pole in this case we're
fishing<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.310> eight<00:02:47.459> meters<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.060> start<00:02:48.360> with

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
fishing with eight meters to start with

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.660 
fishing with eight meters to start with
so<00:02:49.200> I've<00:02:49.320> got<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> pole<00:02:49.800> roll<00:02:50.040> around<00:02:50.280> about

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
so I've got the pole roll around about

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850 
so I've got the pole roll around about
four<00:02:50.970> meters<00:02:51.450> four<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> half<00:02:51.900> meters<00:02:52.170> back

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
four meters four and a half meters back

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
four meters four and a half meters back
from<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.220> fishing<00:02:53.550> station<00:02:54.030> okay<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
from the fishing station okay so that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.259 
from the fishing station okay so that
just<00:02:54.989> simply<00:02:55.320> means<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.820> ship<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
just simply means that you can ship the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.320 
just simply means that you can ship the
pole<00:02:57.510> out<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.200> roller<00:02:59.180> backwards<00:03:00.180> and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
pole out on the roller backwards and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.750 
pole out on the roller backwards and
forwards<00:03:00.810> very<00:03:01.560> smoothly<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.250> easily<00:03:02.459> you

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
forwards very smoothly and easily you

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.650 
forwards very smoothly and easily you
can<00:03:02.940> see<00:03:03.090> how<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.300> roll<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.870> very<00:03:04.080> stable<00:03:04.860> and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
can see how the roll is very stable and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.320 
can see how the roll is very stable and
obviously<00:03:06.660> help<00:03:07.019> good<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> perfect

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
obviously help good it's the perfect

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.090 
obviously help good it's the perfect
balance<00:03:09.690> point<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> length<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.890> pole

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
balance point for the length of pole

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.009 
balance point for the length of pole
that<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.310> use<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> other<00:03:12.690> thing<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
that you use it and the other thing to

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.420 
that you use it and the other thing to
think<00:03:13.230> about<00:03:13.319> when<00:03:13.680> you're<00:03:13.800> using<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.220> pole

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
think about when you're using a pole

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.340 
think about when you're using a pole
wall<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.819> is<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.330> keeps<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> pole<00:03:15.959> off<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
wall that is it keeps the pole off the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.250 
wall that is it keeps the pole off the
ground<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.850> more<00:03:18.060> visible<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:19.049> know<00:03:19.170> if

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
ground so it's more visible you know if

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.870 
ground so it's more visible you know if
somebody's<00:03:19.680> walking<00:03:19.860> along<00:03:20.400> they're<00:03:20.730> going

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
somebody's walking along they're going

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.130 
somebody's walking along they're going
to<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.209> leave<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.360> walk<00:03:21.630> around<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.019> will

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
to have to leave a walk around it will

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.900 
to have to leave a walk around it will
walk<00:03:22.350> over<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.920> rather<00:03:23.280> than<00:03:23.519> maybe<00:03:23.670> not

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
walk over it rather than maybe not

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.460 
walk over it rather than maybe not
seeing<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.329> tread<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.019> also<00:03:25.260> I

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
seeing it and tread on it so also I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.930 
seeing it and tread on it so also I
suppose<00:03:25.890> you're<00:03:26.190> not<00:03:26.220> going<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.549> damage<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
suppose you're not going to damage the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
suppose you're not going to damage the
end<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.420> pole<00:03:27.660> by<00:03:27.900> running<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:28.650> over

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
end of the pole by running it back over

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.710 
end of the pole by running it back over
rough<00:03:29.250> ground<00:03:29.280> absolutely<00:03:30.239> if<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:30.510> were<00:03:30.570> to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
rough ground absolutely if you were to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.750 
rough ground absolutely if you were to
do<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:30.900> if<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.350> were<00:03:31.440> literally<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.950> ship

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
do that if you were literally to ship

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.699 
do that if you were literally to ship
the<00:03:32.880> pole<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.329> ground<00:03:33.690> you'd<00:03:34.079> get<00:03:34.290> grit

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
the pole on the ground you'd get grit

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.390 
the pole on the ground you'd get grit
and<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.160> sorts<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:36.350> dirt<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.709> inside<00:03:38.220> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and all sorts of dirt in the inside the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.979 
and all sorts of dirt in the inside the
pole<00:03:38.640> that's<00:03:38.850> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> damage<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.450> pole<00:03:39.780> and

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
pole that's going to damage the pole and

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.810 
pole that's going to damage the pole and
cause<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.350> problems<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:41.040> where<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.549> pull

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
cause you problems and where you pull

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.479 
cause you problems and where you pull
out<00:03:41.850> basically<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.049> maximizing<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
out basically so this is maximizing the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.910 
out basically so this is maximizing the
efficiency<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:45.060> your<00:03:45.239> pole<00:03:45.560> well<00:03:46.560> touch<00:03:46.769> on

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
efficiency of your pole well touch on

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.090 
efficiency of your pole well touch on
you<00:03:47.100> you've<00:03:47.370> got<00:03:47.549> your<00:03:48.470> rod<00:03:49.470> hold<00:03:49.709> all<00:03:49.859> here

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
you you've got your rod hold all here

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.890 
you you've got your rod hold all here
yeah<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.850> have<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.299> rod<00:03:51.510> back<00:03:51.720> behind

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
me in this position so I couldn't place

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.420 
me in this position so I couldn't place
other<00:03:55.109> sections<00:03:55.620> maybe<00:03:55.920> if<00:03:56.130> we're<00:03:56.340> not

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
other sections maybe if we're not

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.410 
other sections maybe if we're not
fishing<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:56.940> far<00:03:57.180> out

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
fishing this far out

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
maybe if we've got two lines so I rate

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.270 
maybe if we've got two lines so I rate
meter<00:03:59.970> line<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.660> four<00:04:01.380> or<00:04:01.410> five<00:04:01.590> meter<00:04:01.980> line

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
meter line in a four or five meter line
