00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
cards so now we have one soo in three

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.970 
cards so now we have one soo in three
cards<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> spectator<00:00:58.590> yes<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
cards and I just have a spectator yes I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.619 
cards and I just have a spectator yes I
the<00:00:59.039> spectator<00:00:59.430> hold<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> cars<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.390> now

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the spectator hold the cars and now

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
the spectator hold the cars and now
packages<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> destroy<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:03.210> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
packages to destroy if I just like that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.850 
packages to destroy if I just like that
I<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:03.960> card<00:01:04.379> over<00:01:04.589> flip<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I think which one card over flip the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.280 
I think which one card over flip the
card<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.390> that's<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> car<00:01:06.659> king<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> hearts

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
card and that's the car king of hearts

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.740 
card and that's the car king of hearts
alright<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> trick<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:09.299> easy<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
alright so this trick is really easy to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.270 
alright so this trick is really easy to
do<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.650> probably<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.100> five

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
do it just probably will take five

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440 
do it just probably will take five
minutes<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> practice<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.090> you'll<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.299> get

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
minutes of practice and you'll just get

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
minutes of practice and you'll just get
it<00:01:12.570> down<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.640> have

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it down so what you do is you just have

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
it down so what you do is you just have
a<00:01:14.970> spectator<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> course<00:01:15.840> take<00:01:16.500> any<00:01:16.680> card<00:01:16.890> they

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
a spectator of course take any card they

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
a spectator of course take any card they
want<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.759> time<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> take<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.689> cartoon<00:01:19.049> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
want so we time to take this cartoon is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
want so we time to take this cartoon is
clubs<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.310> put<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.790> top<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
clubs just have them put it on top of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
clubs just have them put it on top of
the<00:01:21.210> deck<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:23.009> after<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> we're

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the deck like this and after that we're

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
the deck like this and after that we're
going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> cut<00:01:24.689> caught<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> move<00:01:25.229> called

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
going to do is cut caught a move called

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
going to do is cut caught a move called
the<00:01:25.979> false<00:01:26.340> cut<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> basically<00:01:28.080> meaning

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the false cut this is basically meaning

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.219 
the false cut this is basically meaning
that<00:01:28.530> you're<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.250> cutting<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> cards

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
that you're not really cutting the cards

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.330 
that you're not really cutting the cards
you're<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.470> faking<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.100> cutting

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you're just faking that you're cutting

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.530 
you're just faking that you're cutting
it<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:32.909> other<00:01:33.060> technology

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it so this is what other technology

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.270 
it so this is what other technology
kotenok<00:01:34.110> lives<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> top<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.100> like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
kotenok lives on the top I just like

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
kotenok lives on the top I just like
this<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> type<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> cut<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:36.930> not

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
this kind of the type of cut but I'm not

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
this kind of the type of cut but I'm not
really<00:01:37.229> cutting<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> into<00:01:38.579> 10<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> 10<00:01:39.030> pounds

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
really cutting it into 10 to 10 pounds

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.710 
really cutting it into 10 to 10 pounds
is<00:01:39.360> still<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> top<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.770> move

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
is still on the top so for this move

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.880 
is still on the top so for this move
just<00:01:41.900> going<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.080> have<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.200> take<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.440> portion<00:01:42.710> off

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
just going to have to take a portion off

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.710 
just going to have to take a portion off
like<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.690> like<00:01:44.720> this<00:01:45.010> down<00:01:46.010> down<00:01:46.730> okay

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
like this and like this down down okay

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.260 
like this and like this down down okay
so<00:01:47.780> I'll<00:01:47.930> do<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.080> one<00:01:48.200> more<00:01:48.230> time<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.150> take<00:01:50.150> the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
so I'll do it one more time so take the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.120 
so I'll do it one more time so take the
top<00:01:50.450> portion<00:01:50.630> off<00:01:50.870> put<00:01:51.770> internet<00:01:52.130> like<00:01:52.370> this

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
top portion off put internet like this

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.850 
top portion off put internet like this
like<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:55.880> down<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.320> down<00:01:57.470> it's

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
like that and then down and down it's

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920 
like that and then down and down it's
pretty<00:01:57.980> straightforward<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:58.940> but<00:01:59.690> if

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
pretty straightforward like that but if

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.840 
pretty straightforward like that but if
you<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.170> fast<00:02:00.410> nobody<00:02:00.680> will<00:02:00.860> notice<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.400> so

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
you do it fast nobody will notice it so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.150 
you do it fast nobody will notice it so
I<00:02:01.880> have<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.440> still<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.920> ten

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
I have to do that so you still have ten

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.430 
I have to do that so you still have ten
of<00:02:04.280> clubs<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.730> top<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.120> deck<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.570> what

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
of clubs on the top of the deck and what

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.200 
of clubs on the top of the deck and what
we'll<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.800> we're<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:06.980> going<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.310> like

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
we'll do is we're just going to like

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.490 
we'll do is we're just going to like
this<00:02:08.330> we're<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.720> put<00:02:08.840> two<00:02:09.290> on<00:02:09.320> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
this we're going to put two on the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.950 
this we're going to put two on the
bottom<00:02:09.740> like<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:10.120> again

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.030 

and<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.940> time<00:02:16.150> actually<00:02:16.390> we'll<00:02:17.080> put<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.410> like

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and this time actually we'll put it like

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.650 
and this time actually we'll put it like
that<00:02:18.070> so<00:02:18.700> basically<00:02:19.060> you're<00:02:19.240> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.600> it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that so basically you're going to do it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.210 
that so basically you're going to do it
four<00:02:19.900> times<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.320> bottom<00:02:20.530> one<00:02:20.740> two<00:02:20.920> three

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
four times on the bottom one two three

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.310 
four times on the bottom one two three
four<00:02:21.460> on<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> bottom<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.150> then<00:02:22.930> one<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
four on the bottom and then one on the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.230 
four on the bottom and then one on the
top<00:02:23.470> remember<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.130> pick<00:02:24.250> up<00:02:24.370> two<00:02:24.610> cards<00:02:24.940> so

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
top remember you pick up two cards so

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.060 
top remember you pick up two cards so
one<00:02:25.600> from<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> top<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.260> bottom<00:02:26.380> each

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
one from the top and the bottom each

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.450 
one from the top and the bottom each
time<00:02:27.370> all<00:02:28.330> right<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.950> after<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.370> you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
time all right so after you that you

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.860 
time all right so after you that you
show<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.700> spectator<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> King<00:02:31.600> hearts

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
show the spectator that the King hearts

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.900 
show the spectator that the King hearts
that's<00:02:32.740> not<00:02:32.980> their<00:02:33.100> car<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.580> just<00:02:33.700> leave

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
that's not their car and you just leave

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.030 
that's not their car and you just leave
it<00:02:34.000> face<00:02:34.180> down<00:02:34.210> like<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.020> he<00:02:35.590> also<00:02:35.740> shown

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
it face down like that and he also shown

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.950 
it face down like that and he also shown
that<00:02:36.330> whatever<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.420> next<00:02:37.510> are<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.720> ten<00:02:37.930> of

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
that whatever the next are the ten of

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.200 
that whatever the next are the ten of
spades<00:02:38.050> but<00:02:38.980> that's<00:02:39.130> another<00:02:39.520> part<00:02:39.790> either<00:02:39.910> so

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
spades but that's another part either so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.300 
spades but that's another part either so
you<00:02:40.270> have<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> facedown<00:02:40.710> now<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.040> move

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you have a facedown now this is the move

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.280 
you have a facedown now this is the move
that<00:02:42.610> makes<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.240> trick<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.840> show<00:02:44.170> them

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
that makes the trick is to show them

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.540 
that makes the trick is to show them
that<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> jack<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.890> spades<00:02:44.920> or<00:02:45.160> whatever<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
that the jack of spades or whatever the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.160 
that the jack of spades or whatever the
third<00:02:45.730> card<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.060> that's<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.930> but<00:02:46.960> what

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
third card is that's not it but what

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.940 
third card is that's not it but what
you're<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> do<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.710> we're<00:02:47.800> going<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
you're going to do is we're going to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
you're going to do is we're going to
slide<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.220> off<00:02:48.490> like<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.870> see<00:02:49.900> now<00:02:50.110> that

slide it off like this you see now that

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.420 
slide it off like this you see now that
move<00:02:50.560> works<00:02:50.770> we're<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.040> going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.190> slide<00:02:51.400> it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
move works we're just going to slide it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.700 
move works we're just going to slide it
off<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.300> then<00:02:52.360> take<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.960> card<00:02:53.170> underneath<00:02:53.410> it

facedown all right so after that window

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.030 
facedown all right so after that window
is<00:03:10.080> sure<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> spectra<00:03:11.560> ger<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> only
