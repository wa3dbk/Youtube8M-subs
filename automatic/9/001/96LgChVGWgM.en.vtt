00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.450 

all<00:02:24.200> right<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.680> it's<00:02:24.920> kind<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.250> we're

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
all right so it's kind of like we're

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.979 
all right so it's kind of like we're
doing<00:02:25.550> 3rd<00:02:26.120> fret<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.540> string

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.809 

and<00:02:29.170> going<00:02:29.739> back<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.099> forth<00:02:30.280> between<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.579> a

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
and going back and forth between that a

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.830 
and going back and forth between that a
and<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.090> D<00:02:31.239> string<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.569> it's<00:02:33.719> even<00:02:34.719> either

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and that D string so it's even either

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.539 
and that D string so it's even either
lift<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.109> finger<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:35.829> I'm<00:02:36.099> sure<00:02:36.280> ski<00:02:36.459> be

string 3rd fret to the hoopin a then we

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.449 
string 3rd fret to the hoopin a then we
go<00:02:46.389> up<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.719> the<00:02:46.840> octave<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.590> that's<00:02:48.219> really

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
go up to the octave and that's really

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.539 
go up to the octave and that's really
fast<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.969> goes<00:02:49.090> right<00:02:49.389> into<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.870> shuffling<00:02:53.549> ok

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
fast it goes right into the shuffling ok

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:10.589 
fast it goes right into the shuffling ok
so<00:02:54.609> all<00:02:54.969> in<00:02:55.120> all<00:02:55.209> we<00:02:55.359> have
