actually<00:04:03.760> get<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.269> cut<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.079> coop<00:04:05.500> coop<00:04:05.860> er<00:04:06.040> I

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
actually get it to cut a coop coop er I

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.009 
actually get it to cut a coop coop er I
was<00:04:06.400> praising<00:04:06.910> your<00:04:07.060> car<00:04:07.180> was<00:04:07.390> praising<00:04:07.840> yes

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
was praising your car was praising yes

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.960 
was praising your car was praising yes
so<00:04:08.470> yeah<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:08.890> use<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.250> throttle<00:04:09.760> right

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
so yeah if you use the throttle right

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.690 
so yeah if you use the throttle right
and<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.780> amount<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.110> turning<00:04:11.650> angle<00:04:11.799> you<00:04:12.400> put

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
and the amount of turning angle you put

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.060 
and the amount of turning angle you put
on<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.120> corners<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.720> can<00:04:14.440> actually<00:04:14.650> get

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
on in the corners you can actually get

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.420 
on in the corners you can actually get
this<00:04:15.250> thing<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.670> go<00:04:15.820> pretty<00:04:16.299> well<00:04:17.280> see<00:04:18.280> what<00:04:18.400> I

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
this thing to go pretty well see what I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.400 
this thing to go pretty well see what I
mean<00:04:18.640> like<00:04:18.820> it's<00:04:19.000> not<00:04:19.150> sliding<00:04:19.630> too<00:04:20.049> much<00:04:20.229> it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
mean like it's not sliding too much it's

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.320 
mean like it's not sliding too much it's
staying<00:04:20.680> in<00:04:20.919> control<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.459> Ghostlight<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.180> a

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
staying in control the Ghostlight it's a

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.710 
staying in control the Ghostlight it's a
controlled<00:04:23.080> slide<00:04:24.120> which<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.150> always<00:04:25.539> the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
controlled slide which is always the

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.600 
controlled slide which is always the
best<00:04:25.900> slide<00:04:26.320> otherwise<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.160> just<00:04:27.460> out<00:04:27.580> of

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
best slide otherwise you just out of

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.080 
best slide otherwise you just out of
control<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.240> then<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.450> die<00:04:28.680> brought<00:04:30.090> it's

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
control and then you die brought it's

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.260 
control and then you die brought it's
pretty<00:04:31.599> that<00:04:31.780> I'm<00:04:31.870> good<00:04:32.220> I'm<00:04:33.220> actually<00:04:33.430> want

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
pretty that I'm good I'm actually want

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.450 
pretty that I'm good I'm actually want
to<00:04:34.419> get<00:04:34.570> really<00:04:34.900> impressive<00:04:35.349> what<00:04:35.950> I've<00:04:36.070> also

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
to get really impressive what I've also

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.430 
to get really impressive what I've also
found<00:04:36.729> what<00:04:37.210> I'm<00:04:37.330> finding<00:04:37.539> annoying<00:04:38.020> now<00:04:38.200> is

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
found what I'm finding annoying now is

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.290 
found what I'm finding annoying now is
I'm<00:04:38.710> now<00:04:38.950> exploring<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.789> cars<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.270> I

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
I'm now exploring the cars that I

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.270 
I'm now exploring the cars that I
wouldn't<00:04:40.599> necessarily<00:04:40.750> pick<00:04:41.289> up<00:04:41.440> first<00:04:41.830> which

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
wouldn't necessarily pick up first which

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.730 
wouldn't necessarily pick up first which
I<00:04:42.430> should<00:04:42.820> off<00:04:42.970> because<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.690> didn't<00:04:44.470> want<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.650> go

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
I should off because I didn't want to go

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.500 
I should off because I didn't want to go
here<00:04:44.950> because<00:04:45.220> these<00:04:45.520> cars<00:04:45.849> are<00:04:46.030> ending<00:04:46.419> up

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
here because these cars are ending up

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.839 
here because these cars are ending up
being<00:04:46.930> better<00:04:47.200> than<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.590> cars<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.099> really<00:04:48.610> much

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
being better than the cars I really much

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.500 
being better than the cars I really much
would<00:04:49.599> prefer<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.229> go<00:04:50.410> with<00:04:50.440> at<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.860> beginning

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
would prefer to go with at the beginning

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.980 
would prefer to go with at the beginning
it's<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.930> heavy<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:55.330> American

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
it's a heavy it's American

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.700 
it's a heavy it's American
it's<00:04:56.590> very<00:04:57.190> fast<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.880> takes<00:04:58.180> corners<00:04:58.840> unlike<00:04:59.680> a

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
it's very fast it takes corners unlike a

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.960 
it's very fast it takes corners unlike a
lot<00:04:59.979> of<00:05:00.010> American<00:05:00.789> cars<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.820> don't<00:05:03.820> know

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
lot of American cars so I don't know

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.180 
lot of American cars so I don't know
it's<00:05:04.270> it's<00:05:04.570> pretty<00:05:04.930> good<00:05:05.110> actually<00:05:05.349> I'm<00:05:05.710> quite

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
it's it's pretty good actually I'm quite

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.620 
it's it's pretty good actually I'm quite
impressed<00:05:06.310> when<00:05:06.729> quite<00:05:06.880> shift<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.479> this

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
impressed when quite shift with this

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.900 
impressed when quite shift with this
look<00:05:07.840> at<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.320> think<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:08.890> dirt<00:05:09.220> spec<00:05:09.669> this

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
look at it I think in dirt spec this

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.180 
look at it I think in dirt spec this
would<00:05:10.090> be<00:05:10.210> absolutely<00:05:10.630> incredible<00:05:10.720> I'm<00:05:11.409> not

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
would be absolutely incredible I'm not

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.210 
would be absolutely incredible I'm not
too<00:05:12.700> sure<00:05:12.940> you<00:05:13.120> can<00:05:13.390> get<00:05:13.599> it<00:05:13.690> in<00:05:13.780> Burt<00:05:13.930> spec<00:05:14.289> so

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
too sure you can get it in Burt spec so

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.460 
too sure you can get it in Burt spec so
that's<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.580> bit<00:05:15.729> of<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.940> shame<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.930> there<00:05:17.320> is<00:05:17.440> a

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
that's a bit of a shame but there is a

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.200 
that's a bit of a shame but there is a
way<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.740> drift<00:05:18.130> perf<00:05:18.370> although<00:05:18.849> it's<00:05:19.000> not

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
way to drift perf although it's not

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.080 
way to drift perf although it's not
ideal<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:20.080> me<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.530> doesn't<00:05:21.250> feel<00:05:21.400> right<00:05:21.820> in<00:05:21.940> any

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
ideal to me it doesn't feel right in any

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.560 
ideal to me it doesn't feel right in any
way<00:05:22.360> whatsoever<00:05:24.000> for<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.060> little<00:05:25.270> bit<00:05:25.390> of<00:05:25.479> like

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
way whatsoever for a little bit of like

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.600 
way whatsoever for a little bit of like
to<00:05:25.690> drift<00:05:25.930> /<00:05:26.140> I<00:05:26.380> think<00:05:26.710> if<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:26.890> do<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.130> the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
to drift / I think if you do the the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.029 
to drift / I think if you do the the
tuning<00:05:28.360> right<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.840> put<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.260> know<00:05:29.380> crap<00:05:29.770> tires

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
tuning right and put you know crap tires

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.800 
tuning right and put you know crap tires
on<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.400> sort<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:30.580> stuff<00:05:30.789> this<00:05:31.390> thing<00:05:31.659> would

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
on that sort of stuff this thing would

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.170 
on that sort of stuff this thing would
handle<00:05:32.110> pretty<00:05:32.650> damn<00:05:33.099> nice<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.849> I<00:05:33.909> don't<00:05:33.940> want

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
handle pretty damn nice and I don't want

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.000
