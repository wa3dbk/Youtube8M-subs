is<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.549> cartilage<00:02:07.549> that<00:02:08.420> needs<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.049> be<00:02:09.080> cut<00:02:09.500> just

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
is a cartilage that needs to be cut just

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.360 
is a cartilage that needs to be cut just
below<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.280> skin<00:02:10.580> if<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.239> try<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> remove<00:02:11.750> this

from the cartilage it'll probably tear

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.320 
from the cartilage it'll probably tear
so<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.769> best<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.220> leave<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.549> small<00:02:16.000> amount<00:02:16.209> of
