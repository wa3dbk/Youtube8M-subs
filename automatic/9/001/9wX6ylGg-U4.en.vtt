00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.309 
this just because it does not come in my
color<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.940> pretty<00:02:23.300> sure<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.110> comes

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
color but I'm pretty sure that it comes

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.690 
color but I'm pretty sure that it comes
in<00:02:24.650> your<00:02:24.920> color<00:02:25.220> um

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
in your color um

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.020 
in your color um
which<00:02:26.630> would<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.840> three<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.790> little

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
which would be three this is a little

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.190 
which would be three this is a little
bit<00:02:29.120> too<00:02:29.239> dark<00:02:29.480> for<00:02:29.570> me<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.959> little<00:02:30.050> bit

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
bit too dark for me it's a little bit

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.690 
bit too dark for me it's a little bit
too<00:02:30.410> light<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.620> me<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.100> think<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.489> this

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
too light for me but I think that this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.970 
too light for me but I think that this
will<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.239> perfect<00:02:32.510> color<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.260> um<00:02:33.500> and

product so I don't personally use it but
you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.100> see<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.400> kind<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.670> blends<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.180> my

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.150 
you can see it kind of blends in with my
skin<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.930> your<00:03:09.290> skin<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.680> probably<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:10.070> little

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
skin and your skin is probably a little

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.400 
skin and your skin is probably a little
bit<00:03:10.400> lighter<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.880> definitely<00:03:11.480> lighter<00:03:12.110> than
