00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.080
 I hope you are great today we are going to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.299
 talk about a trend that is the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 school style trend is a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.330
 trend that we have seen a lot but 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.070
 yes it is true that for this fall 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.719
 has a small tourist as well as before 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 we have seen a tendency to collegiate with 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.230
 a more innocent style a little prep and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.820
 such right now this same trend 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340
 evolve a little more with a touch 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 more rebellious to make these looks 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 inspired me in a collection that is the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 of square that I love you puts it on 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.330
 also on the blog for you to see and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.740
 these looks in general serve either 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.029
 for girls who are going to the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.410
 university that you like to see 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 feel like that with a little touch 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.280
 university or for people who are not 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 university but you want to give it a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.329
 College touch to their looks these three 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.710
 I'm going to show you what I'm going to do 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.480
 with jeans that is a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.190
 basic that surely all of you have in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.780
 the closet then the twist that you 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.120
 let's give those pants is that the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
 let's roll up the bottom 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.960
 the type of pants that I wear as you see 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.640
 it's not a totally skinny pants is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 pretty tight but yes that's true 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.360
 that in the part of down here has a 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.710
 little bit of space to be able to 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.570
 what we are going to do is simply 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.420
 keep circling and creating a 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.800
 hem on the pants until you get 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.500
 more or less up to half of the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.010
 calf we do the same with the other 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.990
 leg 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.700
 We will create the following effect with 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 a finite belt as you see this one 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.940
 chosen in brown tones simply what 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.680
 let's go through the buckles of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.030
 pants and that's how we're going to stay 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.400
 the pants for the rest of the three 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.470
 looks to build the first look 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.350
 do with a shirt or denim or 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.060
 well the classic light blue shirt that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 It is very easy to count on any 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.720
 shop those shirts that are very classic 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 let's try to give them a more 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 updated below with above 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.330
 we put on a sweater that you have 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.590
 gray color you know that the blue and the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.420
 juli are the colors as very 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.800
 students in this case I did a 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.660
 Jersey I had at home that sounds 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.430
 that has more things not like almost flat 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.140
 gray sweatshirt type or classic type of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.729
 icon in the case of this jersey and the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.680
 tap of the tails is the one that gives you that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 touch more student the next step 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.710
 that you have to give this seems like a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.630
 class as of dunces truth you can put 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.320
 in the shirt the sweater inside the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.820
 trousers 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.450
 so you are seeing how the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.450
 result 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.220
 to finish the look as it is 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.660
 beginning to make more cool the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.400
 we add an American in one color 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.140
 rabid and there is the touch of color that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.970
 gives disquera to all its styles not that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.010
 always add a tonality like that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.020
 little bit more vibrant as accessories a 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.820
 Classic bowling bag and some 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:37.260
 lounge shoes with a little heel 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:38.489
 sharp for the second the looks like 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.320
 You see we take back the same pants 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.000
 Jeans of the first look and in the part 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.530
 from above a white shirt sure 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.060
 you have any white shirt at home 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.380
 It helps you to make this look in the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.000
 part of here time and you know that 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.130
 This type of looks invites a lot to the use 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.840
 of bow ties and if you think 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.340
 I am very exaggerated what I suggest 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.110
 is that simply here in the part of 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.480
 the final button, let's say the shirt 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.010
 you put a brooch and already to give the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.720
 final touch to the look I have added a 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.910
 vest if you think it's too exaggerated 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.620
 of paintings that I love to join it to 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.590
 collegiate theme you can choose a vest 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.060
 make it smooth as I have not added a bag 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.710
 of sachs style you already know that you are 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.170
 bags are also very associated with 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.790
 type of image that we want to create and for 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.440
 finish the shoes you can choose the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.990
 same as we had before to give them the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.670
 rebel touch of student girl with 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.290
 heel and for those who prefer the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.880
 comfort first of all I suggest these 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.500
 dancers in the color of season as 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.500
 It's the wine that goes great with the look 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.950
 for the third and last of the looks 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.390
 how you cheated and I change the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.880
 belt but good is the same style 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.440
 of the central belt thin but this 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.480
 case I have decided to change it for a color 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.310
 red to give that touch of color to 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.350
 finish it you can add a piece of 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.030
 stylish coat with its promilitar that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.920
 to 6 that comes a lot and good today not 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.870
 I'm going to put bag or suitcase or sanchez and 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:04.980
 nothing because I'm dowry that I 'm going to do 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:06.330
 borroto and I will not go to class either 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.680
 we have arrived with this video that I have 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.210
 given ideas on how you can give the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.890
 secto that will collect our looks but 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.480
 an updated commercial touch I hope 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.560

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.560
