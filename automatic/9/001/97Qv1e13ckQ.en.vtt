house Cecily fail at pack mania so look

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.719 
house Cecily fail at pack mania so look
forward<00:06:44.590> to<00:06:44.740> that<00:06:44.830> in<00:06:44.949> the<00:06:45.039> next<00:06:45.099> few<00:06:45.580> days

forward to that in the next few days

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.150 
forward to that in the next few days
most<00:06:46.240> likely<00:06:46.570> so<00:06:47.410> that<00:06:47.530> was<00:06:47.620> how<00:06:47.710> successfully

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
most likely so that was how successfully

all<00:06:50.699> 20<00:06:51.699> minutes<00:06:52.030> of<00:06:52.210> that<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:53.530> I'll<00:06:53.919> to

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
all 20 minutes of that and I'll to

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.790 
all 20 minutes of that and I'll to
levels<00:06:54.639> but<00:06:54.910> that's<00:06:55.210> how<00:06:55.300> it<00:06:55.419> goes<00:06:55.449> I<00:06:55.599> guess

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
levels but that's how it goes I guess
