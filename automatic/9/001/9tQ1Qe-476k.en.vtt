00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:10.633
 Our body consists of 50 trillion cells. These cells are very different from each other; it has different functions, but, almost all of the cells 

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:17.533
 common point is that all of them have a core and mitochonite 

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:26.966
 This includes 99.9% of our core genes, and there are several more genes in mitochondria. According to known 

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:33.266
 we have almost 20,000 genes. Our genes, deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:39.566
 is a small molecule called DNA. 

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:45.732
 If you listed all the DNA that carries all your genes side by side 

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:55.366
 They'd be six feet, 180cm long. but these DNAs are wrapped very tightly in a single core. 

00:00:55.366 --> 00:01:05.032
 they fit into. DNA; It is a double stranded molecule consisting of sugar, phosphate and four different bases. 

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:08.433
 These 4 bases are: adenine thymine 

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:15.566
 cytosine and guanine. These bases make up our genetic code. 

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:22.699
 Is the number and order of these four bases, a chimpanzee, a cow, a banana? 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.533
 or we will be a human being. In most genes, there are recipes for producing some specific proteins, and this is described 

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:37.466
 from parents to children, from a generation to the next generation. 

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:43.866
 If someone says: "You took your father's hair." 

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:50.166
 "Apparently, the hair that your gene from genes or genes produce from the father instructs 

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:56.499
 root cells have made your hair like your father's. " 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.266
 But of course they prefer to use the short version. 

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:09.299
 Genes tell how a cell functions and what features it should expose. And especially the gene 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.366
 To control cell functions of genes in different cells, 

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:21.999
 It also acts as a function by activating or disabling it. Bearing our genes 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.633
 Large molecules of DNA are divided into parts called chromosomes. 

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:35.299
 Different species have different numbers of chromosomes. People are usually 23 "double" 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.000
 46 chromosomes. 24 pair of chimpanzees 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.133
 21 pairs of Resus monkeys 

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:52.833
 30 pairs of cows, 39 pairs of chickens, 4 pairs of circuses 

00:02:52.833 --> 00:03:03.033
 and bananas are 11 pairs of chromosomes. Question: What percentage of DNA in our chromosomes do we share with other species? 

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:12.033
 We share 93% of our DNA with the Resus Monkey and 98.5% with our chimpanzee friend. Well 

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:21.033
 or how many people do you share? Answer: 99.5%. So what makes us different from each other? 

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.000
 Of course the SNPs we'll see in the next video.
