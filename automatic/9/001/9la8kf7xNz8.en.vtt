internet but I couldn't find anything so
I've<00:00:53.250> dedicated<00:00:53.489> myself<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:55.190> learning<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I've dedicated myself to learning a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.029 
I've dedicated myself to learning a
little<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.640> tuning<00:00:57.300> forks<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.680> just

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
little bit about tuning forks and I just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
little bit about tuning forks and I just
how<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> might<00:00:59.489> use<00:00:59.550> them<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.210> clear<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
how you might use them to clear the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
how you might use them to clear the
energy<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.100> body<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:03.030> know

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
energy from your body you know

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.730 
energy from your body you know
relaxation<00:01:05.900> whatever<00:01:06.900> work<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
relaxation whatever work for you so I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.270 
relaxation whatever work for you so I
just<00:01:10.830> thought<00:01:11.220> I'd<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:13.400> intro<00:01:14.400> video

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
just thought I'd do a little intro video

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
just thought I'd do a little intro video
into<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> next<00:01:17.670> video<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.479> hoping<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
into the next video I'm really hoping to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
into the next video I'm really hoping to
do<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.159> later<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.580> today

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.500 

so<00:01:27.460> we'll<00:01:27.610> have<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.330> this<00:01:28.570> little<00:01:28.870> chin<00:01:29.290> for

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
so we'll have it is this little chin for

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:55.820 
so we'll have it is this little chin for
just<00:01:31.510> an<00:01:31.660> a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.740 

so<00:01:56.400> let's<00:01:56.550> just<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:57.030> myself<00:01:59.750> clearing

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so let's just think it myself clearing

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.980 
so let's just think it myself clearing
our<00:02:00.870> energy<00:02:03.860> listen<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.130> sound<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
our energy listen to the sound of the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.910 
our energy listen to the sound of the
tuning<00:02:07.350> fork<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:11.190> clears<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.790> energy<00:02:12.920> from

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
tuning fork as it clears the energy from

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:24.710 
tuning fork as it clears the energy from
your<00:02:14.070> head<00:02:16.340> close<00:02:17.340> your<00:02:17.580> eyes<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:19.680> relax<00:02:23.720> as

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
your head close your eyes just relax as

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.370
