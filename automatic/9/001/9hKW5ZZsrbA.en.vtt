00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
and then we're gonna use the cellular

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.359 
and then we're gonna use the cellular
okay<00:01:23.850> cellular<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:25.049> cellular<00:01:25.860> data<00:01:26.070> has

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
okay cellular and then cellular data has

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.749 
okay cellular and then cellular data has
to<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.040> read<00:01:29.310> again

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to be on if you know it's not read again

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.450 
to be on if you know it's not read again
I<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> slide<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> on

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I mean and then you have to slide it on

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.840 
I mean and then you have to slide it on
the<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.850> side<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.409> turn<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.130> data

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the right side to turn on and data

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
the right side to turn on and data
roaming<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:36.930> important<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
roaming it's very important that you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.700 
roaming it's very important that you
have<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.770> helps<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.250> LTE

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
have this on because that helps your LTE

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
have this on because that helps your LTE
data<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> work<00:01:45.090> properly<00:01:47.090> okay<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> third

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
data to work properly okay now the third

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.109 
data to work properly okay now the third
step<00:01:49.409> we're<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.680> use<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.460> cellular

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
step we're gonna use is the cellular

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.870 
step we're gonna use is the cellular
data<00:01:51.450> network<00:01:51.630> okay<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.890> step<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> one

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
data network okay this step is the one

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.480 
data network okay this step is the one
that<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> write<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> APNs<00:01:56.159> from

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that we want to write the APNs from

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
that we want to write the APNs from
simple<00:01:57.030> mobile<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:59.700> make<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> work<00:02:00.060> okay<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
simple mobile to to make it work okay so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.560 
simple mobile to to make it work okay so
the<00:02:02.070> first<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> cellular<00:02:02.939> data<00:02:03.149> APM<00:02:04.049> just

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
the first one is cellular data APM just
