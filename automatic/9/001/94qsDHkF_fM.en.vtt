00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
against we whisk or 19 or 20 calls and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
against we whisk or 19 or 20 calls and
we<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> consider<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.789> i<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> very

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
we just consider one so i think is very

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.729 
we just consider one so i think is very
important<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.399> do<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.910> win<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> kappa<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
important to do to win that kappa and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.670 
important to do to win that kappa and
also<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> way<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.210> played<00:01:03.530> you'll<00:01:04.530> be

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
also in the way we we played you'll be

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
also in the way we we played you'll be
seen<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.070> heavy<00:01:05.309> favorites<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.659> any

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
seen as heavy favorites is there any

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
seen as heavy favorites is there any
danger<00:01:07.140> review<00:01:07.619> under<00:01:07.920> estimating

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
danger review under estimating

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
danger review under estimating
Sunderland<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:10.010> of<00:01:11.010> course<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
Sunderland it's all of course it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
Sunderland it's all of course it's
always<00:01:11.549> dangerous<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.090> play<00:01:12.330> against<00:01:13.049> any

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
always dangerous to play against any

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
always dangerous to play against any
team<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.220> Sunderland<00:01:14.520> also<00:01:14.970> has<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
team I think that Sunderland also has a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
team I think that Sunderland also has a
lot<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> motivation<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.380> win<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> car

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
lot of motivation to win that car

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.690 
lot of motivation to win that car
basically<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.390> same<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:19.080> support<00:01:19.530> team<00:01:19.700> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
basically the same as a support team so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.320 
basically the same as a support team so
I<00:01:20.729> am<00:01:21.090> sure<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:22.549> maybe<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:24.119> are<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
I am sure that maybe we are the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.730 
I am sure that maybe we are the
favourites<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.640> cannot<00:01:26.909> forget<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.740> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
favourites but we cannot forget that so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.850 
favourites but we cannot forget that so
the<00:01:29.040> data<00:01:29.250> Sunderland<00:01:30.290> eliminated<00:01:31.290> Chelsea

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the data Sunderland eliminated Chelsea

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
the data Sunderland eliminated Chelsea
how<00:01:31.920> much<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> United<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:33.150> team<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:34.140> are

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
how much the United big team so they are

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.609 
how much the United big team so they are
in<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> final<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.220> deserve<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
in the final because they deserve so I

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.230 
in the final because they deserve so I
absolutely<00:01:37.619> sure<00:01:37.860> that'd<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> very<00:01:38.579> very

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
absolutely sure that'd be a very very

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.749 
absolutely sure that'd be a very very
close<00:01:39.450> game<00:01:39.619> they<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> added<00:01:41.520> pressure

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
close game they have the added pressure

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
close game they have the added pressure
in<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> lake<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:43.020> being<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> relegation

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
in the lake of being in the relegation

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460 
in the lake of being in the relegation
zone<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> different<00:01:46.079> kind

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
zone but for you is it a different kind

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
zone but for you is it a different kind
of<00:01:46.619> pressure<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.130> you're<00:01:48.119> close<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
of pressure because you're close to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.330 
of pressure because you're close to
maybe<00:01:48.810> winning<00:01:49.049> three<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.500> possibly<00:01:49.860> even<00:01:49.950> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
maybe winning three or possibly even for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
maybe winning three or possibly even for
trophies<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.909> season<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:51.450> well<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
trophies this season as well well I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
trophies this season as well well I
think<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.560> pressure<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> always<00:01:53.399> pondered<00:01:53.610> in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
think the pressure is always pondered in

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.359 
think the pressure is always pondered in
exactly<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> same<00:01:54.479> by<00:01:54.960> different<00:01:55.409> ways<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
exactly the same by different ways but

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.999 
exactly the same by different ways but
the<00:01:56.820> pressure<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:58.049> our<00:01:58.500> personal

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the pressure is is is our personal

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
the pressure is is is our personal
pressure<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.549> think<00:01:59.759> from<00:01:59.909> agile<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.689> managers

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
pressure I think from agile for managers

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
pressure I think from agile for managers
or<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:01.740> player<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.579> us<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.909> think

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
or from player for all of us I think

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
or from player for all of us I think

a<00:06:35.660> lesson<00:06:35.930> of<00:06:36.170> course<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:37.270> it's<00:06:38.270> very

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
a lesson of course to it's very

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.070

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
very awful to lose it so I think that

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.960 
very awful to lose it so I think that
all<00:06:44.750> of<00:06:44.780> them<00:06:45.100> is<00:06:46.100> not<00:06:46.340> a<00:06:46.370> rage<00:06:46.730> because

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
all of them is not a rage because

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.580 
all of them is not a rage because
another<00:06:47.390> team<00:06:47.690> another<00:06:48.050> year<00:06:48.290> another
