00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:05.575
 Now that I'm sleeping ... 

00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:09.345
 ... I pray to God to watch my soul. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.557
 If I should die before I wake up ... 

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.525
 ... I pray to God ... 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.158
 ... to take my soul. 

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:28.543
 No Please! 

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:36.324
 What happened? 

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:39.566
 RELATIVITY MEDIA ROGUE 

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:44.310
 My name is Adam Hellerman, but they all call me Bug. 

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:46.421
 I live in Riverton, Massachusetts. 

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:50.125
 It is a small town known for fishing, tourism and the Riverton ripper. 

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.192
 Today it's sixteen years since the Ripper was killed. 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.881
 The night seven of us were born. 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.950
 Some say we share more than just the same day of birth. 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.547
 They found Chang in the river this morning. 

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:07.683
 Is dead. 

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:10.183
 Pray for our souls, Bug. He is coming. 

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:11.327
 Hello? 

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:14.213
 We have no idea who could be the killer. 

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:15.682
 If he was bad enough? 

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:17.505
 Some think they got up from the grave. 

00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:19.258
 His soul lives on. 

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:22.249
 - You think the Ripper ... - ... has come back to get revenge. 

00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:27.084
 What if his soul is in one of seven children born on the day he died? 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.685
 - Bug? - Pray for our souls, Bug. 

00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:32.545
 In which? 

00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:35.230
 You know who your father was? 

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:38.899
 Look in the mirror, Bug. 

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.788
 You killed people, Bug? 

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:49.280
 Nothing to remember. 

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:51.628
 WES CRAVEN, DIRECTOR OF THE NIGHT MEANS FROM ELM STREET
