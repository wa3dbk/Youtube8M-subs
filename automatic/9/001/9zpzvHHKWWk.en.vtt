and honestly it's never let that go it's
been<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> segment<00:00:22.710> leader<00:00:22.859> since<00:00:23.189> then<00:00:23.460> and

been the segment leader since then and
even<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.449> its<00:00:24.600> last<00:00:24.869> year<00:00:25.230> being<00:00:25.470> an<00:00:25.619> old

vehicles like the Sorento and on the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.049 
vehicles like the Sorento and on the
Santa<00:00:31.140> Fe<00:00:31.260> sport<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.890> still<00:00:32.250> led<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> segment

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
Santa Fe sport it still led the segment

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.870 
Santa Fe sport it still led the segment
so<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.840> lot<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.440> riding<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> they

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so a lot was riding on this and they

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
so a lot was riding on this and they
really<00:00:36.210> delivered<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.350> where<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.680> really

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
really delivered but where they really

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
really delivered but where they really
came<00:00:38.160> through<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.579> what's<00:00:38.790> under<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> hood<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
came through is what's under the hood a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.190 
came through is what's under the hood a
lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.379> power<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.070> much<00:00:41.129> power<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
lot of power so much power it can get to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
lot of power so much power it can get to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

liter<00:01:24.540> EcoBoost<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> same<00:01:26.100> variation

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
liter EcoBoost it's the same variation

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539

of the 2.7 EcoBoost that's in the f-150
so<00:01:29.909> imagine<00:01:30.360> something<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> could<00:01:31.140> propel<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.670 

Ford<00:01:38.280> put<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.580> lot<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> emphasis<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.680> upgrading

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
saw these shiny cheap plastic pieces in

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.640 
saw these shiny cheap plastic pieces in
the<00:01:47.310> outgoing<00:01:47.460> model<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:48.930> much

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
the outgoing model you see these much

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.219

describes the edge as more of an
emotional<00:01:54.570> purchase<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.740> most<00:01:56.250> families

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
emotional purchase because most families

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.330 
emotional purchase because most families
shopping<00:01:57.690> for<00:01:57.810> crossovers<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.100> Ford

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
shopping for crossovers in a Ford

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.760 
shopping for crossovers in a Ford
dealership<00:01:59.759> will<00:02:00.000> either<00:02:00.270> opt<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
dealership will either opt for the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.030 
dealership will either opt for the
Explorer<00:02:02.759> which<00:02:03.299> will<00:02:03.509> seat<00:02:03.780> seven<00:02:04.470> people<00:02:04.830> or

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
Explorer which will seat seven people or

Explorer which will seat seven people or
the<00:02:05.909> escape<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.320> kind<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> sits<00:02:07.740> nicely

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the escape so this kind of sits nicely

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.669 
the escape so this kind of sits nicely
between<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> only<00:02:09.119> seats<00:02:09.450> five<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:10.320> so

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
between but it only seats five people so

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.890 
between but it only seats five people so
it<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.519> not<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.209> much<00:02:12.360> designed<00:02:12.750> for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it really is not so much designed for

use<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.350> edge<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.650> bigger<00:02:16.890> than<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.190> think

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
use it the edge is bigger than you think

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.220 
use it the edge is bigger than you think
when<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.150> inside<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.690> notice<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.110> how

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
when you get inside you notice just how

a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:33.930> bit<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.230> where<00:02:34.950> their

a little bit is where their

they make a lot of sense they're lighter

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.610 
they make a lot of sense they're lighter
the<00:02:40.769> more<00:02:40.920> compact<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:42.049> when<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.170> really<00:02:43.320> get

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the more compact but when you really get

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.809 
the more compact but when you really get
on<00:02:43.650> them

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.580 

your<00:02:47.359> fuel<00:02:47.629> economy<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:48.109> going<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.349> suffer

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
your fuel economy is going to suffer

back<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.790> interior<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.270> think<00:02:52.629> Ford<00:02:52.959> has

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
back to the interior I think Ford has

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
back to the interior I think Ford has
done<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.430> great<00:02:55.090> job<00:02:55.180> with<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.750> gauges<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.470> you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
done a great job with the gauges so you

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.770 
done a great job with the gauges so you
just<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> speedometer<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:58.330> if<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.540> want

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
just have a speedometer but if you want

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.130 
just have a speedometer but if you want
you<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.709> digital<00:03:00.310> tachometer<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.480> to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
you have a digital tachometer the to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.750 
you have a digital tachometer the to
both<00:03:02.379> sides<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.750> instrument<00:03:04.750> cluster<00:03:05.200> are

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
both sides of the instrument cluster are

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.009 
both sides of the instrument cluster are
customizable<00:03:06.760> depending<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.720> what

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
customizable depending on what

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.509 
customizable depending on what
information<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.769> want<00:03:08.800> whether<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.430> your

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
more upscale in the market and they've

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.259 
more upscale in the market and they've
done<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.100> with<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.250> lot<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.489> acoustic<00:04:16.030> glass

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
done that with a lot of acoustic glass

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.229 
done that with a lot of acoustic glass
and<00:04:17.070> added<00:04:18.070> insulation<00:04:18.519> throughout<00:04:18.970> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
and added insulation throughout the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.320 
and added insulation throughout the
vehicle<00:04:19.419> they<00:04:19.870> really<00:04:20.680> focused<00:04:21.220> on<00:04:21.459> what<00:04:22.210> they

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
vehicle they really focused on what they

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.080 
vehicle they really focused on what they
call<00:04:22.479> NVH<00:04:23.020> which<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.560> noise<00:04:24.190> vibration<00:04:25.000> and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
call NVH which is noise vibration and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.480 
call NVH which is noise vibration and
harshness<00:04:25.800> there's<00:04:26.800> some<00:04:26.919> new<00:04:27.039> parking

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
harshness there's some new parking

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.730 
harshness there's some new parking
technology<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.539> really<00:04:29.320> cool<00:04:29.530> we've

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
technology that is really cool we've

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.129 
technology that is really cool we've
seen<00:04:30.039> parallel<00:04:30.520> parking<00:04:31.000> technology<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:32.020> now

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
seen parallel parking technology but now

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.600 
seen parallel parking technology but now
they<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.500> perpendicular<00:04:33.340> parking

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
they have perpendicular parking

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.520 
they have perpendicular parking
technology<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.750> way<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.930> works<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.320> you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
technology so the way it works is you

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.310 
technology so the way it works is you
you're<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.520> parking<00:04:36.880> lot<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.630> see<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> space

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
you're in a parking lot you see a space

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.219 
you're in a parking lot you see a space
you<00:04:38.860> pull<00:04:39.070> ahead<00:04:39.360> activate<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.539> and<00:04:40.720> it'll

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
you pull ahead activate it and it'll

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.360 
you pull ahead activate it and it'll
back

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370

a package that costs almost six thousand

technology<00:05:00.940> which<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.270> shame<00:05:01.510> because<00:05:01.800> I've

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
technology which is a shame because I've

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.219 
technology which is a shame because I've
seen<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.160> way<00:05:03.250> people<00:05:03.280> park<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.120> they<00:05:05.050> could

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
seen the way people park and they could

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.490 
seen the way people park and they could
use<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.530> assistance<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:07.630> edge<00:05:07.750> has<00:05:08.139> a<00:05:08.169> lot<00:05:08.470> of

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
use the assistance the edge has a lot of

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.400 
use the assistance the edge has a lot of
technology<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.490> including<00:05:10.180> new<00:05:10.900> cameras

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410

in the front and rear which have 180
degree<00:05:14.740> angle<00:05:14.949> so<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.400> really<00:05:15.970> get<00:05:16.180> a

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449

in<00:05:36.220> your<00:05:36.280> pocket<00:05:36.490> but<00:05:37.300> overall<00:05:37.780> looking<00:05:38.139> at

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
in your pocket but overall looking at

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.930 
in your pocket but overall looking at
the<00:05:38.470> mainstream<00:05:39.070> edge<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.520> think<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:39.820> going

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
the mainstream edge I think it's going

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.029 
the mainstream edge I think it's going
to<00:05:40.000> continue<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.539> do<00:05:40.660> very<00:05:40.690> well<00:05:41.020> for<00:05:41.199> Ford<00:05:41.650> so

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
to continue to do very well for Ford so

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.200 
to continue to do very well for Ford so
if<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.190> looking<00:05:42.400> for<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.610> five-passenger
