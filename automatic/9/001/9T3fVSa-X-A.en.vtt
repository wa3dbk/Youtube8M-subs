00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.880
 well here we are with the teacher 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.490
 carolina normal hi 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.090
 good morning clear good is fine 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.640
 perfect very well glad a lot beautiful 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.940
 the bag dresses the cute that double 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 God so well glad the color well 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.390
 happy for summer suffered with zinc 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.370
 yes a nice technique to apply in a 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.370
 lots of things and apart to load them 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.640
 quite comfortable 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.710
 well we hear you thanks normal 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.899
 good is the technique that we are going to use today 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.970
 to make the covers of the bag is called 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.329
 water color which is a technique that 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.550
 uses and works in this way 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.760
 let's first work on a 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.760
 fiselina to paste on one side and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 let's draw a grid of squares 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.210
 in on the part that is rough it is the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.640
 part that has the glue and on the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.280
 fidelina we will distribute our 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.369
 squares the way we are most 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.320
 obviously like our squares and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.170
 the grid of fidelina have to 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.080
 match in size so we can 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.630
 after knowing them this is a technique 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.990
 which is sometimes used to do jobs 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.990
 as in gradient with many little flowers and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 how is a job as very complex 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.289
 and great is the fiselina for 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.580
 to be able to pass them easier then one 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.550
 time we have the distribution 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.289
 what we like about all of all 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.759
 We are going to paste the squares with the 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.370
 iron so I always advise that 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.170
 when we are going to work with fidelina 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.600
 we do it on a surface that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.490
 then we can iron then a 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 Once we have distributed all the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.050
 squares if we like we are going to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.390
 iron and we will stay like this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.690
 see that we have all the squares 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.580
 well grabbed and with this we are going to go to 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.760
 the iron sew the iron to the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.450
 machine to sew we are going to double each 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.430
 one of our ranks because of the fold that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.040
 we are right on the line and that is the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.100
 Cut between the squares and let's 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.510
 sew well we put the foot of quarter 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.989
 inch 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.450
 and we're going to be working all first one 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.159
 row all the verticals 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.819
 I'm going to sew a little but I want 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.270
 show them several of the rows for 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.850
 see how we work 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.130
 let's bake until the end 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.170
 we cut there 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.810
 and once we have the first row 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.020
 we are going to lift and we are going to fold and 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.990
 let's sew the next row and so 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.819
 let's make each of the rows and 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.540
 we will be sewn 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.540
 this way all the rows in one 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.170
 meaning after this let's cut 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.980
 with scissors good good sharp tip 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.829
 in each of the divisions among 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.359
 small squares of cloth and we're going to go back to 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.250
 sewing this will allow us to be able to 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.689
 Orient the seams so that the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.280
 work we stayed flat and we stayed 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.760
 neat as we always want to be 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.060
 stay then let's work like that I'll 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.060
 to bend 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.420
 the seams one up and another 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.150
 down then I'll start 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.700
 I want to show you what's important 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.519
 as it is for the next one I always put 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.129
 toward the top down I 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.180
 accommodating one up one towards 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.110
 down 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.110
 now I show you 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.560
 come here we are staying one towards 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.680
 up one down when I go to 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.540
 sew the next row the one that I have 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.630
 down I'm going to leave it down and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.200
 I'm going to alternate the other up to 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.260
 that when I have everything after 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.460
 finished sewing I'm alternating a 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.080
 another I stayed the neat work we go to 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.090
 always knowing bits of a 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.750
 little to be able to orientate well 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.450
 the seams will be left of this 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.220
 way when we have everything cooked what 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.870
 We iron and we have all the 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.310
 Seams to one side is the same if 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.250
 iron to one side or the other 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.640
 but this way we have all the work well 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.360
 flat and well-timed with this as well 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.380
 let's work another fabric that is going to be 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.370
 the fabric of the lining wadding the patchwork and 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.370
 this we are going to fight it with these care 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.200
 and working we are going to build for 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.720
 to be able to assemble our bag and now if 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.310
 we go to the bag and I come here and I brought a cloth 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.130
 ready so you can see the 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.400
 armed bag we will build two 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.100
 covers exactly the same size one 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.890
 part for what is the base and two 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.620
 triangles for the lateral the triangle 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.390
 from the side what I do is draw in 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.700
 a role first so that it serves me as 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.840
 of mold according to the width that I wanted from 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.640
 base and the same height of my bag will 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.070
 I add the seam allowance and I can 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.620
 cut each piece on the canvas 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.650
 work on your side with prosecuted with 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.690
 the background fabric as you see here and we are going to 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.380
 start building let's start 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.620
 first it is very easy to assemble always 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.550
 putting right with right 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.130
 with another yes and we will join with sewing 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.260
 Straight always with the foot of quilting 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.860
 to make it easier for us and it's going to 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:45.729
 be united in this way but there 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.490
 that keep in mind this I'm going to sew not 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.740
 everything complete I will leave a little bit of 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.590
 margin to advice for this bag as 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.930
 we have all the fabric together to do 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.639
 a wider seam then we leave 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.139
 this room because this is what is going 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.300
 to allow me to put the 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.930
 sides I put back the right with 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.050
 right I sew from end to end and this 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.590
 opening is what allows me to be able 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.870
 do this that if not I could not sew it 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.780
 already with this we have practically 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.270
 armed the bag and we have only the 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.790
 part of the ending come here yo 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.770
 I have the bag already finished I have the 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.200
 sewing that after I will have to 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.910
 cover neatly for this is 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.970
 advisable told them the most 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:38.860
 wide here I have already armed my bag as 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.720
 it ended first a strip that is me 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.970
 I cut a strip of 3 inches or so 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.750
 that the iron moss along I'm going to 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.390
 place the whole thing on the back first 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.810
 around and once I have it cooked 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.360
 just there I will support the handles the 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.060
 handles are little long we support them the 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.120
 I present them and then I come with 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.400
 pulls it back to front and there the 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.950
 thing and so that I do not stay down 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.290
 I can turn it over and do one last 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.950
 seam up so that the handle is left 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:17.120
 well located in the beautiful 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:22.610
 easy and it was nice 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:25.610
