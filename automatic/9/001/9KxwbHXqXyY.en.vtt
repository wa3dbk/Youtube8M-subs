about 10-15 minutes I want to cut right
along<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.979> edges<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.869> open<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
along the edges so you can open up this

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.039 
along the edges so you can open up this
unit<00:01:41.479> same<00:01:42.479> thing<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> other<00:01:42.960> side

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.859 

and<00:01:48.170> you'll<00:01:48.289> see<00:01:48.469> that<00:01:48.619> both<00:01:48.950> sides<00:01:49.009> are<00:01:49.490> open

and you'll see that both sides are open

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.120 
and you'll see that both sides are open
now<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:50.929> this<00:01:51.049> particular<00:01:51.380> battery<00:01:51.740> gets<00:01:52.100> a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
now in this particular battery gets a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.380 
now in this particular battery gets a
little<00:01:52.219> confusing<00:01:52.640> because<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.090> color<00:01:53.299> of

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
little confusing because the color of

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.819 
little confusing because the color of
the<00:01:53.509> wires<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.020> how<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.200> want<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.469> hook<00:01:54.619> that

one

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
one

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.990 
one
so<00:01:55.759> you'll<00:01:56.630> notice<00:01:56.929> one<00:01:57.140> side<00:01:57.439> as<00:01:57.770> what<00:01:58.700> seems

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
so you'll notice one side as what seems

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.370 
so you'll notice one side as what seems
to<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.359> easy<00:01:59.600> access<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.909> other<00:02:02.000> side

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
to be easy access and on the other side

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.910 
to be easy access and on the other side
it's<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.530> much<00:02:03.740> tighter<00:02:04.250> fit<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.649> easiest

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
it's a much tighter fit so the easiest

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.669 
it's a much tighter fit so the easiest
way<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.130> do<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.060> kind<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.569> fold<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.560> in

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
way to do this is to kind of fold it in

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.539 
way to do this is to kind of fold it in
half<00:02:10.569> unplug<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.799> particular<00:02:13.160> side

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
half unplug it on this particular side

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.680 
half unplug it on this particular side
you'll<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.629> yellow<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:16.310> black<00:02:16.690> on

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
you'll have just a yellow and a black on

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.960 
you'll have just a yellow and a black on
the<00:02:17.870> battery<00:02:18.200> itself<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:19.250> yellow<00:02:19.700> was

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the battery itself that yellow was

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.729 
the battery itself that yellow was
connected<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.599> positive<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.319> black

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
connected to the positive and the black

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.440 
connected to the positive and the black
was<00:02:22.040> connected<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.640> negative<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
was connected to the negative the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.940 
was connected to the negative the
battery<00:02:23.750> itself<00:02:23.989> will<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.319> red<00:02:24.620> for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
battery itself will have red for

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.339 
battery itself will have red for
positive<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.610> black<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.510> negative<00:02:29.349> the

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
positive and black for negative the

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.350 
positive and black for negative the
other<00:02:30.410> battery<00:02:30.920> you'll<00:02:31.670> notice<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.180> much

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
other battery you'll notice it's a much

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.000 
other battery you'll notice it's a much
tighter<00:02:32.599> fit<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.260> little<00:02:33.500> harder<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.860> get

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
tighter fit it's a little harder to get

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.729 
tighter fit it's a little harder to get
at<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.720> reason<00:02:36.049> why<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.319> want<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.560> pull

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
at so the reason why we want to pull

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.800 
at so the reason why we want to pull
this<00:02:36.829> apart<00:02:36.980> first<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.030> then<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:38.269> can<00:02:38.420> start

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
this apart first so then we can start

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.869 
this apart first so then we can start
from<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.799> bottom<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.370> work<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> top<00:02:42.879> so

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
from the bottom and work to the top so

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.850 
from the bottom and work to the top so
those<00:02:44.030> are<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.239> two<00:02:44.390> batteries<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:45.500> need<00:02:45.739> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
those are the two batteries that need to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.490 
those are the two batteries that need to
be<00:02:45.950> replaced<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.900> your<00:02:48.079> shipment<00:02:48.440> you're

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
be replaced in your shipment you're

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.220 
be replaced in your shipment you're
going<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.709> have<00:02:48.829> two<00:02:49.129> new<00:02:49.340> batteries<00:02:50.049> it's<00:02:51.049> not

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
going to have two new batteries it's not

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.660 
going to have two new batteries it's not
always<00:02:51.410> apparent<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.950> everybody<00:02:52.130> but<00:02:52.519> there

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
always apparent to everybody but there

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.670 
always apparent to everybody but there
are<00:02:52.730> some<00:02:52.910> protectors<00:02:53.450> sitting<00:02:54.170> right<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.350> top

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
are some protectors sitting right on top

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.410 
are some protectors sitting right on top
you<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.190> pull<00:02:55.430> them<00:02:55.549> off<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.150> throw

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
you just pull them off you can throw

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.860 
you just pull them off you can throw
them<00:02:56.480> away<00:02:56.569> afterwards<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.450> typically

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
them away afterwards and I typically

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.199 
them away afterwards and I typically
like<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.139> use<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.650> side<00:03:00.829> that's<00:03:01.100> flat<00:03:01.400> not<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
like to use the side that's flat not the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.479 
like to use the side that's flat not the
side<00:03:02.450> that's<00:03:02.720> inside<00:03:03.139> where<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:04.010> wires<00:03:04.220> can

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
side that's inside where the wires can

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.599 
side that's inside where the wires can
be<00:03:04.609> moved<00:03:04.790> much<00:03:05.000> easier<00:03:05.359> to<00:03:05.900> start<00:03:06.139> with

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
be moved much easier to start with

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.680 
be moved much easier to start with
you'll<00:03:07.609> notice<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.090> don't<00:03:08.269> have<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> lot

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
you'll notice that you don't have a lot

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.009 
you'll notice that you don't have a lot
of<00:03:08.840> choice<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:10.310> only<00:03:10.459> fits<00:03:10.760> one<00:03:10.849> way<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.540> the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
of choice it only fits one way and the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.289 
of choice it only fits one way and the
leads<00:03:12.230> are<00:03:12.410> always<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.889> same<00:03:12.920> side<00:03:13.099> but<00:03:13.700> in

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
leads are always on the same side but in

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.030 
leads are always on the same side but in
this<00:03:14.420> particular<00:03:14.690> case<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.290> yellow<00:03:15.500> wire<00:03:15.769> is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
this particular case the yellow wire is

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.280 
this particular case the yellow wire is
actually<00:03:16.700> connecting<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.329> black<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:18.079> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
actually connecting to the black on the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.460 
actually connecting to the black on the
battery<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.760> red<00:03:20.389> and<00:03:20.980> yellow<00:03:21.980> wire

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
battery and the red and yellow wire

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.590 
battery and the red and yellow wire
is<00:03:23.560> actually<00:03:24.550> connecting<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.120> positive

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
is actually connecting to the positive

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.440 
is actually connecting to the positive
which<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.810> also<00:03:26.080> read<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.800> battery<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:28.360> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
which is also read on the battery so to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.030 
which is also read on the battery so to
start<00:03:28.870> with<00:03:29.580> I'll<00:03:30.580> connect<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.030> negative

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
start with I'll connect the negative

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.070 
start with I'll connect the negative
connect<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> positive<00:03:33.630> make<00:03:34.630> sure<00:03:34.810> there's<00:03:35.020> a

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
connect the positive make sure there's a

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.400 
connect the positive make sure there's a
tight<00:03:35.320> fit<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.000> kind<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.120> move<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.570> on<00:03:38.350> a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
tight fit and kind of move this on a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.250 
tight fit and kind of move this on a
plastic<00:03:39.280> piece<00:03:39.490> until<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.360> slides<00:03:40.660> into<00:03:41.050> a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
plastic piece until it slides into a

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.530 
plastic piece until it slides into a
place<00:03:41.650> where<00:03:41.980> your<00:03:42.160> your<00:03:42.760> even<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.360> rest

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
place where your your even with the rest

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.060 
place where your your even with the rest
of<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> battery<00:03:44.050> again<00:03:44.940> again<00:03:46.710> just<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:47.830> matter

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
of the battery again again just a matter

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.810 
of the battery again again just a matter
of<00:03:48.220> getting<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.820> wire<00:03:49.000> out<00:03:49.210> of<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.360> way<00:03:50.820> now

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
of getting the wire out of the way now

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.280 
of getting the wire out of the way now
once<00:03:52.390> you've<00:03:52.540> done<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.990> will<00:03:53.110> probably

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
once you've done this you will probably

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.570 
once you've done this you will probably
dislodged<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:54.040> little<00:03:54.250> bit<00:03:54.370> you'll<00:03:54.550> notice

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
dislodged a little bit you'll notice

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.090 
dislodged a little bit you'll notice
that<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.060> wires<00:03:55.300> go<00:03:55.690> around<00:03:56.050> these<00:03:56.290> little

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
that the wires go around these little

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.640 
that the wires go around these little
tubes<00:03:57.459> inside<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.390> system<00:03:58.780> just<00:03:59.230> get<00:03:59.500> them

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
tubes inside the system just get them

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.930 
tubes inside the system just get them
back<00:03:59.860> in<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.100> same<00:04:00.280> place<00:04:02.610> second<00:04:03.610> battery

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
back in the same place second battery

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.260 
back in the same place second battery
again<00:04:05.160> red<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:06.400> net<00:04:06.550> positive

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
again red for net positive

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.080 
again red for net positive
black<00:04:07.720> for<00:04:08.140> negative<00:04:08.490> it's<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.520> little<00:04:09.760> easier

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
black for negative it's a little easier

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.540 
black for negative it's a little easier
on<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.330> side<00:04:10.540> because<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.050> black<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.530> for<00:04:12.430> the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
on the side because the black is for the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.160 
on the side because the black is for the
negative<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.420> yellow<00:04:13.630> wire<00:04:13.870> in<00:04:14.080> this

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
negative and the yellow wire in this

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.979 
negative and the yellow wire in this
particular<00:04:14.470> case<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:15.070> for<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.550> positive<00:04:16.000> so

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
particular case is for the positive so

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.270 
particular case is for the positive so
I'm<00:04:17.109> going<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.260> connect<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:17.769> because<00:04:18.130> it's

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
I'm going to connect this because it's

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.790 
I'm going to connect this because it's
nice<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.669> long<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:20.650> positive<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.240> black

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
nice and long the positive and the black

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.200 
nice and long the positive and the black
to<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.830> negative<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.160> will<00:04:27.310> sit<00:04:27.700> right

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
to the negative and it will sit right

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.320 
to the negative and it will sit right
inside<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.720> cradle<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:32.460> little<00:04:33.460> coaxing<00:04:34.060> I

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
inside that cradle a little coaxing I

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.600 
inside that cradle a little coaxing I
didn't<00:04:35.230> quite<00:04:35.380> get<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.710> negative<00:04:36.040> on<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:36.400> do

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
didn't quite get the negative on so do

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.370 
didn't quite get the negative on so do
make<00:04:36.970> sure<00:04:37.030> that's<00:04:37.330> on<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.750> then<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.200> have<00:04:38.350> a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
make sure that's on and then you have a

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.060 
make sure that's on and then you have a
completed<00:04:38.860> system<00:04:39.930> now<00:04:40.930> what<00:04:41.919> you'll

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
completed system now what you'll

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.710 
completed system now what you'll
probably<00:04:42.130> want<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.460> do<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.669> get<00:04:42.790> some<00:04:42.940> tape<00:04:43.210> put

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
probably want to do is get some tape put

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.690 
probably want to do is get some tape put
it<00:04:43.810> on<00:04:43.900> both<00:04:44.050> sides<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.160> makes<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:45.520> it's

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
it on both sides so it makes it so it's

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.730 
it on both sides so it makes it so it's
a<00:04:45.760> little<00:04:45.850> easier<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.300> handle<00:04:46.630> when<00:04:47.470> you're

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
a little easier to handle when you're

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.330 
a little easier to handle when you're
done<00:04:47.860> take<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:49.030> same<00:04:49.360> system<00:04:49.950> again<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.160> is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
done take that same system again this is

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.659 
done take that same system again this is
leisure<00:04:51.669> because<00:04:51.880> it's<00:04:52.120> already<00:04:52.240> taped<00:04:52.540> up

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
leisure because it's already taped up

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.400 
leisure because it's already taped up
you'll<00:04:54.669> notice<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:55.750> there's<00:04:55.960> only<00:04:56.080> one<00:04:56.290> way

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
you'll notice that there's only one way

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.440 
you'll notice that there's only one way
to<00:04:56.440> get<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:56.830> battery<00:04:57.250> in<00:04:57.340> here<00:04:57.370> there's<00:04:58.360> a

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
to get this battery in here there's a

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.270 
to get this battery in here there's a
groove<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.229> bottom<00:04:59.560> here<00:04:59.800> that<00:04:59.979> allows

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
groove on the bottom here that allows

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.840 
groove on the bottom here that allows
you<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.580> fit<00:05:00.910> this<00:05:01.660> particular<00:05:02.020> wire<00:05:02.700> just<00:05:03.700> lay

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
you to fit this particular wire just lay

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.650 
you to fit this particular wire just lay
it<00:05:04.000> down<00:05:04.979> slides<00:05:05.979> right<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:06.960> again<00:05:07.960> rehook<00:05:08.680> up

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
it down slides right in again rehook up

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.940 
it down slides right in again rehook up
go<00:05:10.660> all<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.840> way<00:05:10.870> till<00:05:11.169> it<00:05:11.229> usually<00:05:11.590> clicks

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
go all the way till it usually clicks

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.740 
go all the way till it usually clicks
you<00:05:12.580> need<00:05:12.729> to<00:05:12.790> push<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.150> down<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.360> little<00:05:13.600> bit

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
you need to push it down a little bit

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.159 
you need to push it down a little bit
because<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.169> wire<00:05:14.350> pops<00:05:14.620> out

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169
