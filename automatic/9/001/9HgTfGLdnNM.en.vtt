00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.400 

what<00:00:01.319> we<00:00:01.439> do<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:01.920> just<00:00:02.159> bring<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.149> soil<00:00:03.449> and

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
what we do is we just bring the soil and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.440 
what we do is we just bring the soil and
just<00:00:04.680> slowly<00:00:04.980> feed<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.879> around<00:00:06.089> all

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
just slowly feed it in and around all

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.549 
just slowly feed it in and around all
the<00:00:06.660> roots<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:07.200> don't<00:00:07.950> want<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.340> any<00:00:09.059> gaps

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
the roots I don't want to have any gaps

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.530 
the roots I don't want to have any gaps
around<00:00:10.559> these<00:00:10.710> roots<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.790> like<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> bones<00:00:12.300> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
around these roots just like a bones I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.490 
around these roots just like a bones I
will<00:00:13.110> use<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> chopstick<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.580> feed<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> soil

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
will use a chopstick to feed the soil

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.310 
will use a chopstick to feed the soil
right<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:16.650> I'm<00:00:16.800> using<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.100> fingers<00:00:17.609> just<00:00:18.320> come

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
right now I'm using my fingers just come

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
right now I'm using my fingers just come
in<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.070> make<00:00:20.250> sure<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.520> don't<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.760> any

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in here and make sure we don't have any

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.740 
in here and make sure we don't have any
gaps<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:26.960> find<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.109> an<00:00:28.830> area<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.369> bare<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.029> just

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
gaps I find a an area that's bare I just

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
gaps I find a an area that's bare I just
keep<00:00:30.900> working<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.439> soil<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.680> until<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
keep working the soil and until it's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.380 
keep working the soil and until it's
filled<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:37.520> make<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> feeder

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
filled I make sure that all the feeder

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.260 
filled I make sure that all the feeder
roots<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:40.280> carefully<00:00:41.280> protected<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.059> put

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
roots are carefully protected and put

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
roots are carefully protected and put
underneath<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> soil<00:00:43.800> line

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
underneath the soil line

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
underneath the soil line
I<00:00:45.110> want<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> soil<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.070> roots<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.629> away

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I want the soil the roots to go away

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.729 
I want the soil the roots to go away
from<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.559> base<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.809> thicken<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.320> over

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
from the base so as they thicken up over

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
from the base so as they thicken up over
the<00:00:52.829> next<00:00:52.980> few<00:00:53.160> years<00:00:53.219> it'll<00:00:53.699> improve<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the next few years it'll improve the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.810 
the next few years it'll improve the
nebari<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.840> rootage<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.610> not

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
nebari or rootage now right now I'm not

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
nebari or rootage now right now I'm not
worried<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.239> exposing<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> nebari

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
worried about exposing all the nebari

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
worried about exposing all the nebari
I'm<00:00:59.280> worried<00:00:59.760> about<00:00:59.789> getting<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> guy

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I'm worried about getting this guy

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
I'm worried about getting this guy
healthy<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> lot<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> soil<00:01:03.949> buries<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
healthy so a lot of the soil buries the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
healthy so a lot of the soil buries the
ends<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> cut<00:01:06.510> tips<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
ends of the cut tips because with it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.330 
ends of the cut tips because with it
buried<00:01:08.760> it'll<00:01:09.390> help<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.170> roots<00:01:10.380> issue<00:01:10.710> from

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
buried it'll help the roots issue from

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
buried it'll help the roots issue from
the<00:01:11.460> tip<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.000> it'll<00:01:12.390> help<00:01:12.570> heal<00:01:12.840> those<00:01:13.080> cuts

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the tip and it'll help heal those cuts

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
the tip and it'll help heal those cuts
if<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.220> try<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> expose<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> nebari<00:01:15.450> they'll

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
if I try to expose the nebari they'll

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.749 
if I try to expose the nebari they'll
get<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> surface<00:01:16.770> it'll<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.490> apt<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
get on the surface it'll be more apt to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
get on the surface it'll be more apt to
desiccate<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.360> won't<00:01:18.479> grow<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.900> fast<00:01:18.930> you'll

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
desiccate it won't grow as fast you'll

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
desiccate it won't grow as fast you'll
get<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> lot<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.280> rotting<00:01:21.090> believe<00:01:21.540> they're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
get a lot more rotting believe they're

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.130 
get a lot more rotting believe they're
not<00:01:21.689> Cypress<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:23.009> rot<00:01:23.390> they<00:01:24.390> say<00:01:24.630> Cypress<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
not Cypress will rot they say Cypress is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
not Cypress will rot they say Cypress is
immune<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> rot<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.430> only<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.790> old

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
immune to rot but really only the old

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.109 
immune to rot but really only the old
growth<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:28.110> immune<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> rot<00:01:28.799> young<00:01:29.189> wood<00:01:29.579> like

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
growth is immune to rot young wood like

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.969 
growth is immune to rot young wood like
the<00:01:30.479> roots<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> fresh<00:01:31.680> growth

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the roots and a lot of the fresh growth

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.780 
the roots and a lot of the fresh growth
will<00:01:32.189> rot<00:01:33.200> actually<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:34.409> quickly<00:01:34.790> you'll

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
will rot actually pretty quickly you'll

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.539 
will rot actually pretty quickly you'll
notice<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.420> couple<00:01:36.869> years<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
notice a couple years from now when you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
notice a couple years from now when you
dig<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.210> you'll<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> lot<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
dig this out you'll see a lot of the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.550 
dig this out you'll see a lot of the
roots<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.659> were<00:01:42.659> cut<00:01:42.960> initially<00:01:43.439> especially

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
roots that were cut initially especially

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
roots that were cut initially especially
the<00:01:43.920> big<00:01:44.100> cuts<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.180> hollow<00:01:45.509> that's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the big cuts will be hollow that's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
the big cuts will be hollow that's
because<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> root<00:01:47.310> they're<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.360> immune<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
because that root they're not immune to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.390 
because that root they're not immune to
rot<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.680> myth<00:01:50.600> but

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
rot that's a myth but

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.180 
rot that's a myth but
keeping<00:01:53.180> them<00:01:53.300> further<00:01:53.810> buried<00:01:54.320> will<00:01:54.950> help

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
keeping them further buried will help

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.180 
keeping them further buried will help
the<00:01:55.370> roots<00:01:55.660> grow<00:01:56.660> much<00:01:56.960> faster<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.800> they<00:01:57.950> roll

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
the roots grow much faster so they roll

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.310 
the roots grow much faster so they roll
over<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.550> big<00:01:58.940> cut<00:01:59.240> with<00:01:59.600> fresh<00:01:59.990> feeder

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
over that big cut with fresh feeder

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.740 
over that big cut with fresh feeder
roots<00:02:00.590> around<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.980> edge<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.390> will<00:02:02.660> have

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
roots around the edge so you will have

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.270 
roots around the edge so you will have
you<00:02:03.440> know<00:02:03.500> see<00:02:03.770> little<00:02:05.740> figure<00:02:06.740> in<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.010> tree

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
you know see little figure in the tree

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.249 
you know see little figure in the tree
by<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.149> way<00:02:08.300> there<00:02:08.540> is<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.660> lot<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:08.929> sigh

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
by the way there is a lot of sigh

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.500 
by the way there is a lot of sigh
procedure<00:02:09.679> there<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.040> we<00:02:10.190> collected<00:02:10.790> we<00:02:11.390> did
