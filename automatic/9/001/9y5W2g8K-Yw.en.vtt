00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi to all so today it's 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.680
 Thursday on watch beds and so it's up to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.740
 my turn to make the video of the week 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.410
 so the theme is to talk to you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.780
 of our wish list it turns out that I 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 not really expected what I was going to say 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.010
 but I will find there is no problem 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 so to start the first thing 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
 which i thought is the naked 3 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 since it will be released very soon and I 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.390
 thought it was nice then at the same time 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 I hesitate a bit because there are 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.279
 lighthouses that I already have in the year that 2 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 but it's true that it makes me a lot 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.850
 of the eye because that's but who 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 normal dickey it's great and then he 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 must say what is I saw a preview 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.190
 women and it makes you so eager 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.520
 that suddenly I think I'm going 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 maybe turn me towards these 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.700
 products there otherwise I also saw some 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.950
 boots or boots rather heels 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.059
 magnify that make me think a little about 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.460
 wander that people like a lot 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.559
 this moment but it comes out a little bit 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 red velvet and censorship alone 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.199
 knows at 50 euros 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.820
 I'll put a little picture there if 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.280
 I had trouble finding but I admit that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.949
 it gives me too much desire because 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.229
 for the winter it's top the color and hop 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.060
 there the model is top and I really 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.049
 want to buy it from me if not I think 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 possibly year ermax so from home 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.700
 nike 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.960
 I know a lot of people 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.759
 German but it's still 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 sneakers that I really like and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.570
 even though many people do not 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 not understand the craze for nike 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.700
 I like it and it does not matter if 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.070
 people like it or not that it's at the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.009
 fashion or not me I like so I 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 thought to buy me otherwise what he me 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.090
 must absolutely and that's not limited 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.740
 negotiable it's actually lights 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.710
 because now it's dark 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.150
 extremely early at 5 o'clock we can already 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.009
 more filming is horror because 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.210
 like all high schools we are 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.189
 students who makes videos on 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.860
 youtube we run and so when we 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.720
 come back from school it's nighttime you can not 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.190
 not filming those horrible ones plus we have to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.050
 do for us a video 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.630
 per week the goal we have a collab and 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.440
 it's absolutely horrible because 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.480
 that we have to organize 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.700
 on wednesday actually me if I do not film 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.160
 the video on wednesday I'm a little finished 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 and at the end of my life so here I am 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.070
 the filmed on Sunday so you can 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.380
 see how I'm organized for a 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.270
 it changes but suddenly it's true 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.620
 that it's not necessarily very practical and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.360
 when I have lights in less I 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.500
 can really filmed at any 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.390
 what time of day or night 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.610
 I do not think I will film at 5am 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.530
 matte but hey you understood the beds 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.360
 forgiveness so that may be 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.770
 really well it's true that it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.750
 it may be the first idea of 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.640
 gift that comes to mind as would say 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.530
 my friend adele I was going to say that he 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.870
 will recognize but necessarily because I 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.220
 I am first a showcase 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.510
 anthony one points to me alone 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.580
 since would bring me maybe contains 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.090
 a fraction of who come this store 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.130
 go I'm in love with this brand there 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.340
 is I almost always with me I 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.120
 to say of this boat especially that by 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.920
 example the proof 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.650
 masson just encrypted between a canvas 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.670
 is besides touati roof neither my little 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.800
 matter you tell the british to 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.940
 the American I talked about it once on 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.950
 my personal channel and that makes a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.150
 riot to what people were saying north 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.489
 does not mean like that but if it takes 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.489
 to say like that , I'm going very far 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.880
 not go now to the little 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.709
 questionnaire of the week since 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.900
 now we will try to do more 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.070
 several questions rather than one and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.410
 so this is a short questionnaire on 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.209
 Christmas and Christmas is so much a moment 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.640
 that I love I'm gameline when we 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.170
 talk about christmas i like too wise man 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.730
 sir lorraine who just 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.420
 think i'm too happy with that rox and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.370
 in a very short time 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.160
 first question is your dish 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.320
 favorite christmas so i have long 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.700
 hesitated and finally I think it 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.980
 be the Jacques scallops 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 I really like that you have to know that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.500
 when I was little we thought that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.180
 I was allergic to notes without 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.140
 jacques which is absolutely not the case 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.209
 which makes me privately 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.980
 for maybe ten years and I have 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.720
 rediscovered this pleasure when he 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.310
 a bit since finally surrendered 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.150
 I never had an allergy 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.140
 conad saint jacques 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.659
 so I take advantage of it and I'm on my way 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.590
 on this continues in Christmas aromas it's 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.980
 really something that I like 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.069
 a lot 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.260
 then we will have the with whom and 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.200
 how do you fart Christmas then I do it 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.459
 from home with my family and so with 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.530
 my mother we decided to do something 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.239
 sick so we will really give ourselves 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.129
 for the fir tree in terms of 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.099
 decoration I will probably 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.870
 do on my personal channel one of 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.370
 decoration ideas dedicated wade stuff 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.370
 like that because I think it 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.570
 could please so that's all so 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.440
 you never want to see it down it will be 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.300
 maybe soon on my channel 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.050
 personal and finally my song 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.000
 favorite christmas then there is not so much 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.400
 Christmas songs that I want to 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.430
 tell you the basic song of mariah 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.600
 carey where she sings for christmas you the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.289
 to hurt a fake because I have not 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.479
 to be leader 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.220
 I think we will answer a lot 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.260
 the same thing but it's really the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.820
 song that I like a lot and when we 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.580
 listen to them once in the course of the whole 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.889
 day and we really sing it without 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.930
 stop so that's my song 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.729
 favorite christmas my video is now 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.139
 I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.760
 I'll meet you next Thursday 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.110
 for the theme of the week and by then 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.460
 I hope you wear me very well I 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.460
 you make standards of salvation
