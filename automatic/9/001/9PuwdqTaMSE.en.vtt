actually end up playing somebody on the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
actually end up playing somebody on the
pc<00:02:30.680> but<00:02:31.520> um<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.840> that's<00:02:33.050> not<00:02:33.200> they<00:02:33.320> actually

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
pc but um so that's not they actually

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.710 
pc but um so that's not they actually
probably<00:02:33.890> take<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.490> even<00:02:35.030> though<00:02:35.180> i<00:02:35.270> do<00:02:35.390> use

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
probably take to it even though i do use

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600 
probably take to it even though i do use
a<00:02:35.750> controller<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.440> drive<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.070> vehicles<00:02:37.490> on

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
a controller to drive the vehicles on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.370 
a controller to drive the vehicles on
the<00:02:37.640> game<00:02:37.910> i<00:02:38.120> use<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> mouse<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.110> keyboard

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the game i use the mouse and keyboard

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.800 
the game i use the mouse and keyboard
for<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> infantry<00:02:40.400> kind<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.730> stuff<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.210> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
for the infantry kind of stuff and the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.780 
for the infantry kind of stuff and the
reason<00:02:41.930> i<00:02:42.080> use<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> controller<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
reason i use the controller on the on

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.310 
reason i use the controller on the on
the<00:02:43.820> vehicle<00:02:44.480> side<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.900> game<00:02:45.050> because

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the vehicle side of the game because

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.070 
the vehicle side of the game because
it's<00:02:45.470> easier<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:46.310> perfectly<00:02:46.670> honest<00:02:47.080> it's

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
it's easier be perfectly honest it's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.600 
it's easier be perfectly honest it's
easier<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.650> drive<00:02:48.830> like<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.190> tank<00:02:49.460> or

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
easier to drive like the tank or

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.960 
easier to drive like the tank or

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
pc game a little bit mainly because the

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.900 
pc game a little bit mainly because the
DPI<00:04:23.510> on<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.870> fly<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:25.040> extra<00:04:25.400> buttons<00:04:25.760> on

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
DPI on the fly and the extra buttons on

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.490 
DPI on the fly and the extra buttons on
it<00:04:25.940> there's<00:04:26.270> got<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.600> five<00:04:26.810> button<00:04:27.140> mouse
