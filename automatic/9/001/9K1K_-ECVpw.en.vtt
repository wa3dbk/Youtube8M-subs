bad they usually break away from the
midsole<00:00:20.000> you<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.680> just

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
midsole you can see it's just it's just

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.480 
midsole you can see it's just it's just
flaking<00:00:23.189> off<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:25.350> midsole<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.949> with

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
flaking off there so the midsole is with

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.460 
flaking off there so the midsole is with
with<00:00:26.760> usually<00:00:27.180> fails<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.720> these<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.320> see

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
with usually fails on these you can see

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.510 
with usually fails on these you can see
not<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> bottom<00:00:29.390> not<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.619> in<00:00:31.619> bottom<00:00:32.250> part

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
not the bottom not the in bottom part

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.670 
not the bottom not the in bottom part
with<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> tread<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.719> intact<00:00:34.200> still<00:00:36.680> get

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
with the tread that's intact still get

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.369 
with the tread that's intact still get
all<00:00:37.829> over<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> couch<00:00:38.809> but<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
all over the couch but you can see the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.150 
all over the couch but you can see the
bottoms<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.890> intact<00:00:41.250> still<00:00:42.950> there's<00:00:43.950> some

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
bottoms are intact still there's some

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.330 
bottoms are intact still there's some
mid<00:00:44.370> soles<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> air<00:00:45.300> bubbles<00:00:45.980> toast<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
mid soles and the air bubbles toast I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.600 
mid soles and the air bubbles toast I
mean<00:00:47.520> these<00:00:47.640> were<00:00:47.879> done<00:00:48.860> before<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
mean these were done before but this is

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
mean these were done before but this is
what<00:00:50.789> happens<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.899> 93<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
what happens these are from like 93 I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.069 
what happens these are from like 93 I
think<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:56.180> not<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.629> restore

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
think so not that you would restore

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.340 
think so not that you would restore
these<00:00:58.320> maybe<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.800> would<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.690> wouldn't<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
these maybe you would I wouldn't but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.750 
these maybe you would I wouldn't but
when<00:01:02.340> people<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.789> restorations<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:05.100> them

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.539 

control<00:01:09.380> when<00:01:10.380> people<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.770> restorations

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
control when people do restorations

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.230 
control when people do restorations
they'll<00:01:12.049> get<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.409> stuff<00:01:13.740> off<00:01:14.240> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
they'll get all this stuff off the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
they'll get all this stuff off the
midsole<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.110> they'll<00:01:16.470> keep<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.920> bottom<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
midsole and they'll keep the bottom and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
midsole and they'll keep the bottom and
they'll<00:01:17.729> keep<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> top<00:01:18.360> usually<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they'll keep the top usually would be in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.249 
they'll keep the top usually would be in
better<00:01:19.830> condition<00:01:19.950> than<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.720> then

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
better condition than this and then

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.450 
better condition than this and then
they'll<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> sole<00:01:23.909> swap<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> another

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
they'll do a sole swap with like another

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
they'll do a sole swap with like another
midsole<00:01:26.460> swap<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.090> another<00:01:27.360> similar

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
midsole swap with like another similar

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.039 
midsole swap with like another similar
shoe<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> air<00:01:30.930> bound<00:01:31.970> air<00:01:33.049> air

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
shoe so these are the air bound air air

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.609 
shoe so these are the air bound air air
bound<00:01:34.530> air<00:01:35.009> bound<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:36.380> these<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
bound air bound to I think these are a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.410 
bound air bound to I think these are a
little<00:01:38.040> ooh<00:01:38.250> these<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.700> tight
