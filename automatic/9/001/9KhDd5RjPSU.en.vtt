00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that these are botanical extracts you're

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
that these are botanical extracts you're
taking<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> botanical<00:00:26.670> material<00:00:27.300> extracting

of these phytochemicals into a form
that's<00:00:33.690> much<00:00:34.170> higher<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> would<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.190> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that's much higher than it would if you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.209 
that's much higher than it would if you
just<00:00:35.430> say<00:00:35.730> consumed<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> plant<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.809> its<00:00:36.989> own

know much about their pharmacological

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
know much about their pharmacological
activity<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.520> only<00:00:50.760> example<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.420> I'd

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
activity and it's only example that I'd

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.850 
activity and it's only example that I'd
like<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> there's<00:00:52.620> been<00:00:52.739> over

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
like to use is that there's been over

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.459 
like to use is that there's been over
500<00:00:53.489> unique<00:00:54.090> phytochemicals<00:00:54.840> identified<00:00:55.320> in

panax ginseng and just about every multi
botanical<00:00:59.640> supplement<00:01:00.149> has<00:01:00.270> panicked

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
botanical supplement has panicked

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
botanical supplement has panicked
ginseng<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.129> there's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
ginseng in and so if you think there's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
ginseng in and so if you think there's
500<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> panax<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> you've<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> six

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
500 or so and panax and you've got six

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.230 
500 or so and panax and you've got six
or<00:01:04.769> seven<00:01:05.010> others<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
or seven others and it's a it's a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
or seven others and it's a it's a
multitude<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:07.280> compounds<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.580> those

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
multitude of compounds that are in those

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.590 
multitude of compounds that are in those
things<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> another<00:01:11.600> another

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
things and so this is another another

have to solubilize some of these

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.199 
have to solubilize some of these

and<00:03:12.450> such<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.430> lot<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.240> vitro

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
and such and so so a lot of the in vitro

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.990 
and such and so so a lot of the in vitro
studies<00:03:16.020> almost<00:03:16.320> always<00:03:16.709> imply<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.489> there's

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
studies almost always imply that there's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.970 
studies almost always imply that there's
going<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.180> be<00:03:18.269> some<00:03:18.570> type<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.780> adverse<00:03:19.560> effect

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
going to be some type of adverse effect

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.699 
going to be some type of adverse effect
but<00:03:20.670> rarely<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:21.239> those<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.570> vitro<00:03:21.900> situations

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
but rarely do those in vitro situations

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.520 
but rarely do those in vitro situations
translate<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.820> vivo<00:03:24.030> condition<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
translate to the in vivo condition and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.430 
translate to the in vivo condition and
so<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.860> me<00:03:26.239> just<00:03:27.239> my<00:03:27.420> personal<00:03:27.870> opinion<00:03:27.959> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
so to me just my personal opinion is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.560 
so to me just my personal opinion is
that<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.160> most<00:03:29.400> definitive<00:03:30.360> way<00:03:30.510> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
that the the most definitive way to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.360 
that the the most definitive way to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
