00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
see one just on its own on its shock

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
see one just on its own on its shock
mount<00:00:36.269> it's<00:00:37.199> it's<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.680> K&amp;N<00:00:39.019> stand<00:00:40.019> which<00:00:40.410> is

mount it's it's on a K&amp;N stand which is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.890 
mount it's it's on a K&amp;N stand which is
really<00:00:41.100> rugged<00:00:41.339> and<00:00:41.699> subtly<00:00:42.120> designed<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.629> um

drum overheads it's got a massive
counterweight<00:00:47.430> which<00:00:47.730> stops<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.629> from

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
counterweight which stops them from

counterweight which stops them from
falling<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.170> ground<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.680> yeah<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> just

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
falling to the ground and yeah I just

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
falling to the ground and yeah I just
wanted<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> show<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.539> important<00:00:52.079> having

wanted to show you how important having
a<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:52.949> good<00:00:53.070> mic<00:00:53.219> stand<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a really good mic stand it is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
a really good mic stand it is
particularly<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> value<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
particularly with this kind of value of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.360 
particularly with this kind of value of
microphone<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.989> they<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.170> small<00:00:59.070> diaphragm

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
microphone and they are small diaphragm

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.830 
microphone and they are small diaphragm
convent's<00:00:59.940> condensers<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.719> are

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
convent's condensers but they are

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
convent's condensers but they are
surprisingly<00:01:01.649> heavy<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> shock<00:01:03.030> mount

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
surprisingly heavy to the shock mount

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.540 
surprisingly heavy to the shock mount
and<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> large<00:01:04.339> transformer<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
and also the the large transformer that

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.719 
and also the the large transformer that
comes<00:01:05.759> with<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.179> part<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> design<00:01:06.929> and<00:01:07.729> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
comes with as part of the design and so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
comes with as part of the design and so
first<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.149> all<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:10.050> just<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.410> show<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
first of all I'm just going to show you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
first of all I'm just going to show you
what<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.009> microphones<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.119> its<00:01:12.360> own<00:01:12.570> not

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
what the microphones like on its own not

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.120 
what the microphones like on its own not
in<00:01:13.410> asperity<00:01:13.890> stereo<00:01:14.270> pair<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.800> just<00:01:17.009> want

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in asperity stereo pair and I just want

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.550 
in asperity stereo pair and I just want
to<00:01:17.190> say<00:01:17.310> also<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> video<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> really

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to say also for this video you really

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.339 
to say also for this video you really
should<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.979> using<00:01:20.360> headphones<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.349 
should be using headphones to get that

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.559 
should be using headphones to get that
kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> stereo<00:01:22.830> effect<00:01:23.069> or<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.880> least<00:01:24.209> a<00:01:24.390> pair

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
kind of stereo effect or at least a pair

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.980 
kind of stereo effect or at least a pair
of<00:01:24.630> speakers<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:25.709> afraid

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
of speakers I'm afraid

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.839 
of speakers I'm afraid
laptop<00:01:27.990> speakers<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.679> won't<00:01:28.950> cut<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
laptop speakers just won't cut it so

00:01:29.849 --> 00:02:00.950 
laptop speakers just won't cut it so
anyway<00:01:30.300> let's<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:30.989> how<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.229> sounds

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.860 

ok<00:02:01.960> sounds<00:02:02.530> good<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.830> think<00:02:03.070> however<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.600> would

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
ok sounds good I think however I would

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.810 
ok sounds good I think however I would
say<00:02:05.110> if<00:02:05.530> anything<00:02:05.950> it's<00:02:06.130> perhaps<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.730> little

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
say if anything it's perhaps a little

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.139 
say if anything it's perhaps a little
bit<00:02:07.030> flat<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:09.039> don't<00:02:09.070> really<00:02:09.399> get<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.610> sense<00:02:10.030> of

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
bit flat you don't really get a sense of

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.110 
bit flat you don't really get a sense of
the<00:02:10.240> room<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:12.070> don't<00:02:12.220> have<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.580> kind<00:02:13.030> of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the room and you don't have the kind of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.500 
the room and you don't have the kind of
three-dimensional<00:02:14.250> sound<00:02:15.250> going<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.270> for

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
three-dimensional sound going on but for

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.960 
three-dimensional sound going on but for
many<00:02:16.660> mixes<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.140> will<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.320> perfect<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:18.790> we've

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
many mixes it will be perfect now we've

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
many mixes it will be perfect now we've
got<00:02:19.180> an<00:02:20.170> XY<00:02:20.680> configuration<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:23.140> XY<00:02:23.410> is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
got an XY configuration here so XY is

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.240 
got an XY configuration here so XY is
where<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.490> capsules<00:02:24.940> are<00:02:25.590> pretty<00:02:26.590> much<00:02:26.740> next

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
where the capsules are pretty much next

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.370 
where the capsules are pretty much next
to<00:02:27.340> each<00:02:27.400> other<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.450> bodies<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
to each other and that the bodies of the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.680 
to each other and that the bodies of the
mic<00:02:29.530> friends<00:02:29.800> are<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.190> 45-degree<00:02:31.120> angle<00:02:31.150> from

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
mic friends are a 45-degree angle from

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.760 
mic friends are a 45-degree angle from
each<00:02:31.780> other<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.040> idea<00:02:33.280> being<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:34.770> you

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
each other so the idea being you can you

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.010 
each other so the idea being you can you
pan<00:02:36.310> each<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.180> microphones<00:02:37.750> hard

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
pan each of the the microphones hard

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.920 
pan each of the the microphones hard
left<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.470> right<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.510> shouldn't<00:02:40.780> have

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
left and right and you shouldn't have

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.710 
left and right and you shouldn't have
any<00:02:41.110> face<00:02:41.260> problems<00:02:41.739> if<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.610> don't<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.970> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
any face problems if you don't like the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.420 
any face problems if you don't like the
result<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.410> you're<00:02:44.650> not<00:02:44.770> if<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.100> doesn't<00:02:45.310> quite

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
result if you're not if it doesn't quite

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.030 
result if you're not if it doesn't quite
work<00:02:45.520> with<00:02:45.850> your<00:02:45.970> mix<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.480> can<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:47.020> pan<00:02:47.830> them

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
work with your mix you can just pan them

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.970 
work with your mix you can just pan them
both<00:02:48.580> into<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> middle<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:50.620> should<00:02:50.830> be

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
both into the middle and they should be

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.020 
both into the middle and they should be
fine<00:02:51.190> there<00:02:51.459> shouldn't<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.700> any<00:02:51.850> face

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
fine there shouldn't be any face

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:22.230 
fine there shouldn't be any face
problems<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.530> let's<00:02:53.709> see<00:02:53.830> how<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.010> sounds

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.380 

I<00:03:26.100> really<00:03:27.100> like<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.400> it's<00:03:27.640> really<00:03:28.240> just

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
I really like that it's really just

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.640 
I really like that it's really just
opens<00:03:28.810> out<00:03:28.960> the<00:03:29.110> sound<00:03:29.380> sounds<00:03:30.370> lovely

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
opens out the sound sounds lovely

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.310 
opens out the sound sounds lovely
next<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.830> have<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.340> space<00:03:34.060> pair<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.690> I've<00:03:35.020> left

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
next we have a space pair and I've left

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.310 
next we have a space pair and I've left
them<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:36.100> stereo<00:03:36.550> bar<00:03:36.900> mechanism<00:03:37.900> that

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
them on the stereo bar mechanism that

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.220 
them on the stereo bar mechanism that
comes<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.250> kit<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:40.270> comes<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:41.080> both

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
comes with the kit that comes with both

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.080 
comes with the kit that comes with both
the<00:03:41.260> microphones<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.490> all<00:03:42.760> I've<00:03:42.910> done<00:03:42.940> is

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
the microphones and all I've done is

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.030 
the microphones and all I've done is
I've<00:03:43.360> I've<00:03:43.780> they're<00:03:44.110> now<00:03:44.290> parallel<00:03:44.830> with<00:03:44.890> each

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
I've I've they're now parallel with each

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.750 
I've I've they're now parallel with each
other<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:47.010> one<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.190> microphones<00:03:48.430> is

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
other so one of the microphones is

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.540 
other so one of the microphones is
facing<00:03:49.150> towards<00:03:49.540> probably<00:03:50.500> around<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.370> ninth

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
facing towards probably around the ninth

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.280 
facing towards probably around the ninth
fret<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.180> other<00:03:52.300> one<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.600> pair<00:03:52.840> facing

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
fret and the other one is pair facing

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.250 
fret and the other one is pair facing
near<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.910> sound<00:03:55.150> hole

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
near to the sound hole

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.420 
near to the sound hole
bear<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.770> mind<00:03:56.800> with<00:03:57.100> this<00:03:57.220> kinda<00:03:57.400> thing

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
bear in mind with this kinda thing

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.280 
bear in mind with this kinda thing
you'll<00:03:57.610> have<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.880> adjust<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.930> may<00:03:59.050> have<00:03:59.170> to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
you'll have to adjust you may have to

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.280 
you'll have to adjust you may have to
adjust<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.590> gain<00:03:59.830> on<00:04:00.460> your<00:04:00.580> preamps<00:04:01.290> because

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
adjust the gain on your preamps because

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.710 
adjust the gain on your preamps because
the<00:04:02.850> microphone<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:03.910> can<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.420> your<00:04:04.480> left

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the microphone you can see on your left

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.660 
the microphone you can see on your left
may<00:04:05.200> be<00:04:05.260> picking<00:04:05.800> up<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:05.980> lot<00:04:06.100> more<00:04:06.220> bass<00:04:06.460> that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
may be picking up a lot more bass that

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.800 
may be picking up a lot more bass that
you<00:04:06.760> may<00:04:06.940> need<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.390> adjust<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.530> slightly

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
you may need to adjust it slightly

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:43.100 
you may need to adjust it slightly
anyway<00:04:10.810> let's<00:04:10.960> see<00:04:11.050> how<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.260> sound

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.040 

yeah<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.620> sounds<00:04:44.890> really<00:04:45.070> nice<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.780> next<00:04:46.900> we

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
yeah so sounds really nice so next we

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.800 
yeah so sounds really nice so next we
have<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> more<00:04:47.740> extreme<00:04:48.100> example<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:49.420> space

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
have a more extreme example of a space

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.990 
have a more extreme example of a space
pair<00:04:50.280> these<00:04:51.280> guys<00:04:51.550> here<00:04:51.850> are<00:04:52.030> probably<00:04:52.800> about

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
pair these guys here are probably about

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.200 
pair these guys here are probably about
over<00:04:55.000> over<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.300> meter<00:04:55.570> apart<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.490> probably<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
over over a meter apart and probably the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.360 
over over a meter apart and probably the
best<00:04:58.330> part<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:59.080> meter<00:04:59.320> away<00:04:59.560> from<00:04:59.710> the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
best part of a meter away from the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.070 
best part of a meter away from the
guitar<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:01.150> it's<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.360> really<00:05:01.600> kind<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.810> wide

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
guitar so it's a really kind of wide

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.600 
guitar so it's a really kind of wide
example<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.810> there<00:05:04.810> aren't<00:05:04.990> many<00:05:05.370> times<00:05:06.370> when

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
example and there aren't many times when

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.700 
example and there aren't many times when
I<00:05:06.700> would<00:05:06.880> I<00:05:07.090> would<00:05:07.390> think<00:05:07.600> this<00:05:08.080> would<00:05:08.290> be<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
I would I would think this would be the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.800 
I would I would think this would be the
kind<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.310> miking<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.700> would<00:05:09.820> use<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.360> then<00:05:10.510> you

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
kind of miking I would use but then you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.420 
kind of miking I would use but then you
know<00:05:10.930> each<00:05:11.200> of<00:05:11.380> their<00:05:11.470> own<00:05:11.620> let's<00:05:12.220> see<00:05:12.310> it

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
know each of their own let's see it

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:53.530 
know each of their own let's see it
sounds

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.600 

you
