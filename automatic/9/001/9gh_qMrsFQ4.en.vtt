the next video the video size is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
the next video the video size is
different<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.409> haven't<00:01:14.220> researched<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.790> enough

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
different I haven't researched it enough

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.210 
different I haven't researched it enough
to<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.840> settings<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> phone<00:01:16.830> are

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.770 

able<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.490> both<00:01:20.700> videos<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> same<00:01:21.509> size

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
able to make both videos the same size

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
able to make both videos the same size
or<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.380> assume<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.549> can

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
or not I would assume because you can

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.480 
or not I would assume because you can
get<00:01:23.880> further<00:01:24.090> away<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.009> backward

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
get further away with the the backward

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.819 
get further away with the the backward
camera<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.450> maybe<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.409> why<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> video

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
camera that maybe that's why the video

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069 
camera that maybe that's why the video
Zeiss<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.460> bigger<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.930> these

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
Zeiss is bigger so when you see these

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
Zeiss is bigger so when you see these

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.930 
here has rounded edges and rounded
corners<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:15.150> doors<00:04:16.130> which<00:04:17.130> I'll<00:04:17.340> walk<00:04:17.549> over

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
corners the doors which I'll walk over

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.569 
corners the doors which I'll walk over
here<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.359> showing<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.320> hopefully<00:04:20.250> we<00:04:20.340> can

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
here and showing you hopefully we can

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.790 
here and showing you hopefully we can
get<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:20.700> decent<00:04:20.940> shot<00:04:21.500> are

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
get a decent shot are

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.320 
get a decent shot are
like<00:04:25.650> at<00:04:26.650> or<00:04:27.250> have<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> line<00:04:27.910> running<00:04:28.210> through

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
like at or have a line running through

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.110 
like at or have a line running through
them<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.229> molded<00:04:29.770> it's<00:04:29.919> not<00:04:30.130> cut<00:04:30.430> out<00:04:30.610> so

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
them that is molded it's not cut out so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.379 
them that is molded it's not cut out so
hopefully<00:04:32.020> this<00:04:32.139> is<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.289> good<00:04:32.530> shot<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.389> right

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
hopefully this is a good shot and right

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.170 
hopefully this is a good shot and right
here<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.750> can<00:04:34.870> see<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.169> is<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.410> rounded<00:04:35.919> edge

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
here you can see this is a rounded edge

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.749 
here you can see this is a rounded edge
so<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.660> also<00:04:38.349> there<00:04:38.530> there<00:04:39.009> is<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> handle<00:04:39.610> here

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
so and also there there is a handle here

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.510 
so and also there there is a handle here
that<00:04:39.789> is<00:04:40.199> not<00:04:41.199> stout<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.889> it's<00:04:42.039> actually<00:04:42.370> got

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
that is not stout and it's actually got

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.629 
that is not stout and it's actually got
a<00:04:42.550> beveled<00:04:43.530> beveled<00:04:44.530> edge<00:04:44.889> underneath<00:04:45.460> the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
a beveled beveled edge underneath the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.820 
a beveled beveled edge underneath the
handle<00:04:45.819> where<00:04:46.120> when<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:46.449> pull<00:04:46.660> it<00:04:46.750> open<00:04:46.900> I'll

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
handle where when you pull it open I'll

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.020 
handle where when you pull it open I'll
get<00:04:47.979> around<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:48.310> way<00:04:48.490> when<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:48.729> pull<00:04:48.940> it

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
get around this way when you pull it

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.600 
get around this way when you pull it
open<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:50.500> actually<00:04:50.919> can<00:04:51.039> get<00:04:51.130> your<00:04:51.310> fingers

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
open you actually can get your fingers

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.999 
open you actually can get your fingers
in<00:04:51.699> there<00:04:51.759> get<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.509> grip<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:53.009> so

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
in there get in and get a grip on it so

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.370 
in there get in and get a grip on it so
I'm<00:04:54.580> not<00:04:54.639> sure<00:04:55.090> what<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.360> material<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:55.930> again

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
I'm not sure what the material is again

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.960 
I'm not sure what the material is again
the<00:04:56.530> construction<00:04:56.800> appears<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.580> be<00:04:57.699> similar

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
the construction appears to be similar

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.779 
the construction appears to be similar
to<00:04:58.090> putting<00:04:58.360> together<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:59.220> piece<00:05:00.220> of<00:05:00.370> particle

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
to putting together a piece of particle

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.469 
to putting together a piece of particle
board<00:05:01.210> furniture<00:05:01.360> but<00:05:02.080> don't<00:05:02.949> think<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.310> is<00:05:03.520> if

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
board furniture but don't think it is if

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.909 
board furniture but don't think it is if
it<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.840> it's<00:05:05.050> throwing<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.320> good<00:05:05.440> particle

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
it is it's throwing a good particle

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.370 
it is it's throwing a good particle
board<00:05:06.099> anyway<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:06.729> is<00:05:07.030> one<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.080> sides

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
can get a good enough shot this is one

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.420 
can get a good enough shot this is one
of<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.669> sides<00:05:57.909> that<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.210> left<00:05:58.449> on<00:05:59.130> dusted<00:06:00.130> and

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
of the sides that I left on dusted and

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.779 
of the sides that I left on dusted and
you<00:06:01.090> can't<00:06:01.330> really<00:06:01.539> see<00:06:01.870> it<00:06:02.159> but<00:06:03.159> yeah<00:06:03.490> there's

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
you can't really see it but yeah there's

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.100 
you can't really see it but yeah there's
a<00:06:03.849> little<00:06:04.030> bit<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.389> dust<00:06:04.570> I<00:06:04.780> mean<00:06:04.810> it's

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
a little bit of the dust I mean it's

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.089 
a little bit of the dust I mean it's
minimal<00:06:05.830> but<00:06:06.780> you<00:06:07.780> know<00:06:07.900> dusting<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:08.800> before

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
minimal but you know dusting it before

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.700 
minimal but you know dusting it before
you<00:06:09.190> put<00:06:09.340> it<00:06:09.460> together<00:06:09.580> will<00:06:10.000> certainly<00:06:10.330> save

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
you put it together will certainly save

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.020 
you put it together will certainly save
trying<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.800> get<00:06:11.919> into<00:06:12.070> cracks<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.490> crevices

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
trying to get into cracks and crevices

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.790 
trying to get into cracks and crevices
and<00:06:13.210> it's<00:06:13.330> it's<00:06:13.630> got<00:06:13.810> dust<00:06:14.080> everywhere<00:06:14.500> it's

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
and it's it's got dust everywhere it's

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.459 
and it's it's got dust everywhere it's
not<00:06:14.949> bad<00:06:15.280> in<00:06:15.580> fact<00:06:16.539> the<00:06:16.719> dust<00:06:16.930> rag<00:06:17.139> doesn't

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
not bad in fact the dust rag doesn't

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.409 
not bad in fact the dust rag doesn't
even<00:06:17.560> look<00:06:17.680> dirty<00:06:17.919> when<00:06:18.159> you're<00:06:18.280> done<00:06:18.490> but<00:06:18.849> the

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
even look dirty when you're done but the

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.689 
even look dirty when you're done but the
other<00:06:19.599> hint<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.289> don't<00:06:20.710> use<00:06:21.009> a<00:06:21.039> pledge<00:06:21.430> or

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
other hint is don't use a pledge or

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.260 
other hint is don't use a pledge or
oil-based<00:06:22.560> furniture<00:06:23.560> polish<00:06:23.740> it's<00:06:24.159> not<00:06:24.550> real

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
oil-based furniture polish it's not real

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.680 
oil-based furniture polish it's not real
wood<00:06:25.570> and<00:06:26.250> if<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.430> put<00:06:27.669> an<00:06:27.789> oil-based<00:06:28.030> I<00:06:28.419> use

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
wood and if you put an oil-based I use

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.800 
wood and if you put an oil-based I use
some<00:06:28.870> pledge<00:06:29.080> got<00:06:29.860> some<00:06:30.070> streaks<00:06:30.599> take<00:06:31.599> some

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
some pledge got some streaks take some

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.430 
some pledge got some streaks take some
time<00:06:32.020> had<00:06:32.289> to<00:06:32.380> rub<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:32.979> streaks<00:06:33.250> out<00:06:33.460> so<00:06:33.880> I'm

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
time had to rub the streaks out so I'm

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.600 
time had to rub the streaks out so I'm
guessing<00:06:35.440> you<00:06:35.560> need<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.830> clean<00:06:36.039> it<00:06:36.219> with

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
guessing you need to clean it with

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.469 
guessing you need to clean it with
just<00:06:37.030> a<00:06:37.120> damp<00:06:37.330> rag<00:06:37.569> and<00:06:38.020> wipe<00:06:38.110> it<00:06:38.439> down<00:06:38.500> with<00:06:38.650> a

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
just a damp rag and wipe it down with a

just a damp rag and wipe it down with a

it's in a1 shape there is quite a bit of

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.189 
it's in a1 shape there is quite a bit of
hardware<00:06:57.340> it's<00:06:58.210> going<00:06:58.419> to<00:06:58.479> be<00:06:58.569> interesting<00:06:58.780> to

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
hardware it's going to be interesting to

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.879 
hardware it's going to be interesting to
see<00:06:59.409> how<00:06:59.969> long<00:07:00.969> it<00:07:01.030> takes<00:07:01.449> to<00:07:01.629> assemble<00:07:01.930> it<00:07:02.169> the

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
see how long it takes to assemble it the

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.469 
see how long it takes to assemble it the
instructions<00:07:03.250> are<00:07:03.610> pretty<00:07:03.759> straightforward

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
instructions are pretty straightforward

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.589 
instructions are pretty straightforward
and<00:07:04.569> simple<00:07:04.750> looking<00:07:05.969> looks<00:07:06.969> like<00:07:07.150> a<00:07:07.180> Phillips

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 
and simple looking looks like a Phillips

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:10.920 
and simple looking looks like a Phillips
screwdriver<00:07:07.810> only<00:07:08.729> so<00:07:09.729> we'll<00:07:09.939> see<00:07:10.210> I'm<00:07:10.750> going

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
screwdriver only so we'll see I'm going

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.689 
screwdriver only so we'll see I'm going
to<00:07:10.990> get<00:07:11.110> after<00:07:11.289> it<00:07:11.500> right<00:07:11.710> now<00:07:11.919> and<00:07:12.279> we'll<00:07:12.490> see

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
to get after it right now and we'll see

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:23.030 
to get after it right now and we'll see
how<00:07:12.879> long<00:07:13.029> it<00:07:13.210> takes<00:07:13.240> be<00:07:14.080> back<00:07:14.319> at<00:07:14.560> you<00:07:14.740> soon
