00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.080
 the search criteria we have eternal I do not know him any good episode 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.749
 Hard times and that's why I wanted to do it now 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.289
 to record a new episode of it and still know well be creative 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.610
 Founder I'm probably introducing Calixto to one now 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.390
 but I wanted to give you a little idea once 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.460
 that Europeans even use products differently than you know 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.340
 So you have a lot more possibilities, so to speak, than you might have 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.750
 is aware of or aware of it 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.130
 No matter companion while laughing smog but I think that the tips for stews are quite 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.770
 quite a lot are very helpful 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 in fact 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.149
 Cayley am Neckar use products for something other than for them 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.550
 there are missed pass is so now as an example 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.430
 January is putting a lipstick on some but is tapping on the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 wear completely clear 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.710
 but 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.040
 you can also take that as a crow Roche for example I am now 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.570
 completely made-up because of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.800
 Herrmann-Josef Food on hand so I suppose that would be Euro hiking 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.100
 Petra is just a little bit here 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 on a PUK because a bit on or 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.500
 and if I falsify that now 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.750
 then he has this lipstick clay 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.630
 as the roots 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 Throw one can recognize that in the chamber at all 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 and just compared with your finger 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 and then he has just made the dance so there can MA 10 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.250
 so very light 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.210
 Reusch do 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.259
 just like that 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.789
 Curacao lipsticks 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.879
 as greenpeace activists that means i suppose he has, for example 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.240
 and pretty daring fools and wanted to make and great everyday look 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 then just wear it on your eyes 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 Odenthal castle he walked with brush or in the finger 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.670
 and Miracle asked for a nice creamy beating 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.229
 the advantage is how many times have I always taken a thousand things or if you have 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.949
 for example a bit edgier about lipsticks Hartl's Jagertee 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.949
 from Elop these rose-colored ones 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.560
 Awesome Thon are now also great for spring and Procter 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:17.489
 about it 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.370
 and who you can do that just as said on the eyes that's him 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.409
 comparable to very creamy beat 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.589
 the same 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.749
 you can put yours in the shade 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.419
 Now, as an example, I take something from my children's palette here 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:32.299
 perhaps 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.619
 Percent in the mosques are apply 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.909
 and 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.700
 then you have a really great 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.979
 Roche so that's just too happy to walk 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.729
 it does not matter 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:46.989
 back then 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.860
 Name super nice fresh US bothers 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.140
 and there we are in some states suddenly completely new possibilities 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.900
 Just as he can just say when he is the percent 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.140
 a relatively discreet Ron Hermione has instead of a rest 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.979
 and then you can get an explanation 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.979
 I have to take for example 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.809
 and just give you that a little bit on the go 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.329
 you can speak this year so to speak 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.299
 Give Lipstick Erwin bit 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.069
 Well, I do not have it so great at eye make-up, though 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.279
 but it's about the quality Marl 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.979
 Year opens up new opportunities so Spielberg MARUM you can too 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:35.019
 mentality have been completely in just a few eggs complained 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.939
 Apply here directly to the bank runs for gentle and highlight that could 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.939
 then, for example, never liability for Peter or something 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.509
 and maybe I'll score a goal "inviting a bit more ours 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.149
 Do not think so in the prescribed Born game 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.909
 and you have 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.760
 "I value judgment Happy" If EMI answer in the video where you almost exactly 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.040
 just tried these things out and that keeps her dead with her 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.030
 cope Extensis Meeke from a totally creative Sacher and the 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.049
 could make up so much 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.319
 and that's been good news with Real since 400 million 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.310
 People are on the 9th but I want to see you soon 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.279
 over clock instead 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.949
 So I would like to get wet in the really great range 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.099
 and then year I just want you a bit 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.099
 which is difficult 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.789
 Eagle at the 1 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:31.659
 in flames
