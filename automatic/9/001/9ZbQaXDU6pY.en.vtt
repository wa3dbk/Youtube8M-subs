00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.450
 yesterday encourage the flower and weiss anzardo 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:09.480
 Imagine 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.860
 the friends 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.599
 good to all youtube people 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.750
 welcome again this video tutorial 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.689
 where are we going to mention what I 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.490
 you said mostly about ask for 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.840
 comments on that mess there is for 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.710
 there with the boxes that everyone is 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 bundled 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.699
 so let's see if I do not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.439
 I said clearly that it can be but this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.269
 tutorial is going to be a compilation of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.759
 boxes worth of all types of boxes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 that throughout these three years 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.000
 two years and a peak that I have been uploading 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.250
 videos I've made in all videos worth 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 and let's see what its most use 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.370
 frequent 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.130
 mainly in the boxes in the boxes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 same with the ones we breathe and the boxes 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.150
 that we do not breathe those out 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 then, it's mainly when 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.950
 we make fast rhythms it is better to use a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.720
 box like what kind of box and save in 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.600
 a more classic portal that are the boxes 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.470
 of these is worth as for example we have 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.470
 the first one that is going to be 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.740
 Y 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.960
 is here but inward and we put 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.460
 the tongue between the paddles above and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:22.660
 what goes on the sides of the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:25.090
 language something like that then we would have a 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:32.700
 derived from that which is the same but without 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.700
 tongue or tongue with tongue 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.770
 how is this second box made of how 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.770
 make a layer in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 things 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:02:01.190
 this house serves mostly for rhythm 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:04.370
 fast or for example then those two 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.110
 houses are to make you take air then 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.600
 we have another box to take air but 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.459
 to tell us that the plane 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.459
 that would be the central tea of ​​the channel 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.910
 ok this box is a p 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.960
 but inward striking with the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:38.580
 lips the stronger we hit 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:40.500
 inwards more sounds worth is a box 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.130
 very strong and very good to drink a lot 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 air 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.590
 then we have a neutral box that would be 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.590
 the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.870
 OK 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.230
 This is a finer softer box for 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.860
 the very finest more melodic is worth and is 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.909
 a 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.909
 but out 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.790
 and the blow with the palate with the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.950
 part of the palate above but the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.950
 final part where the throat is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.270
 that would be our third box later 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.270
 we have another box that would be typical 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:51.140
 and it 's with you you're in the ugliest box 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.060
 personally then we have the box 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.060
 normal that would be the pdf 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:05.750
 at once 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.750
 as if you will slide one lip over another 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:20.400
 something like that is a more real box and then 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.490
 we have another box out there that is not 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:31.819
 exactly 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:34.490
 box as such that is the bong el bongo 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.660
 it's hard to explain why why 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.700
 why will the combination of two 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.600
 techniques would be a 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.600
 I 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.919
 or not 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.070
 but with the throat 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:01.370
 but more further back to say it some 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.370
 way here the blow we give with this 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.560
 and then we have if you do not forget any 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.449
 let's see we would have the boxes there 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.550
 a box that I personally do not 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.030
 never but I learned it by chance that 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.030
 it is this 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.690
 the box pretty ugly as a box 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.889
 then a if it is done with the 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.020
 Upper lip is worth and the teeth 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.020
 from above they come together and with their tongues 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.110
 ok it's a more electric and good box 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.930
 that you have to know it also for someone 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.850
 that you like the beatbox but techniques 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.919
 more techno house dance type 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.840
 box would come well ok would be putting together the 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.840
 lip teeth and pallets 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.479
 and nothing I hope that has served you and 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.190
 let's make a small generic rhythm 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.540
 Okay, I'm not going to put the tips 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.830
 activity because it 's a rhythm that I 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.990
 I'm going to invent badly is basically 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.190
 try to put practically all the 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.460
 boxes are we've seen in the 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.460
 tutorial 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.690
 it's sad so I 'm not going to put the 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.630
 types that are in boxes for example 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.370
 you can start with this one with my 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.370
 enter continue with a 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.790
 for example if I can not think of anything else 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.320
 and nothing I hope you liked 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.210
 all new users that you have 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.160
 subscribed thank you very much 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.290
 we will continue uploading tutorials I will follow 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.360
 making direct vouchers for questions 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.710
 doubts and to know a little better 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.480
 you can ask what you want the 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.650
 direct you already know they are usually from 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.120
 beatbox but you can ask my chair 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.950
 and nothing I hope you liked that you 

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.800
 it has served that you take it into practice 

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:57.050
 and it's good that the beatbox finally ended 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.720
 he thought to share all that goes up and 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:03.630
 If so, why do you put me 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.630
 by private or in response to videos 

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:10.030
 then nothing doubts the asc 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.630
 comment so I hope you take care and 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.630
 alberche
