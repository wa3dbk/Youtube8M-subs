00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.450 
okay so we've come to the end of the
episode<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:44.080> think<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:45.009> had<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.220> bit<00:04:45.430> of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
episode and I think that had a bit of

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.610 
episode and I think that had a bit of
fun<00:04:45.550> there<00:04:45.970> as<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.660> went<00:04:46.840> towards<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.199> end<00:04:47.440> he

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
fun there as I went towards the end he

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.409 
fun there as I went towards the end he
got<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.830> bit<00:04:48.039> like<00:04:48.280> bipolar<00:04:48.789> door<00:04:49.150> what's<00:04:49.270> the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
got a bit like bipolar door what's the

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.820 
got a bit like bipolar door what's the
magnum<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.990> seemed<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.289> love<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> lot

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830
