00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello friends with you karabash 74 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.480
 Today we have such an unusual reviewer 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:25.050
 will be short too i'm still guys 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:27.900
 as promised earlier, that is, I built it like this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.099
 say your polygon to the new version of the game 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.700
 but that is, you see I have 5 4 2 15 then 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.550
 there is a incentive version here is a license 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.379
 generally we look 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:50.280
 play network game works network card 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:55.640
 We look here our polygon more precisely my well 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 our my what the difference go 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.990
 Now I learned the guys as not what I learned 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.409
 I spent almost all night today 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.250
 your precious time 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.759
 so I saw how and why we can not 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 had to embed their cards into the game 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.530
 today I will arrange stream it will be so 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.600
 say no big bomb that is me 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.720
 tell it live like this 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.960
 do as your card without problems 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.990
 shove the new version of the game that is 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.710
 you don't need no new editor 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.179
 on this editor you can do everything and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.580
 don't do anything like that 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.649
 I spent a lot of time 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.770
 let's take a ride right away 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:58.479
 I confirm that this is a license here at 1 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:02.450
 check the crows crows flew 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.560
 wonderful well yes i am still in this 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.510
 zone, let me protect tobins and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.629
 platform firm flasher lighting 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.239
 works great the fact is that 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.540
 I just did not find a person with 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.099
 which I could play now and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.380
 check that is indicative of you 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.940
 but I think that in the late afternoon we 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.790
 find a man I throw off I throw off now 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.580
 card that is, I will explain how to stream 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.040
 do it and some of you download 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.730
 and we will try to play together 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 proving ground here I i think i'm not in vain 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.430
 killed time that is nobody this anywhere 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.810
 told and I will tell you today how 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.680
 do everything as yours 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.050
 so to speak, I defended myself roughly 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.050
 I did not crack this protection I just myself 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:09.850
 sat brain think that is what 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:12.250
 but he changed it early or in body 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.700
 sat brain poraskinul because 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:20.170
 oberyn 2 I have no problems on the license 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:24.570
 walked and so I compared the facts so to speak 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.630
 and everything worked great by the way 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.720
 polygon a little redone I today 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:42.160
