00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you have to think the floyd mayweather

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109

jr.<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.770> hand-picked<00:01:17.250> Avigdor<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> tease<00:01:18.090> for

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
this fight it seems to be the kind of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
this fight it seems to be the kind of
guy<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.189> mayweather<00:01:20.700> likes<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> fight<00:01:21.330> these

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
guy that mayweather likes to fight these

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.670 
guy that mayweather likes to fight these
days<00:01:22.400> Marquez<00:01:23.400> Hatton<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.299> Ortiz<00:01:24.689> smaller

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
days Marquez Hatton and I Ortiz smaller

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
days Marquez Hatton and I Ortiz smaller
body<00:01:26.400> punchers<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.180> come<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> kill

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
body punchers that come in for the kill

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.749 
body punchers that come in for the kill
and<00:01:28.170> Mayweather<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> pick<00:01:29.040> him<00:01:29.189> off<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.579> they

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and Mayweather can pick him off as they

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
and Mayweather can pick him off as they
come<00:01:29.970> inside<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.259> never<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> against<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
come inside you can never go against the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
come inside you can never go against the
defensive<00:01:32.579> fighter<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.540> Mayweather<00:01:33.689> was

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
defensive fighter I think Mayweather was

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
defensive fighter I think Mayweather was
hand<00:01:34.170> picked<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.470> fight<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.040> he<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
hand picked this fight so that he can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.310 
hand picked this fight so that he can
just<00:01:35.549> control<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> fight<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> young

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just control the fight have the young

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
just control the fight have the young
man<00:01:37.530> come<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:37.950> him<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:38.729> he<00:01:39.270> will

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
man come at him and I think he will

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
man come at him and I think he will
eventually<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> knockout<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.130> he

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
eventually get the knockout just like he

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.859 
eventually get the knockout just like he
did<00:01:41.340> against<00:01:41.640> Ricky<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.329> he<00:01:42.450> almost<00:01:42.600> did

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
did against Ricky and like he almost did

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.499 
did against Ricky and like he almost did
against<00:01:43.170> Marquez<00:01:43.770> now<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.700> does<00:01:44.909> Ortiz<00:01:45.299> have

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
against Marquez now what does Ortiz have

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
against Marquez now what does Ortiz have
he<00:01:46.079> seems<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.470> shown<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.070> heart

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
