00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.450

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.069
 how long is the acrobatic I 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 we practice the discipline since 8 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.500
 years and I practice the academy is for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.500
 everyone 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 this is the academy where I pass 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.009
 so long but the truth is that it is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 super pretty then i love being 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:29.520
 here we also see some of the trophies 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.670
 and you see that the paintings are amazing 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.620
 I love these are lauro and patricia 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.300
 montero who were the pioneers in this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.129
 discipline 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 for this video of needing skill 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.320
 of the great companions of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.530
 dance 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.880
 and what is the acrobatic dance? 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 new creation takes two points 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.190
 important dance and acrobatics 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.870
 combines movement art technique 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 of dance with the mechanism of 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 precision of creation 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.309
 that is, dancing are linked 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 acrobatic movements thanks and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.330
 this is very much more expectations in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.220
 the dance part 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.590
 we work bar exercises that we 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.110
 they contribute the technique like stretching a foot 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.110
 how to put on the lion and not deny things 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.900
 center exercises that can be 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.300
 floor or up to control our 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 axis and spend everything worked in the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.570
 bar 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.689
 besides this we practice different 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.610
 dance styles from jazz to something 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.680
 more contemporary more urban with 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.230
 different styles of movement there 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.750
 so many 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.890
 the turns are perfect in the field of 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 a dancer and we also work 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.600
 in fact I most want to be time and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.600
 spin and spin and spin and spin 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.860
 to the dance you can add elements 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.860
 like the ropes 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 the jumps are also super important 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.510
 for any dance style 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.490
 the empty clack we also worked on it 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.370
 so that later we can combine it with 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.440
 dancing and putting it our goal is 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 be able to dance the probation and not leave 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.849
 in a very arrogant way 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.409
 well a dance acrobatics that gives 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.250
 much more spectacular in the 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.250

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.520

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.670
