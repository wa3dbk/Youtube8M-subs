00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.210
 so now tell you how to put 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.870
 krutilki at highline it opens 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:22.939
 the original were ordinary 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:29.310
 without shining such Lansky us 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.050
 such with sparkles immediately that they are not 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.860
 fit 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 this climate is the width of these here and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 snaps that we actually will now 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:54.239
 do so remove our lap circle 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:57.120
 this way the plaque so we need 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.660
 do to put these chrome 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660
 krutilki 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.100
 the distance here it is and in the distance 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.259
 she here less on snaps about climate 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.390
 confusion 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.060
 we will need to sharpen the edges 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:28.860
 so that they are already like cherries and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 bottom latch is a hit uid spirit she is with us 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.270
 became mine 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.140
 our 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:59.810
 here are the differences original oh online a and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.810
 open on the spinner 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.030
 will drive the same principle does not put 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:30.890
 slightly different mount so round 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.300
 many put the replacement of the original 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.820
 chrome dutch to become a circle and to whom 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.830
 as you like but I think that all the same 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.670
 What is better than to round answers 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.690
 unambiguous 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.430
 and looks more beautiful and generally super but 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.650
 Highland of course I also like it very much 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.990
 who try to put them high 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.150
 lina 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.420
 it seems the latch itself 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.420
 fits perfect 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:27.150
 all choice so now i sharpened 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:31.870
 then the man side 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.790
 approximately to stiffeners to approximately 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.230
 I asked these stiffeners 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.569
 Well, then you need less when writing off 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.830
 which is wider but it is less possible 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.620
 we need to grind but these 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.069
 which is thinner and should be about 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:04:15.700
 ribs 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:04:20.459
 grind to snap you like 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.080
 It became honest of course how it rotates with 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.710
 a little jam on the Russian became 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.750
 warp it is perfect they don't fit all 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:37.620
 Equally teaches she will break somewhere 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:46.330
 of course I didnâ€™t know 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:49.080
 It turned out to be skewed which is utilitarian 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.080
 became the ideal 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.700
 it is also slightly skewed and is
