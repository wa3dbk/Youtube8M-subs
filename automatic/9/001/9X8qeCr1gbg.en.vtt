00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 recipe 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 geovanni already gave a road accuses 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 could be made to train to hit 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.160

 I put the egg here and I put it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 half as you said at the beginning of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.430
 program is the revenue is too large to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.350
 divided people will divide the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 ingredients in this case is small 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 who is doing at home can go out 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.489
 half of all to make a minor mood 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.100
 so you put half the eggs here 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.680
 17 eggs and mail is because they are who they are and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.079
 you can put only 7 have no problem 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.110
 half the soybean oil half the oil 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110
 Soy 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.680
 this subject goes all because here already 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.070
 half of your favor is exactly 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.420
 half such sugar 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.369
 because half of the cheese is already 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 For us, the parliamentarian of the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.530
 Funny looks like a piece of cheese 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.020
 but that is the way it has increased 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 that gave only half now if it goes 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.490
 beat this up all in the blender 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 then hit the other half left 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.110
 for us to continue to continue 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 Let's see, we'll hit the others. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.130
 ingredients in a minute shows 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 how will they stay now if they want 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 mix all this brasilia that now 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.090
 already put those ingredients eyes on 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.780
 in a separate vessel is placing it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.549
 here first the powdered milk 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.009
 Now tell me you said that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 your grandmother's traditional recipe 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.149
 under the motto at night you can hear I got going 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.549
 to uncover secrets is because the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.890
 next is the past time we did 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.710
 a change it there after the milk 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.319
 publicly known as Cobra was the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.690
 normal cow's milk haiti a little 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.150
 less than 40 there 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.980
 was a more detailed taste and was 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.750
 creamy and add powdered milk 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.480
 I have woman treating an improvement. 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.670
 not improving the recipe ended up explaining 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.400
 any milk also explain that 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.440
 You use qe2 kubaski, this is the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.450
 coarsest guinea-pig cornmeal 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.250
 thicker than the other time when the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.020
 fighter with the firmer jica more 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.760
 thin consistency during a flour 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.210
 of wheat and so we think that the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.420
 supermarket goodwill of canjica or to change 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.470
 then I will put too right 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.720
 o the cornmeal is finer are two of the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.290
 lights a slightly larger amount 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.180

 I'm going to put the wheat flour and now 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.900
 finally closing the baking powder 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.820
 place over the flour and açaí and 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.470
 what is the next step 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.670
 The next step is to take those 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.160
 ingredients to hit 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.380
 here are were well liquids is well and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.600
 put itself there by gradually putting this 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.390
 The team may have filed the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.900
 can put half that whole half 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.370
 here you can say it all 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.380
 now you have to put your hand in the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 now hand in the dough and have some secret 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.750

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.650
 after he had already had a point here 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.850
 Then half the batter was stirring. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.850
