carburetor on any engine that has one is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.750 
carburetor on any engine that has one is
to<00:00:36.149> blend<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.780> fuel<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.410> outside<00:00:38.010> air<00:00:38.430> into

to blend the fuel with outside air into

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.690 
to blend the fuel with outside air into
a<00:00:39.120> perfect<00:00:40.050> mixture<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:40.980> regulate<00:00:41.370> its

let's<00:00:45.300> start<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.809> tip<00:00:46.110> by<00:00:46.350> taking<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> tour<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
let's start this tip by taking a tour of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.990 
let's start this tip by taking a tour of
the<00:00:47.460> carburetor<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.770> float<00:00:50.010> Bowl<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the carburetor this is the float Bowl it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479 
the carburetor this is the float Bowl it
has<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> hose<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.840> brings<00:00:52.500> fuel<00:00:52.949> directly

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
has a hose that brings fuel directly

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
has a hose that brings fuel directly
from<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> fuel<00:00:54.329> tanks<00:00:54.949> inside<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
from the fuel tanks inside there is a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.150 
from the fuel tanks inside there is a
float<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.239> stops<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.199> flow<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> bowl

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
float that stops the flow when the bowl

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.729 
float that stops the flow when the bowl
is<00:00:59.460> full<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> same<00:01:01.079> technology<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is full this is the same technology that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
is full this is the same technology that
prevents<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.460> toilet<00:01:02.879> bowl<00:01:03.030> from

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
prevents your toilet bowl from

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.560 
prevents your toilet bowl from
overflowing<00:01:04.049> once<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.559> full<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> once<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
overflowing once it's full so once the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.750 
overflowing once it's full so once the
fuel<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> bowl<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.950> fed<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
fuel is in the bowl it is fed to the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
fuel is in the bowl it is fed to the
discharge<00:01:09.360> nozzle<00:01:09.630> where<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.590> mixed

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
discharge nozzle where it will be mixed

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
discharge nozzle where it will be mixed
with<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> outside<00:01:11.880> air<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.360> vaporized<00:01:12.960> for

engine consumption the flow of fuel here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
engine consumption the flow of fuel here
is<00:01:16.500> regulated<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> mixture<00:01:17.909> needle<00:01:18.299> it's
