00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.830
 same 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.539
 hello how about friends and welcome to what 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.160
 What is this new video like you already know? 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.480
 I am david zÃ¡ccaro and good in this 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.520
 chance let's see something a little 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.560
 different that will be like us 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.660
 we can change the functions of the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.550
 buttons of our pcp in this case is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.919
 a slim psp since I'm occupying is a 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.160
 pcp that I recently found again 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.690
 and with the novelty that it no longer worked 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.850
 the start button does not then the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.770
 sending it to repair is expensive then what 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.180
 we will do if we do not 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.610
 We can repair good by sending it to 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.500
 repair yes it is clear that good then 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.570
 what can we do then 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.579
 let's change the function we're not going this 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.590
 button that if we never take good care of 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.450
 least most people or at least me 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.280
 did not occupy it then what are you going to do 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.500
 is that the start button broke down 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.950
 Well now I'm going to tell you that this is 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.300
 button of the note that is to be not 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.730
 the same will work for you if you broke the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.460
 cnt for being the game or if you 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.619
 decomposed the volume one I change it is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.299
 why this is why you like it here 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.530
 I have teach how to do it I hope you 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.049
 like the video something I want to clarify 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.340
 is that we're not going to absolutely anything 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.400
 programs we are not going to modify 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.250
 absolutely nothing 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.840
 what are pcpe files are we going to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 modify a file in a folder that 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.720
 I'll pass the download link ok 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 this folder does not weigh anything I do not know then 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.030
 then you download it already and well what 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.560
 decompresses it is clear once you des 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.840
 commitment is going to leave a folder 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.480
 call makes plugins open and good 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.570
 those files come out we're not going to 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.240
 this case to rimar ine 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.370
 and what are we going to do here good and we're going to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.650
 open also what is in this case the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.510
 first is what we are going to do here 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.250
 good so that's an easy way to 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.190
 understand it and do not miss out on what 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.560
 are the buttons in this in this the real 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.080
 button is going to be the new button not the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.869
 new button that is the note that does not go 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.940
 to be the new start button and that in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.310
 this case I will not replace it good 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.230
 it's going to be the one to be not if you want 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.990
 replace the good hong put com if 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.700
 wants to replace the one in the X 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.209
 well you put in this case the value of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.640
 x but in this case it is not being very 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.120
 ok then remember here new button 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.130
 and the old ok button now we're going to go 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.900
