this is just engineer and to start off
I'm<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:15.839> through<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.230> weapons

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
in this class and here we have the 989

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.970 
in this class and here we have the 989
one<00:00:19.439> AB<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:20.279> move<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.699> answer<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> says<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
one AB to move that answer that says and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.560 
one AB to move that answer that says and
I<00:00:22.980> switch<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> scar<00:00:23.670> l<00:00:23.789> because<00:00:24.119> these<00:00:24.300> two

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
I switch to the scar l because these two

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.810 
I switch to the scar l because these two
have<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> exact<00:00:25.470> same<00:00:25.830> stats<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.490> noticed

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
have the exact same stats if you noticed

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.359 
have the exact same stats if you noticed
the<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.900> thing<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.619> found<00:00:28.920> those<00:00:29.220> that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the one thing that I found those that

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040 
the one thing that I found those that
the<00:00:29.460> scar<00:00:29.820> seems<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.420> slightly<00:00:30.810> less

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the scar seems to have slightly less

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.260 
the scar seems to have slightly less
recoil<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.650> we'll<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.460> yeah

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
recoil but we'll get to that but yeah

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.200 
recoil but we'll get to that but yeah
see<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> exact<00:00:34.260> same<00:00:34.469> set<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> exit

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
see that the exact same set now the exit

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.319 
see that the exact same set now the exit
made<00:00:36.360> compact<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> higher<00:00:39.000> rate<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
made compact but it has a higher rate of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.470 
made compact but it has a higher rate of
fire<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.050> slightly<00:00:40.530> less<00:00:40.890> accuracy<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:42.360> if

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
fire but slightly less accuracy now if

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
fire but slightly less accuracy now if
you're<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> hardcore<00:00:42.960> fan<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.190> could

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you're a hardcore fan like me this could

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
you're a hardcore fan like me this could
be<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.600> help<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.079> rate

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
be a lot like a lot of help because rate

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.110 
be a lot like a lot of help because rate
of<00:00:46.500> fire<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.920> huge<00:00:47.309> thing<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.719> 74<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
of fire is a huge thing and in 74 you

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.080 
of fire is a huge thing and in 74 you
aks-74u<00:00:51.120> Chris<00:00:51.660> konov<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> um

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
aks-74u Chris konov actually is um

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
aks-74u Chris konov actually is um
they're<00:00:54.090> probably<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.480> best<00:00:54.719> SMG<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.920> mean

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
they're probably the best SMG is I mean

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
they're probably the best SMG is I mean
it's<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.309> strongest<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.910> stuff<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.600> easy

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it's as strongest and stuff and the easy

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's as strongest and stuff and the easy
has<00:00:58.109> an<00:00:58.230> extremely<00:00:58.530> high<00:00:58.739> rate<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> fire<00:00:59.070> but

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
has an extremely high rate of fire but

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
has an extremely high rate of fire but
low<00:00:59.640> damage<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.180> low<00:01:00.270> accuracy<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
low damage and low accuracy and as you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
low damage and low accuracy and as you
can<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.520> damaged<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> accuracy<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
can see it's damaged and accuracy is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
can see it's damaged and accuracy is
lower<00:01:03.780> than<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> original<00:01:04.500> SMG<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> get

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
lower than the original SMG that you get

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.420 
lower than the original SMG that you get
but<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> rate<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> pie<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.970> ridiculous

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
but the rate of pie is ridiculous

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
but the rate of pie is ridiculous
however<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.540> since<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> week<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.990> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
however that since the week is kind of a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
however that since the week is kind of a
thing<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.430> don't<00:01:11.700> want<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.780> with

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
thing like you don't want that say with

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
thing like you don't want that say with
the<00:01:13.020> pp-2000<00:01:13.830> rate<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> fire<00:01:14.310> like

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the pp-2000 rate of fire like

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
the pp-2000 rate of fire like
off-the-charts<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.110> weak<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
off-the-charts but it's so weak and so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
off-the-charts but it's so weak and so
inaccurate<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.509> recommend

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
inaccurate I really don't recommend

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
inaccurate I really don't recommend
using<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:21.990> saying<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.500> 70

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
using it and so like I'm saying the 70

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.030 
using it and so like I'm saying the 70
for<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.299> lot<00:01:24.810> better<00:01:25.470> than<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> other

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
for you is a lot better than the other

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
for you is a lot better than the other
ones<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> mean<00:01:27.090> technically<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
ones of the mean technically it's the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.429 
ones of the mean technically it's the
same<00:01:28.590> damage<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.659> original<00:01:30.990> ones<00:01:31.200> but

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
same damage but as the original ones but

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
same damage but as the original ones but
the<00:01:31.680> increase<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> accuracy<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.299> rate<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the increase in accuracy and rate of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.890 
the increase in accuracy and rate of
fire<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.960> huge<00:01:34.409> help<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> ump45

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
fire is a huge help and the ump45

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
fire is a huge help and the ump45
although<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.740> unlocked<00:01:38.250> yet<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.729> have

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
although I have not unlocked yet I have

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
although I have not unlocked yet I have
read<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> exact<00:01:40.229> same<00:01:40.470> stats<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
read that is the exact same stats as the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
read that is the exact same stats as the
aks-74u<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> yeah<00:01:44.850> moving<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> gadgets<00:01:45.780> for

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
aks-74u so yeah moving on to gadgets for

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
aks-74u so yeah moving on to gadgets for
the<00:01:46.380> engineer<00:01:46.710> class<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> drill<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the engineer class you get a drill to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
the engineer class you get a drill to
heal<00:01:48.119> things<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> big<00:01:49.770> vehicle

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
heal things so if you're a big vehicle

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.859 
heal things so if you're a big vehicle
driver<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.119> an<00:01:51.240> ideal<00:01:51.390> class

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
driver this would be an ideal class

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
driver this would be an ideal class
because<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.530> back<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.520> heal<00:01:53.670> if

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because you can just back up and heal if

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.660 
because you can just back up and heal if
you<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.060> shot<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.380> you're<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.649> an<00:01:55.740> RPG<00:01:56.340> at

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you get shot out and you're in an RPG at

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
you get shot out and you're in an RPG at
the<00:01:57.390> beginning<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:57.930> after<00:01:58.110> why<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> unlock

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the beginning but after why you unlock

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880 
the beginning but after why you unlock
the<00:01:59.520> call<00:02:00.299> Gustav<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> slightly<00:02:01.560> better

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the call Gustav which is slightly better

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
the call Gustav which is slightly better
but<00:02:02.329> I<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:03.570> really<00:02:03.659> see<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> difference<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
but I don't really see a difference and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
but I don't really see a difference and
then<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> 84<00:02:05.369> which<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.850> like

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
then you get the 84 which you can like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
then you get the 84 which you can like
track<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> right<00:02:07.649> stick<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> just

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
track with the right stick you can just

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.089 
track with the right stick you can just
point<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> where<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> want<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.890> also

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
point to where you want to go you also

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.570 
point to where you want to go you also
get<00:02:11.220> an<00:02:11.310> eight<00:02:11.430> anti-tank<00:02:12.030> mine

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
get an eight anti-tank mine

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.670 
get an eight anti-tank mine
I don't<00:02:12.850> really<00:02:12.940> recommend<00:02:13.210> those<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.560> then

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
I don't really recommend those and then

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.500 
I don't really recommend those and then
you<00:02:14.830> with<00:02:15.550> your<00:02:15.640> tassels<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.240> red

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
you with your tassels you can have red

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.060 
you with your tassels you can have red
dot<00:02:16.720> sight<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.760> ACOG<00:02:18.760> scope<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.860> then<00:02:20.860> there's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
dot sight in ACOG scope and then there's

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.410 
dot sight in ACOG scope and then there's
something<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.460> increases<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.060> accuracy

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
something that increases the accuracy

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.110 
something that increases the accuracy
and<00:02:23.130> all<00:02:24.130> these<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.430> use<00:02:24.580> phone<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.000> be

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
and all these we use phone that can be

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.450 
and all these we use phone that can be
used<00:02:25.210> on<00:02:25.300> all<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> SMGs<00:02:26.110> once<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.560> unlocked<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
used on all the SMGs once is unlocked so

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.480 
used on all the SMGs once is unlocked so
yeah<00:02:27.580> let's<00:02:27.910> see<00:02:28.060> some<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.360> them<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.540> action<00:02:29.490> so

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
yeah let's see some of them in action so

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.010 
yeah let's see some of them in action so
just<00:02:31.000> sort<00:02:31.180> off<00:02:31.330> we're<00:02:31.450> going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.720> the

we're<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.800> trying<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> show<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.340> rate

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
we're just trying to show you the rate

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.170 
we're just trying to show you the rate
of<00:02:54.490> fire<00:02:54.760> like<00:02:55.600> recoil<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.170> stuff<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.650> don't

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
of fire like recoil and stuff so don't

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.300 
of fire like recoil and stuff so don't
be<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.300> oh<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.450> suck<00:02:58.780> at<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.990> game<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.950> yeah

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
be like oh you suck at the game so yeah

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.650 
be like oh you suck at the game so yeah
this<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.730> rate<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:00.910> fire<00:03:01.150> as<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.510> see

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
this is the rate of fire as you can see

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.390 
this is the rate of fire as you can see
it's<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:02.080> high<00:03:02.230> but<00:03:02.470> not<00:03:02.650> too<00:03:02.890> high<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.310> has

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
it's it's high but not too high and has

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.270 
it's it's high but not too high and has
a<00:03:03.459> pretty<00:03:03.880> high<00:03:04.000> amount<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.480> recoil<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.280> so

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
a pretty high amount of recoil and so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.970 
a pretty high amount of recoil and so
this<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.209> decent<00:03:07.450> SMG<00:03:08.020> for<00:03:08.350> getting<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
this is a decent SMG for getting it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.010 
this is a decent SMG for getting it
right<00:03:09.100> off<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.310> bat<00:03:09.490> but<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:10.630> can<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.870> better

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
right off the bat but you can do better

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.340 
right off the bat but you can do better
next<00:03:11.410> I'll<00:03:11.590> do<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.770> scar<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.810> scar<00:03:14.140> is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
next I'll do the scar and so the scar is

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.670 
next I'll do the scar and so the scar is
like<00:03:15.150> pretty<00:03:16.150> much<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> exact<00:03:16.900> same<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:17.560> like

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
like pretty much the exact same but like

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620 
like pretty much the exact same but like
I<00:03:17.769> said<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.340> feel<00:03:18.550> like<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> slightly<00:03:19.300> less

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
I said it I feel like it a slightly less

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.410 
I said it I feel like it a slightly less
recoil<00:03:19.870> which<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.769> see<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.519> we<00:03:22.030> use<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.269> red

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
recoil which will see and we use the red

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.670 
recoil which will see and we use the red
dot<00:03:22.630> sight<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.019> time<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.320> show<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.590> what

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
dot sight of this time to show you what

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.770 
dot sight of this time to show you what
that's<00:03:23.800> like<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:25.090> pretty<00:03:25.300> much<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.480> like

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
that's like it's pretty much just like

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.560 
that's like it's pretty much just like
the<00:03:25.870> call<00:03:26.019> of<00:03:26.110> duty<00:03:26.380> one<00:03:26.560> except<00:03:27.239> it's<00:03:28.239> around

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
the call of duty one except it's around

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.020 
the call of duty one except it's around
and<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.950> see<00:03:30.100> it's<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.310> same<00:03:30.489> rate<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.880> fire

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
and you see it's the same rate of fire

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.910 
and you see it's the same rate of fire
but<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.989> also<00:03:32.140> may<00:03:32.230> like<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.500> slightly

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
but if you also may like it a slightly

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.770 
but if you also may like it a slightly
less<00:03:33.160> recoil<00:03:33.370> tell<00:03:33.820> me<00:03:33.880> what<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.090> think<00:03:34.120> and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
less recoil tell me what you think and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.449 
less recoil tell me what you think and
times<00:03:35.110> when<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.380> prefer<00:03:35.709> for<00:03:35.950> this<00:03:36.070> whip<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
times when you prefer for this whip you

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.840 
times when you prefer for this whip you
play<00:03:36.880> backup<00:03:37.300> my<00:03:37.420> two<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:38.550> yeah<00:03:39.550> I'm<00:03:39.640> going<00:03:39.790> to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
play backup my two and yeah I'm going to

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.460 
play backup my two and yeah I'm going to
do<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> xm8<00:03:40.600> compact<00:03:41.350> next<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.840> yeah<00:03:44.230> there's

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
do the xm8 compact next so yeah there's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.890 
do the xm8 compact next so yeah there's
not<00:03:44.709> much<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.160> say<00:03:45.430> here<00:03:45.700> besides<00:03:46.209> ex-inmate

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
not much to say here besides ex-inmate

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.190 
not much to say here besides ex-inmate
it<00:03:47.470> has<00:03:48.070> slight<00:03:48.400> less<00:03:48.610> accuracy<00:03:49.030> but<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.570> don't

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
it has slight less accuracy but I don't

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.130 
it has slight less accuracy but I don't
think<00:03:50.320> it's<00:03:50.440> noticeable<00:03:50.800> at<00:03:50.920> all<00:03:50.950> same<00:03:51.580> damage

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
think it's noticeable at all same damage

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.199 
think it's noticeable at all same damage
but<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.440> rate<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.650> fire<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.100> much<00:03:54.760> much<00:03:55.000> higher

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
but the rate of fire is much much higher

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.830 
but the rate of fire is much much higher
as<00:03:55.600> you'll<00:03:55.840> see<00:03:55.989> right<00:03:56.080> here<00:03:56.970> that's<00:03:57.970> much

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
as you'll see right here that's much

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.759 
as you'll see right here that's much
higher<00:03:59.110> and<00:04:01.050> so<00:04:02.050> yeah<00:04:02.200> there's<00:04:02.410> not<00:04:02.530> much<00:04:02.680> to

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
higher and so yeah there's not much to

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.620 
higher and so yeah there's not much to
say<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.400> high<00:04:03.640> rate<00:04:03.850> of<00:04:03.880> fire<00:04:04.000> slightly<00:04:04.540> less

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
say just high rate of fire slightly less

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.810 
say just high rate of fire slightly less
accurate<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.290> not<00:04:05.410> noticeable<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
accurate but it's not noticeable so the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.210 
accurate but it's not noticeable so the
aks-74u<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:10.330> probably<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.140> best<00:04:11.350> SMG<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:12.100> you

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
aks-74u is probably the best SMG in you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.610 
aks-74u is probably the best SMG in you
besides<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.760> ump45<00:04:13.299> which<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:13.989> exactly<00:04:14.260> the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
besides the ump45 which is exactly the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.750 
besides the ump45 which is exactly the
same<00:04:14.830> thing<00:04:15.070> pretty<00:04:15.310> much<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:16.169> as<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.950> slightly

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
same thing pretty much and as a slightly

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.000 
same thing pretty much and as a slightly
lower<00:04:19.030> rate<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:19.299> fire<00:04:19.540> than<00:04:19.720> xm8<00:04:20.200> compact<00:04:20.770> but

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
lower rate of fire than xm8 compact but

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.210 
lower rate of fire than xm8 compact but
higher<00:04:21.250> than<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:21.640> scar<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.720> nine

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
higher than the scar and the nine

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.390 
higher than the scar and the nine
91<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.630> so<00:04:25.320> that's<00:04:25.530> hopeful<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:26.160> no<00:04:26.280> idea

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
91 and so that's hopeful I have no idea

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.030 
91 and so that's hopeful I have no idea
why<00:04:26.580> have<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.820> 84<00:04:27.330> out<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:28.920> the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
why have the 84 out and so this is the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.000 
why have the 84 out and so this is the
rate<00:04:29.160> of<00:04:29.190> fire<00:04:29.570> but<00:04:30.570> its<00:04:31.050> accuracy<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.830> much

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
rate of fire but its accuracy is much

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.680 
rate of fire but its accuracy is much
higher<00:04:32.220> than<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.670> first<00:04:32.940> then<00:04:33.270> all<00:04:33.420> of<00:04:33.450> them

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
higher than the first then all of them

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330 
higher than the first then all of them
pretty<00:04:33.900> much<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.380> it's<00:04:34.650> damage<00:04:35.040> is<00:04:35.160> higher

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
pretty much and it's damage is higher

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.720 
pretty much and it's damage is higher
than<00:04:35.520> all<00:04:35.640> them<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.460> really<00:04:38.610> just

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
than all them and so this is really just

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.340 
than all them and so this is really just
the<00:04:38.880> best<00:04:39.270> all-around<00:04:39.630> SMG<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:42.200> now<00:04:43.200> we<00:04:43.260> have

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the best all-around SMG and now we have

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.170 
the best all-around SMG and now we have
the<00:04:43.530> mini<00:04:43.740> uz<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.760> honestly<00:04:45.060> don't

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
the mini uz and I honestly don't

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.640 
the mini uz and I honestly don't
recommend<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.780> gun<00:04:46.020> even<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.470> you're<00:04:46.590> a

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
recommend this gun even if you're a

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.520 
recommend this gun even if you're a
hardcore<00:04:46.890> fan<00:04:47.480> its<00:04:48.480> damage<00:04:48.990> is<00:04:49.110> lower<00:04:49.320> than

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
hardcore fan its damage is lower than

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.620 
hardcore fan its damage is lower than
all<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.770> other<00:04:49.920> ones<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.430> believe<00:04:51.060> i'm<00:04:51.480> not

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
all the other ones I believe i'm not

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.050 
all the other ones I believe i'm not
positive<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.230> don't<00:04:52.410> quote<00:04:52.530> me<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:53.060> let's

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
positive so don't quote me on that let's

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
positive so don't quote me on that let's
go<00:04:54.180> back<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.510> beginning<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.900> see<00:04:55.050> the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
go back to the beginning to see the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.230 
go back to the beginning to see the
damage<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.470> stuff<00:04:55.680> but<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.100> accuracy<00:04:56.910> is<00:04:56.940> much

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
damage of stuff but the accuracy is much

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.910 
damage of stuff but the accuracy is much
lower<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.990> rate<00:04:58.260> of<00:04:58.290> fire<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:58.530> really

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
lower and the rate of fire is really

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.040 
lower and the rate of fire is really
high<00:04:59.070> so<00:05:00.000> although<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.480> rate<00:05:00.630> of<00:05:00.660> fire<00:05:00.840> side

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
high so although the rate of fire side

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.560 
high so although the rate of fire side
the<00:05:01.260> accuracy<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.890> damage<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.570> decrease

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
the accuracy and the damage in decrease

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.140 
the accuracy and the damage in decrease
is<00:05:03.810> actually<00:05:04.770> very<00:05:04.800> noticeable<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:05.790> don't

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
is actually very noticeable so I don't

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.620 
is actually very noticeable so I don't
recommend<00:05:06.420> this<00:05:06.630> gun<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:08.760> PPG<00:05:09.060> thousands

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
recommend this gun and the PPG thousands

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.240 
recommend this gun and the PPG thousands
pretty<00:05:09.810> much<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.050> exact<00:05:10.380> same<00:05:10.590> way<00:05:10.830> for<00:05:10.890> some

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
pretty much the exact same way for some

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.710 
pretty much the exact same way for some
reason<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:11.550> got<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:11.700> really<00:05:11.880> bad<00:05:12.090> clip<00:05:12.390> of<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.660> I

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
reason I got a really bad clip of it I

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.440 
reason I got a really bad clip of it I
barely<00:05:13.020> fire<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.590> at<00:05:13.650> all<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.520> is<00:05:14.700> the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
barely fire it at all but this is the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.540 
barely fire it at all but this is the
best<00:05:15.600> i<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:15.780> sorry<00:05:16.260> but<00:05:16.980> I'm<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.220> gun<00:05:17.400> I

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
best i have sorry but I'm this gun I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.040 
best i have sorry but I'm this gun I
honestly<00:05:17.910> think<00:05:18.060> it's<00:05:18.150> terrible<00:05:18.630> but<00:05:18.840> that's

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
honestly think it's terrible but that's

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.320 
honestly think it's terrible but that's
just<00:05:19.230> my<00:05:19.470> opinion<00:05:19.669> it's<00:05:20.669> just<00:05:20.940> like<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.150> many

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
just my opinion it's just like the many

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.230 
just my opinion it's just like the many
easy<00:05:21.720> but<00:05:22.560> even<00:05:22.860> worse<00:05:23.100> than<00:05:23.370> damage<00:05:23.790> and<00:05:24.090> even

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
easy but even worse than damage and even

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.480 
easy but even worse than damage and even
worse<00:05:24.510> an<00:05:24.690> accuracy<00:05:24.990> but<00:05:25.770> hasn't<00:05:26.010> even<00:05:26.070> higher

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
worse an accuracy but hasn't even higher

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.000 
worse an accuracy but hasn't even higher
fire<00:05:26.850> in<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.390> higher<00:05:27.540> rate<00:05:27.840> bars<00:05:28.080> as<00:05:28.380> big<00:05:28.830> as<00:05:28.950> I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
fire in the higher rate bars as big as I

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.800 
fire in the higher rate bars as big as I
can<00:05:29.040> get<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.400> that's<00:05:29.640> cool<00:05:30.090> actually<00:05:30.720> if

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
can get it that's cool actually if

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.340 
can get it that's cool actually if
you've<00:05:31.050> taken<00:05:31.200> good<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:32.280> yeah<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:33.169> really<00:05:34.169> don't
