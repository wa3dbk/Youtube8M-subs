00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
together the Hall of Justice I figured

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.160 
together the Hall of Justice I figured
that<00:02:40.790> would<00:02:40.910> look<00:02:41.090> really<00:02:41.330> nice<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.930> this

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
that would look really nice like this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.380 
that would look really nice like this
but<00:02:42.380> there<00:02:42.590> isn't<00:02:42.830> really<00:02:42.980> any<00:02:43.250> way<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.490> secure

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but there isn't really any way to secure

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.650 
but there isn't really any way to secure
the<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.810> cardboard<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.640> base<00:02:46.880> which

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
the the cardboard to the the base which

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.240 
the the cardboard to the the base which
I<00:02:47.810> thought<00:02:47.930> would<00:02:48.080> look<00:02:48.290> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> nice<00:02:48.740> but

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
I thought would look kind of nice but

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.780 
I thought would look kind of nice but
but<00:02:50.000> they<00:02:50.990> didn't<00:02:51.320> do<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:51.800> not<00:02:52.640> really

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
but they didn't do that so not really

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.400 
but they didn't do that so not really
sure<00:02:53.000> why<00:02:53.150> I'm<00:02:53.270> bringing<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.660> lot<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:54.110> just

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
sure why I'm bringing a lot I just

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.040 
sure why I'm bringing a lot I just
thought<00:02:54.530> it'd<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.830> nice<00:02:55.010> idea<00:02:55.840> anyway<00:02:56.840> of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
thought it'd be a nice idea anyway of

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.500 
thought it'd be a nice idea anyway of
the<00:02:57.680> young<00:02:57.830> justice<00:02:58.220> four<00:02:58.820> inch<00:02:58.940> line<00:02:59.300> of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
the young justice four inch line of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.050 
the young justice four inch line of
figures<00:03:00.040> I'm<00:03:01.040> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> take<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.459> pass<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
figures I'm going to take a pass on the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.610 
figures I'm going to take a pass on the
rest<00:03:02.240> of<00:03:02.360> these<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:02.750> really<00:03:03.410> they're<00:03:03.590> not

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
rest of these because really they're not

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.160 
rest of these because really they're not
doing<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.400> whole<00:03:04.550> lot<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:05.090> me<00:03:05.270> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
