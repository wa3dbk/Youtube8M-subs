instead<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.259> step<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:59.189> means

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
instead of back step them that means

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.039 
instead of back step them that means
that<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> give<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.270> huge<00:02:00.689> amount<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
that you give them a huge amount of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.380 
that you give them a huge amount of
damage<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.130> step<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.759> right<00:02:03.030> into<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
damage if you step them right into the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.230 
damage if you step them right into the
face<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:04.950> sure<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.030> pretty

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
face and I'm not sure it is a pretty

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
face and I'm not sure it is a pretty
good<00:02:06.450> idea<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.469> also<00:02:07.710> really

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
good idea but it can be also really

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.180 
good idea but it can be also really
overpowered<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> perhaps<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.979> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
overpowered and perhaps and it is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
overpowered and perhaps and it is
unbalanced<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.180> I'm<00:02:12.270> not<00:02:12.420> quite<00:02:12.629> sure<00:02:12.660> on

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
unbalanced but I'm not quite sure on

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.550 
unbalanced but I'm not quite sure on
that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.770 
that

weapons if you think some of these

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
weapons are really overpowered or

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.260

underpowered or if you think some of

underpowered or if you think some of
these<00:02:21.480> weapon<00:02:21.870> ideas<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.319> pretty<00:02:22.560> good<00:02:22.770> and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
these weapon ideas are pretty good and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
some of those discussions right there

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.970 
some of those discussions right there
that<00:02:27.030> would<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.270> really<00:02:27.510> amazing<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
that would be really amazing and the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.699 
that would be really amazing and the
next<00:02:29.220> weapon<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.060> soccer<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.750> pyro<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
next weapon is the soccer for pyro the

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.770 
next weapon is the soccer for pyro the
name<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.040> pretty<00:02:32.280> nice<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.239> means<00:02:33.480> it's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
name is pretty nice and that means it's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.160 
name is pretty nice and that means it's
kind<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.980> flame<00:02:35.220> flower<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:36.300> has<00:02:36.780> top

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
kind of a flame flower which has top

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920 
kind of a flame flower which has top
side<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.709> air<00:02:38.130> blasting<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.180> means<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:39.690> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
side of air blasting that means if you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.670 
side of air blasting that means if you
air<00:02:40.860> blast<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.640> will<00:02:41.849> suck<00:02:42.239> people<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.170> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
air blast you will suck people to you so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.100 
air blast you will suck people to you so
they<00:02:44.130> won't<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.819> away<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.390> your<00:02:45.600> bus<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:45.989> will

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
they won't go away if your bus they will

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.699 
they won't go away if your bus they will
come<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.799> so<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:49.019> can<00:02:49.290> move<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
come to you so you can you can move the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.160 
come to you so you can you can move the
enemies<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.220> yourself<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.090> I'm<00:02:51.780> not<00:02:51.930> sure<00:02:52.049> on

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
enemies to yourself and I'm not sure on

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.900 
enemies to yourself and I'm not sure on
that<00:02:52.200> weapon<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.799> name<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.100> really<00:02:53.310> weird<00:02:53.459> but

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
that weapon the name is really weird but

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.570 
that weapon the name is really weird but
i<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.569> even<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.870> bad<00:02:55.049> idea<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.799> i

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
i think that's not even a bad idea and i

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.860 
i think that's not even a bad idea and i
think<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.060> could<00:02:57.209> be<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.420> really<00:02:57.630> good<00:02:57.750> idea

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
think that could be a really good idea

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
think that could be a really good idea
what<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.620> think<00:02:58.709> about<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.220> sucker<00:02:59.459> for

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
what do you think about the sucker for

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.330 
what do you think about the sucker for
pyro<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.660> don't<00:03:01.470> know<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:01.920> not<00:03:02.040> really

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
pyro I don't know it's not really

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.250 
pyro I don't know it's not really
overpowered<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.060> my<00:03:03.209> opinion<00:03:03.569> perhaps<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.140> is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
overpowered in my opinion perhaps it is

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.780 
overpowered in my opinion perhaps it is
in<00:03:04.470> your<00:03:04.620> opinion<00:03:05.010> please<00:03:05.220> tell<00:03:05.400> me<00:03:05.430> why<00:03:05.730> you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
in your opinion please tell me why you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.000 
in your opinion please tell me why you
think<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.330> over<00:03:06.450> powered<00:03:06.900> or<00:03:07.230> why<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.560> think

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
think it's over powered or why you think

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.820 
think it's over powered or why you think
it's<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.970> great<00:03:09.060> weapon<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.780> next<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
it's a great weapon and the next and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.100 
it's a great weapon and the next and
last<00:03:10.890> weapon<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.970> weapon<00:03:12.239> for<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> soldier

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
last weapon is a weapon for the soldier

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.410 
last weapon is a weapon for the soldier
which<00:03:13.349> I<00:03:13.530> really<00:03:13.890> don't<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.910> would<00:03:15.330> like

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
which I really don't like I would like

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.509 
which I really don't like I would like
to<00:03:15.450> European<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.410> one<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.739> well<00:03:16.769> it's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
to European that one as well it's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.490 
to European that one as well it's
basically<00:03:18.000> called<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.570> base<00:03:18.810> jumper<00:03:19.320> which

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
basically called the base jumper which

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.380 
basically called the base jumper which
is<00:03:19.650> basically<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.190> pair<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.850> duty<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.359> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
is basically a pair of duty for the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.599 
is basically a pair of duty for the
soldier<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.140> yeah<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.160> sounds<00:03:23.370> really

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
soldier and yeah that sounds really

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.819 
soldier and yeah that sounds really
weird<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.150> think<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.780> destroys<00:03:25.560> a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
weird and I think it just destroys a

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.670 
weird and I think it just destroys a
sense<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.760> rocket<00:03:27.209> jumping<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.810> yeah<00:03:28.470> that's

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
sense of rocket jumping and yeah that's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.800 
sense of rocket jumping and yeah that's
why<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.950> don't<00:03:29.489> really<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.510> wealth

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
why I don't really like it but wealth

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.530 
why I don't really like it but wealth
