00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
get a toss to be honest so and most of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
get a toss to be honest so and most of
buttons<00:01:03.180> well<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.719> fact<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> buttons<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
buttons well in fact all the buttons and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.060 
buttons well in fact all the buttons and
joysticks<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.040> hooked<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
joysticks are all hooked up and the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830 
joysticks are all hooked up and the
reason<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> wires<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
reason there is a lot of wires is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
reason there is a lot of wires is
because<00:01:11.479> allah<00:01:12.590> there's<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.680> batch<00:01:14.280> wires

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
because allah there's one batch wires

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
because allah there's one batch wires
going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.860> jama<00:01:16.860> harness<00:01:18.020> there's<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> few

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
going to the jama harness there's a few

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
going to the jama harness there's a few
extra<00:01:19.350> ones<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> jpac<00:01:20.790> directly

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
extra ones going to the jpac directly

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.910 
extra ones going to the jpac directly
and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:21.689> there's<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> other<00:01:22.619> wires

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and then there's all the other wires

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.390 
and then there's all the other wires
that<00:01:23.220> control<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.750> LED<00:01:24.750> buttons<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.070> we

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that control the LED buttons of which we

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.800 
that control the LED buttons of which we
have<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.829> goes<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.880> this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
have one and and that goes so the this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.410 
have one and and that goes so the this
thing<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> pack<00:01:31.920> drive<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.850> controls<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
thing the pack drive that controls the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440 
thing the pack drive that controls the
leds<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.520> everything<00:01:35.520> else<00:01:35.670> goes<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.360> in

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
leds and everything else goes well in

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
leds and everything else goes well in
the<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:38.420> into<00:01:39.420> another<00:01:40.079> mess<00:01:40.290> em<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.700> that's

help<00:01:47.280> anyway<00:01:48.270> they<00:01:48.810> go<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.060> G<00:01:51.060> pad

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
help anyway they go so that is the G pad

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.069 
help anyway they go so that is the G pad
which<00:01:52.110> takes<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> 42<00:01:53.189> pin<00:01:53.540> jammer<00:01:54.540> connector

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
which takes the 42 pin jammer connector
