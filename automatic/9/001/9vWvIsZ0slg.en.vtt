00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.180 

now<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.780> show<00:02:25.989> opening<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:26.830> honey

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
now here we show opening a can of honey

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.500 
now here we show opening a can of honey
and<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.479 
and the
is<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.659> honey<00:02:29.840> don't<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.290> any<00:02:30.500> velcro

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
is a honey don't have any velcro

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.160 
is a honey don't have any velcro
attachment<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.569> hard<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.840> hold<00:02:33.019> them

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
attachment so it's hard to hold them

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.410 
attachment so it's hard to hold them
down<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> table<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:34.129> again<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.390> use

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
down to the table and again you can use

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.740 
down to the table and again you can use
your<00:02:36.230> your<00:02:37.010> surface<00:02:37.579> chemistry<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.629> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
your your surface chemistry to the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.449 
your your surface chemistry to the
rescue<00:02:38.959> here<00:02:39.470> where<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.040> put<00:02:40.189> a<00:02:40.250> little

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
rescue here where you can put a little

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.670 
rescue here where you can put a little
drop<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:41.120> water<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> bottom<00:02:42.079> of<00:02:42.349> your<00:02:42.409> can

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
drop of water on the bottom of your can

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.440 
drop of water on the bottom of your can
of<00:02:42.709> honey<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.310> then<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.819> stick<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.329> the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
of honey and then you stick it to the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.170 
of honey and then you stick it to the
table<00:02:44.689> and<00:02:44.989> there<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.680> voila<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:46.879> you<00:02:46.940> can

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
table and there it is voila now you can

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.170 
table and there it is voila now you can
go<00:02:47.360> ahead<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:48.440> can<00:02:48.879> you<00:02:49.879> don't<00:02:50.030> need<00:02:50.120> to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
go ahead and you can you don't need to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.699 
go ahead and you can you don't need to
worry<00:02:50.299> about<00:02:50.420> your<00:02:50.690> can<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:50.930> honey<00:02:51.230> floating

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
worry about your can of honey floating

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.530 
worry about your can of honey floating
off<00:02:51.829> because<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.670> stuck<00:02:53.060> there<00:02:53.269> on<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
off because it's just stuck there on the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.990 
off because it's just stuck there on the
table<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.230> again<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.069> may<00:02:55.310> be<00:02:55.370> one<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.760> them

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
table and again this may be one of them

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.539 
table and again this may be one of them
the<00:02:56.359> more<00:02:56.629> useful<00:02:57.379> applications<00:02:58.129> of<00:02:58.310> all<00:02:58.430> of

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
the more useful applications of all of

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.190 
the more useful applications of all of
this<00:02:58.640> surface<00:02:58.879> chemistry<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.689> I<00:02:59.750> learned<00:03:00.019> in

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
this surface chemistry that I learned in

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.309 
this surface chemistry that I learned in
college<00:03:00.409> Nick<00:03:01.400> usin<00:03:01.730> alpha<00:03:02.090> thats<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.049> our

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850
