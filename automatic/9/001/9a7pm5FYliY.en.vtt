actually this is just one cup of brown

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.300 
actually this is just one cup of brown
rice<00:04:01.019> flour<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:04.260> could<00:04:04.440> use<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.620> brown<00:04:05.100> rice

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
rice flour you could use all brown rice

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.289 
rice flour you could use all brown rice
flour<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.880> then<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.090> would<00:04:06.209> be<00:04:06.680> gluten<00:04:07.680> free

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
flour and then it would be gluten free

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.670 
flour and then it would be gluten free
although<00:04:09.299> i<00:04:09.690> know<00:04:09.959> there<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.380> controversy

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
although i know there is controversy

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.039 
although i know there is controversy
about<00:04:11.340> oats<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.910> gluten<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:12.690> can<00:04:12.900> get

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
about oats and gluten if you can get

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.660 
about oats and gluten if you can get
uncontaminated<00:04:13.620> oats<00:04:14.130> than<00:04:14.400> they<00:04:14.519> would

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
uncontaminated oats than they would

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.740 
uncontaminated oats than they would
technically<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.290> gluten<00:04:16.290> free<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.479> that's<00:04:18.479> my

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
technically be gluten free so that's my

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.599 
technically be gluten free so that's my
take<00:04:18.989> on<00:04:19.169> that

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
take on that

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.749 
take on that
next<00:04:20.879> step<00:04:21.060> we've<00:04:21.329> got<00:04:21.659> our<00:04:21.900> spices<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.430> we've

pineapple in pineapple juice so you're

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.209 
pineapple in pineapple juice so you're
actually<00:04:48.900> only<00:04:49.229> going<00:04:49.469> to<00:04:49.530> need<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.680> use<00:04:49.830> half

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
actually only going to need to use half

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.779 
actually only going to need to use half
of<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.060> I'm<00:04:51.330> just<00:04:51.509> going<00:04:51.689> to<00:04:51.750> guesstimate

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
of it so I'm just going to guesstimate

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.749 
of it so I'm just going to guesstimate
use<00:04:53.789> about<00:04:54.029> half<00:04:54.139> here<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:58.279> think<00:04:59.279> that's<00:04:59.550> about

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
use about half here I think that's about
