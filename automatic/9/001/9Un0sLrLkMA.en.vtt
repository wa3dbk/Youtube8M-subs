00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
shade here it will also take Sun I would

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
shade here it will also take Sun I would
let<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.750> dry<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.710> full<00:01:37.979> Sun<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
let it dry out if it's in full Sun but I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330 
let it dry out if it's in full Sun but I
just<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:40.140> useful<00:01:40.500> plant<00:01:41.040> for

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
just think it's a very useful plant for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.410 
just think it's a very useful plant for
its<00:01:41.579> flower<00:01:41.939> at<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.840> year

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
its flower at this time of the year

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.870 
its flower at this time of the year
and<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.810> these<00:01:43.960> wonderfully<00:01:44.560> attractive

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and so these wonderfully attractive

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.190 
and so these wonderfully attractive
architectural<00:01:45.880> leaves<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.870> makes<00:01:47.020> a

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
architectural leaves it makes a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.870 
architectural leaves it makes a
wonderful<00:01:47.410> contrast<00:01:48.160> with<00:01:48.520> some<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.820> the
