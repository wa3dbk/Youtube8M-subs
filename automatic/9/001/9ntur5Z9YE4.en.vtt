with<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> format<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.590> start<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.340> -

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
with the format we start with this -

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.100

from<00:00:27.859> date<00:00:28.859> subject<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.529> much<00:00:31.710> same<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
from date subject this is much same as a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.030 
from date subject this is much same as a
an<00:00:34.110> email<00:00:35.600> it's<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.870> compulsory

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
but it's a good idea to give to show the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
but it's a good idea to give to show the
examiner<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> report

more<00:02:32.439> people<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> area<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.930> an<00:02:34.989> idea

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
more people in the area so it's an idea

more people in the area so it's an idea
and<00:02:35.620> then<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.489> reason<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:40.150> reference

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
and then a reason then with reference
