00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
weeks I've been creating some parts on

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.830 
weeks I've been creating some parts on
my<00:00:51.310> solidoodle<00:00:51.880> 3d<00:00:52.510> printer<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.450> how<00:00:55.780> I

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
my solidoodle 3d printer this is how I

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.580 
my solidoodle 3d printer this is how I
do<00:00:56.079> it

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
do it

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.400 
do it
this<00:00:56.710> may<00:00:56.890> not<00:00:57.070> be<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.400> best<00:00:57.579> way<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.290> print<00:00:59.290> all

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
this may not be the best way I print all

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.010 
this may not be the best way I print all
the<00:00:59.560> parts<00:00:59.860> out<00:00:59.980> in<00:01:00.190> advance<00:01:00.540> label<00:01:01.540> them<00:01:01.750> for

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
the parts out in advance label them for

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.859 
the parts out in advance label them for
the<00:01:02.110> area<00:01:02.470> that<00:01:02.739> they<00:01:02.920> belong<00:01:03.310> in<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.910> then

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
the area that they belong in and then

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.310 
the area that they belong in and then
start<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.320> assembly<00:01:05.740> process<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.170> can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
start the assembly process as you can

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.440 
start the assembly process as you can

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.410 
didn't see it all posted here I went
ahead<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:26.979> got<00:01:27.190> some<00:01:27.220> parts<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:27.940> my<00:01:28.060> 3d

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
ahead and got some parts for my 3d

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.650 
ahead and got some parts for my 3d
printed<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.960> was<00:01:29.800> always<00:01:29.920> having<00:01:30.190> some<00:01:30.660> banding

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
printed I was always having some banding

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.169 
printed I was always having some banding
problems<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.550> ended<00:01:33.819> up<00:01:33.940> with<00:01:34.149> a

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
problems and then I ended up with a

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.430 
problems and then I ended up with a
clogged<00:01:35.009> extruder<00:01:36.009> that<00:01:36.569> was<00:01:37.569> basically

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
clogged extruder that was basically

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.669 
clogged extruder that was basically
clogged<00:01:38.860> beyond<00:01:39.250> repair<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:40.119> can<00:01:40.990> still<00:01:41.229> fix<00:01:41.440> it

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
clogged beyond repair I can still fix it

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.199 
clogged beyond repair I can still fix it
but<00:01:41.950> it's<00:01:42.160> going<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.459> take<00:01:42.640> more<00:01:42.789> time<00:01:42.970> than

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
but it's going to take more time than

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.919 
but it's going to take more time than
it's<00:01:43.360> worth<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:44.979> went<00:01:45.759> ahead<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.000> got<00:01:46.209> the

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
it's worth so I went ahead and got the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's worth so I went ahead and got the
new<00:01:47.080> components<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:49.140> kept<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.289> printing<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.720> I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750

is just I'm beyond thrilled so these are
more<00:02:02.140> parts<00:02:02.619> for<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.429> N<00:02:03.520> move<00:02:03.729> head<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:05.259> is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
more parts for the N move head there is

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.809 
more parts for the N move head there is
almost<00:02:05.709> zero<00:02:07.740> indication<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.459> layers

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
almost zero indication of the layers

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.410 
almost zero indication of the layers
this<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:11.890> go<00:02:12.040> three<00:02:12.340> times<00:02:12.610> more

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
this this is I can go three times more

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.770 
this this is I can go three times more
resolution<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.270> don't<00:02:16.330> need<00:02:16.720> to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
resolution on this but I don't need to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.370 
resolution on this but I don't need to
I'm<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:18.490> absolutely<00:02:18.870> thrilled<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
I'm just absolutely thrilled with the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.490 
I'm just absolutely thrilled with the
results<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.400> rivals<00:02:22.240> an<00:02:22.420> injection<00:02:22.990> molded

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
results this rivals an injection molded

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.420 
results this rivals an injection molded
piece<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.860> increase<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.069> resolution

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
piece with this increase in resolution

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.970 
piece with this increase in resolution
I'm<00:02:27.970> now<00:02:28.180> able<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.810> make<00:02:28.989> things<00:02:29.349> like<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
I'm now able to make things like the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.170 
I'm now able to make things like the
lead<00:02:30.159> screw

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
lead screw

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
jaw very smooth I printed this at point

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.259 
jaw very smooth I printed this at point
two<00:02:38.530> millimeter<00:02:39.129> layer<00:02:39.430> height<00:02:39.760> without<00:02:40.090> a

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
two millimeter layer height without a

two millimeter layer height without a
macro<00:02:40.719> lens<00:02:40.930> there's<00:02:41.319> no<00:02:41.469> way<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.829> even

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
macro lens there's no way I can even

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.280 
macro lens there's no way I can even
show<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.849> layering<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.689> it's<00:02:43.959> crazy

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
show you the layering on this it's crazy

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.750 
show you the layering on this it's crazy
smooth<00:02:44.980> really<00:02:45.939> excited<00:02:46.689> about<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:47.109> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
smooth really excited about that and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.789 
smooth really excited about that and
also<00:02:48.760> allows<00:02:49.209> me<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.599> do<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> much<00:02:50.260> better<00:02:50.290> job

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
also allows me to do a much better job

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.809 
also allows me to do a much better job
on<00:02:51.310> items<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:51.849> this<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:53.409> is<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.310> gear<00:02:54.549> that

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
on items like this this is the gear that

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.539 
on items like this this is the gear that
drives<00:02:55.319> one<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.469> the<00:02:56.560> neck<00:02:56.739> mechanisms<00:02:57.430> I

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
drives one of the neck mechanisms I

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.420 
drives one of the neck mechanisms I
think<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.420> head<00:02:58.780> pivot<00:02:59.349> left<00:03:00.189> to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
think this is the head pivot left to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.250 
think this is the head pivot left to
right<00:03:00.639> I<00:03:00.879> could<00:03:01.299> be<00:03:01.329> wrong<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.780> because<00:03:02.109> I

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
right I could be wrong on that because I

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.369 
right I could be wrong on that because I
haven't<00:03:02.409> started<00:03:02.680> building<00:03:02.799> it<00:03:03.659> I'm<00:03:04.659> this

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
haven't started building it I'm this

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.509 
haven't started building it I'm this
this<00:03:07.230> vertical<00:03:08.230> lines<00:03:08.530> here<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.099> actually

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
this vertical lines here is actually

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.140 
this vertical lines here is actually
part<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.000> model<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:12.040> gears<00:03:12.370> are<00:03:12.790> just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
part of the model but the gears are just

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.539 
part of the model but the gears are just
perfect<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.230> couldn't<00:03:14.859> ask<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.129> any<00:03:15.370> better

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
perfect I couldn't ask for any better

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.420 
perfect I couldn't ask for any better
super<00:03:16.299> excited<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.469> I<00:03:17.500> went<00:03:17.829> from<00:03:18.069> something

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
super excited so I went from something

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.709 
super excited so I went from something
that<00:03:18.639> had<00:03:19.120> layering<00:03:19.689> like<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.599> one

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:22.719 
that had layering like that to the one

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.399 
that had layering like that to the one
on<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.989> right<00:03:23.459> guys<00:03:24.459> that's<00:03:24.819> I'm<00:03:25.389> just<00:03:25.719> super

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
on the right guys that's I'm just super

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.580 
on the right guys that's I'm just super
tickled<00:03:27.069> with<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.310> results<00:03:27.969> I<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.359> now

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
tickled with the results I can now

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.069 
tickled with the results I can now
really<00:03:29.590> step<00:03:29.950> up<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.280> quality<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
really step up the quality and the

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.140 
really step up the quality and the
strength<00:03:32.079> of<00:03:32.379> components<00:03:33.129> these<00:03:33.760> ones<00:03:34.030> are

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
strength of components these ones are

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.479 
strength of components these ones are
actually<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.599> little<00:03:34.959> weak<00:03:35.229> because<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:36.310> can

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
actually a little weak because you can

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.849 
actually a little weak because you can
see<00:03:36.699> there's<00:03:36.940> actually<00:03:37.269> gaps<00:03:37.569> there's<00:03:38.440> infill

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
see there's actually gaps there's infill

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.559 
see there's actually gaps there's infill
between<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.609> it's<00:03:39.760> still<00:03:39.970> plenty<00:03:40.329> strong

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
between so it's still plenty strong

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.099 
between so it's still plenty strong
plenty<00:03:41.139> good<00:03:41.260> enough<00:03:41.319> for<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.769> robot<00:03:42.159> but<00:03:43.109> it

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
plenty good enough for a robot but it

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.909 
plenty good enough for a robot but it
was<00:03:44.290> never<00:03:44.500> right<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.819> have<00:03:46.120> finally<00:03:46.919> got

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
was never right and I have finally got

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.280 
was never right and I have finally got
to<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.250> point<00:03:48.430> where<00:03:48.639> I'm<00:03:48.729> happy<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:50.109> what

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290

entire open-source in move robot project
super<00:04:08.229> excited<00:04:08.859> about<00:04:08.949> it<00:04:09.129> I<00:04:09.430> don't<00:04:09.970> think<00:04:10.150> I

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
super excited about it I don't think I

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.789 
super excited about it I don't think I
will<00:04:11.079> be<00:04:11.259> building<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.709> entire<00:04:12.099> robot<00:04:13.799> it's

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
will be building the entire robot it's

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.649 
will be building the entire robot it's
awfully<00:04:15.220> tempting<00:04:15.489> though<00:04:15.909> once<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.389> start

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
awfully tempting though once you start

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.360 
awfully tempting though once you start
to<00:04:16.780> see<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.139> results<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.829> see<00:04:17.979> what<00:04:18.099> we<00:04:18.220> can

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
to see the results and see what we can

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.580 
to see the results and see what we can
do<00:04:18.519> with<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.729> but<00:04:19.060> will<00:04:19.269> will<00:04:19.930> sort<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.289> play<00:04:20.470> it
