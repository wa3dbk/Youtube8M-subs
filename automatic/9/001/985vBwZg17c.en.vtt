00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
for me the most important thing is from

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
thinking from the beginning nah but this

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.759 
thinking from the beginning nah but this
is<00:00:26.919> important<00:00:27.400> this<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.550> know<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:27.820> need<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.769> to

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
is important this is know I need to to

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.040 
is important this is know I need to to
absorb<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.689> just<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:33.030> examine<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.480> material

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
absorb it's just I examine the material

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.190 
absorb it's just I examine the material
and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.820> real<00:00:37.030> process<00:00:37.510> starts<00:00:37.840> with

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
and then the real process starts with

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.650 
and then the real process starts with
your<00:00:38.440> case<00:00:38.620> file

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660

watch the score a lot even if I know the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.980 
watch the score a lot even if I know the
piece<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.440> that's<00:01:12.770> my<00:01:13.100> strong<00:01:13.940> part<00:01:14.750> of<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
piece and that's my strong part of the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.249 
piece and that's my strong part of the
pattern<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:18.160> absorb<00:01:19.160> but<00:01:20.000> then<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.659> need<00:01:21.140> to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
pattern I absorb but then I need to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.899 
pattern I absorb but then I need to
start<00:01:21.710> shaping<00:01:21.920> okay<00:01:23.530> stop

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
not crescendo and then screw it all

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.190 
not crescendo and then screw it all

doctor<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.840> guess<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> tiny<00:01:42.170> bit<00:01:42.550> it's<00:01:43.550> very

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
doctor I guess a tiny bit it's very

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.389 
doctor I guess a tiny bit it's very
important<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.600> not<00:01:45.020> compromising<00:01:45.770> ideas<00:01:46.220> at

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
important to not compromising ideas at

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.930 
important to not compromising ideas at
all<00:01:46.610> because<00:01:46.789> I'm<00:01:47.060> I'm<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:48.429> am<00:01:49.429> NOT<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:49.850> the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
all because I'm I'm I am NOT in the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.600 
all because I'm I'm I am NOT in the
musicians<00:01:50.840> know<00:01:51.050> very<00:01:51.289> well<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.920> pursue

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
musicians know very well that I pursue

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.400 
musicians know very well that I pursue
ideas<00:01:52.759> until<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.660> very<00:01:53.929> very<00:01:54.170> last

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
ideas until the very very last

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.740 
ideas until the very very last
consequence<00:01:55.340> but<00:01:55.940> then<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.240> course<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.600> have

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
consequence but then of course you have

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.830 
consequence but then of course you have
to<00:01:56.899> count<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.830> musicians<00:01:58.840> creativity

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
to count on the musicians creativity

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.910 
to count on the musicians creativity
with<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.740> only<00:02:01.190> genuine<00:02:01.789> way<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.380> bringing<00:02:03.380> an

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
with the only genuine way of bringing an

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.880 
with the only genuine way of bringing an
idea<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.060> orchestra<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.799> making<00:02:06.799> the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
idea to the orchestra is making the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.030 
idea to the orchestra is making the
musicians<00:02:07.520> which<00:02:08.509> they<00:02:09.200> are<00:02:09.350> artists<00:02:09.829> and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
musicians which they are artists and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
musicians which they are artists and
they're<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.549> yes<00:02:12.100> numbers<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.660> belief<00:02:14.660> in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
they're not yes numbers of belief in

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.490 
they're not yes numbers of belief in
that<00:02:15.049> when<00:02:15.890> sorrow<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.090> when<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.269> section<00:02:17.750> they

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
that when sorrow is when a section they

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.220 
that when sorrow is when a section they
believe<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.790> yes<00:02:20.570> sure<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.049> asked

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
believe in that yes sure that you asked

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.560 
believe in that yes sure that you asked
for<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.980> result<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.340> different<00:02:22.549> it's<00:02:23.420> not

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
for the result is different it's not

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.449 
for the result is different it's not
that<00:02:23.720> no<00:02:24.049> play<00:02:24.500> longer<00:02:24.769> or<00:02:25.070> shorter

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that no play longer or shorter

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.710 
that no play longer or shorter
no<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:26.030> give<00:02:26.840> more<00:02:27.140> impulse<00:02:27.530> add<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.700> bit<00:02:29.690> more

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
no it's give more impulse add a bit more

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.960 
no it's give more impulse add a bit more
perspective<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.709> phrase<00:02:31.010> or<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
perspective to that phrase or and the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.120 
perspective to that phrase or and the
result<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.329> different<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.230> try<00:02:33.560> always

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
result is different so I try always

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.970 
result is different so I try always
going<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.910> direction<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.900> democracy<00:02:36.799> in

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
going in that direction the democracy in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.490 
going in that direction the democracy in
orchestras<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.820> relative<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:39.019> finally

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
orchestras is relative because finally

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.770 
orchestras is relative because finally
there<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.680> someone<00:02:40.070> who<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.060> make<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
there is someone who have to make the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.860 
there is someone who have to make the
decision<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.890> do<00:02:43.370> believe<00:02:44.000> strongly<00:02:44.630> that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
decision but I do believe strongly that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.949 
decision but I do believe strongly that
you<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.530> embrace<00:02:46.250> everyone<00:02:46.850> into<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
you have to embrace everyone into the

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.670 
you have to embrace everyone into the
same<00:02:48.170> into<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> same

same into the same

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:04.830 
same into the same
impulse<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.640> same<00:02:51.110> objective
