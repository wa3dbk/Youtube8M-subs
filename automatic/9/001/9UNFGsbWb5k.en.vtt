00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
out of the way first so we're using

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.880 
out of the way first so we're using
edible<00:00:45.870> icing<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> just

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
edible icing to do that and you just

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
edible icing to do that and you just
need<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> roll<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.850> icing<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.899> ball<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
need to roll the icing into a ball and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.160 
need to roll the icing into a ball and
then<00:00:52.590> flatten<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.809> makes<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
then flatten it out and that makes the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.000 
then flatten it out and that makes the
main<00:00:55.379> part<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.430> eye<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.440> then<00:00:58.440> afterwards

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
main part of the eye and then afterwards

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.900

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.270 
now I'm just going to use this icing pen
to<00:05:42.360> help<00:05:42.509> stick<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.169> eyes<00:05:45.409> so<00:05:46.409> put<00:05:47.009> a<00:05:47.039> nice

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
to help stick on the eyes so put a nice

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.980 
to help stick on the eyes so put a nice
bit<00:05:47.490> of<00:05:47.520> icing<00:05:47.759> and<00:05:48.270> then<00:05:48.449> we<00:05:48.569> can<00:05:48.689> stick<00:05:48.900> the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
bit of icing and then we can stick the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.140 
bit of icing and then we can stick the
eyes<00:05:49.139> on<00:05:49.409> top

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
eyes on top

00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:01.270 
eyes on top
this<00:05:51.780> is<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.050> bit<00:05:52.290> of<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.440> fib<00:05:52.680> leader

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:10.159 

and<00:06:02.280> then<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.240> just<00:06:03.449> place<00:06:03.719> the<00:06:03.930> eyes<00:06:04.080> on

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.640 

oh<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:11.610> getting<00:06:11.879> icing<00:06:12.270> on<00:06:12.360> my<00:06:12.389> fingers

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.380 

so<00:06:17.010> it's<00:06:17.160> probably<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.520> better<00:06:17.700> idea<00:06:18.120> if<00:06:18.210> you

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
so it's probably a better idea if you

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.100 
so it's probably a better idea if you
wait<00:06:18.600> until<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:19.170> icing<00:06:19.350> is<00:06:19.680> actually<00:06:20.190> set<00:06:20.490> and

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
wait until the icing is actually set and

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.610 
wait until the icing is actually set and
there<00:06:22.110> you<00:06:22.260> go<00:06:23.720> so<00:06:24.720> now<00:06:24.870> you<00:06:24.930> can<00:06:25.140> see<00:06:25.350> the<00:06:25.440> eyes

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
there you go so now you can see the eyes

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.510 
there you go so now you can see the eyes
