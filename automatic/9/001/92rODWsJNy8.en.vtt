500 pages but I think what we should do

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.219 
500 pages but I think what we should do
is<00:01:48.429> have<00:01:48.459> dad<00:01:48.849> tell<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.179> a<00:01:49.330> few<00:01:49.539> sentences<00:01:49.929> and

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
is have dad tell you a few sentences and

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.990 
is have dad tell you a few sentences and
you<00:01:50.319> can<00:01:50.470> use<00:01:50.649> that<00:01:50.830> when<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.369> go<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.849> book

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
you can use that when you go to the book

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.919 
you can use that when you go to the book
stores<00:01:52.269> and<00:01:52.509> things<00:01:52.660> like<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.479> did<00:01:55.720> want
