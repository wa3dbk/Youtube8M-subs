00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
provide genetic information so it sounds

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.540 
provide genetic information so it sounds
like<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> geneticist<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.159> very

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
like a geneticist can be a very

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669 
like a geneticist can be a very
important<00:02:08.970> part<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.080> health<00:02:10.259> care<00:02:10.440> team

important part of the health care team

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.180 
important part of the health care team
well<00:02:11.610> obviously<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.440> in

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
well obviously we think so and in

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.830 
well obviously we think so and in
addition<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.879> complement<00:02:15.629> other

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
addition they complement other

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.160 
addition they complement other
physicians<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.769> they<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:18.170> necessarily

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
physicians so they do not necessarily

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.050 
physicians so they do not necessarily

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.460 
obstetrician and so it's exciting to me
to<00:04:33.920> learn<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.430> lot<00:04:34.670> about<00:04:34.820> development<00:04:35.540> we're

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
to learn a lot about development we're

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.920 
to learn a lot about development we're
in<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.710> position<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.460> predict<00:04:37.970> how<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
in a position to predict how the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.900 
in a position to predict how the
development<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.680> occurring<00:04:40.040> we're

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
development is occurring we're

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.680 
development is occurring we're
increasingly<00:04:41.540> in<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.900> position<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:42.800> treat

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
increasingly in a position to treat

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.810 
increasingly in a position to treat
conditions<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:45.380> may<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.860> gone<00:04:46.040> astray<00:04:46.250> as

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
conditions that may have gone astray as

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.320 
conditions that may have gone astray as
a<00:04:47.270> result<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.350> genetic<00:04:48.770> problem<00:04:49.330> and

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
a result of a genetic problem and

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.540 
a result of a genetic problem and
increasingly<00:04:50.960> overall<00:04:51.740> provide<00:04:52.280> much<00:04:52.520> better

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
increasingly overall provide much better

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.080 
increasingly overall provide much better
health<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.930> general<00:04:54.260> public<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:55.250> pregnant

born to me this is very exciting time as
we<00:05:02.000> see<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.450> fruits<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:02.960> human<00:05:03.290> genome

we see the fruits of the human genome

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.030 
we see the fruits of the human genome
initiative<00:05:04.300> coming<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.630> bear<00:05:06.020> we<00:05:06.950> are

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
initiative coming to bear we are

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.010 
initiative coming to bear we are
learning<00:05:07.280> more<00:05:07.670> and<00:05:08.030> more<00:05:08.300> about<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.810> some

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
there's a lot of excitement to look

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.860 
there's a lot of excitement to look
