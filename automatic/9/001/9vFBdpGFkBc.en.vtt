00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:59.660 

Oh

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:32.790 

ah

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.170 

that's<00:01:33.800> probably<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.340> hardest<00:01:34.760> race<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:35.090> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
that's probably the hardest race of the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.330 
that's probably the hardest race of the
road<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.480> ride<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.930> Beijing<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:36.980> was<00:01:37.100> flat<00:01:37.310> out

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
road to ride and Beijing I was flat out

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.920 
road to ride and Beijing I was flat out
for<00:01:37.640> 20<00:01:37.730> minutes<00:01:38.150> after<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.510> race<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:38.870> I

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
for 20 minutes after the race and I

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.790 
for 20 minutes after the race and I
thought<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.260> was<00:01:39.380> probably<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> hardest

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
thought that was probably the hardest

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.700 
thought that was probably the hardest
race<00:01:40.220> had<00:01:40.400> ever<00:01:40.520> done<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:40.940> got<00:01:41.570> into<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> center

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
race had ever done I got into the center

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.260 
race had ever done I got into the center
after<00:01:42.980> finishing<00:01:43.280> my<00:01:43.400> race<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.910> I<00:01:44.030> was

absolutely<00:01:44.510> shocked<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:45.500> don't<00:01:45.680> know<00:01:45.740> what

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
absolutely shocked I don't know what

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
London so yeah it's a slightly inferior

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.280 
London so yeah it's a slightly inferior
kit<00:02:07.100> still<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.520> as<00:02:07.670> quick<00:02:07.880> but<00:02:08.149> yeah<00:02:08.899> it's

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
kit still just as quick but yeah it's

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.170 
kit still just as quick but yeah it's
nice<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.800> take<00:02:10.010> out<00:02:10.160> those<00:02:10.310> times<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.910> go

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
nice just to take out those times and go

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.180 
nice just to take out those times and go
faster<00:02:11.600> than<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.840> did<00:02:11.990> on<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.040> mean

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
faster than we did on that the mean

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.970 
faster than we did on that the mean
