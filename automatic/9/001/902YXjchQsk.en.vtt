she was sit in her rocking chair until
the<00:00:59.550> idea<00:01:00.060> came<00:01:00.300> into<00:01:00.480> her<00:01:00.690> head<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.900> she

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the idea came into her head and she

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.950 
the idea came into her head and she
called<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> inspiration<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.610> sort<00:01:02.820> of

appeared in her head at a very small

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.920 
appeared in her head at a very small
scale<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.460> postage<00:01:11.880> stamp<00:01:12.210> so

complicated<00:01:21.750> mathematics<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:23.340> scale<00:01:23.760> it<00:01:23.940> up

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
complicated mathematics to scale it up

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.350 
complicated mathematics to scale it up
to<00:01:24.180> meet<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.100> self<00:01:26.100> defined<00:01:26.550> limitations<00:01:27.240> of

weren't what I wanted I wanted really

weren't what I wanted I wanted really
abstract<00:04:29.100> without<00:04:30.100> any<00:04:30.400> cause<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.419> world

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
abstract without any cause in this world

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.460 
abstract without any cause in this world
you<00:04:32.980> know<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:36.430> every<00:04:36.850> day<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.260> painted<00:04:38.260> I

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
you know and so every day I painted I

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.430 
you know and so every day I painted I
got<00:04:38.710> closer<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.340> closer<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:40.060> abstract<00:04:40.990> rain

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
got closer and closer to abstract rain

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:53.970 
got closer and closer to abstract rain
but<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.490> took<00:04:42.640> me<00:04:42.850> 20<00:04:43.270> years<00:04:52.440> then<00:04:53.440> we<00:04:53.560> tend<00:04:53.830> to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
but it took me 20 years then we tend to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.370 
but it took me 20 years then we tend to
associate<00:04:54.640> Agnes<00:04:55.030> Martin<00:04:55.240> with<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.690> grid<00:04:55.930> but

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
associate Agnes Martin with the grid but

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.440 
associate Agnes Martin with the grid but
she<00:04:56.500> wasn't<00:04:56.770> born<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.280> fully<00:04:57.550> fledged<00:04:57.880> abstract

she wasn't born a fully fledged abstract
painter<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.050> she<00:04:59.080> went<00:04:59.350> through<00:04:59.500> two<00:04:59.770> decades

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
painter and she went through two decades

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.060 
painter and she went through two decades
of<00:05:00.520> really<00:05:01.240> incredibly<00:05:01.630> intense

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
of really incredibly intense

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.830 
of really incredibly intense
experimentation<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.669> achieve<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.300> that

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
experimentation to achieve that that

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:30.570 
experimentation to achieve that that
moment<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.320> perfection

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.450 

she<00:05:31.240> was<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.390> painter<00:05:31.690> with<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.110> long<00:05:32.410> life<00:05:32.740> who

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
she was a painter with a long life who

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.000 
she was a painter with a long life who
painted<00:05:33.880> every<00:05:34.270> single<00:05:34.660> day<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:35.440> get<00:05:35.830> it

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
painted every single day and get it

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.850 
painted every single day and get it
alone<00:05:36.370> all<00:05:36.700> of<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.000> work<00:05:37.180> she<00:05:37.420> didn't<00:05:37.780> mind<00:05:37.960> so

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
alone all of the work she didn't mind so

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.390 
alone all of the work she didn't mind so
if<00:05:39.250> there<00:05:39.490> was<00:05:39.580> a<00:05:39.610> composition<00:05:40.420> that<00:05:40.630> she

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
if there was a composition that she

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.820 
if there was a composition that she
achieved<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:43.540> then<00:05:43.840> if<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.200> wasn't<00:05:44.680> quite

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
achieved and then if it wasn't quite

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.010 
achieved and then if it wasn't quite
right<00:05:45.480> she<00:05:46.480> would<00:05:46.660> destroy<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.260> picture<00:05:47.710> with

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
right she would destroy the picture with

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.020 
right she would destroy the picture with
mat<00:05:50.020> knife<00:05:50.260> she'd<00:05:50.680> cut<00:05:50.920> up<00:05:51.070> her<00:05:51.190> paintings<00:05:51.700> and

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
mat knife she'd cut up her paintings and

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.170 
mat knife she'd cut up her paintings and
she<00:05:52.300> paint<00:05:52.750> that<00:05:53.260> painting<00:05:53.680> again<00:05:53.980> and<00:05:54.340> she

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
she paint that painting again and she

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.390 
she paint that painting again and she
could<00:05:55.360> paint<00:05:55.570> that<00:05:55.780> painting<00:05:56.260> ten<00:05:56.590> times<00:05:57.010> and

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
could paint that painting ten times and

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.050 
could paint that painting ten times and
destroy<00:05:58.240> nine<00:05:58.600> of<00:05:58.870> them<00:05:59.050> so<00:06:00.010> Martin<00:06:00.790> was<00:06:00.940> the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
destroy nine of them so Martin was the

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.590 
destroy nine of them so Martin was the
greatest<00:06:01.480> editor<00:06:02.020> of<00:06:02.490> work<00:06:03.490> I<00:06:03.790> think<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:04.330> any

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
greatest editor of work I think of any

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.660 
greatest editor of work I think of any
artist<00:06:05.020> probably<00:06:05.290> who<00:06:05.710> ever<00:06:05.920> lived

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
artist probably who ever lived

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.480 
artist probably who ever lived
I<00:06:08.070> think<00:06:09.070> about<00:06:09.340> nothing<00:06:09.880> but<00:06:10.030> painting<00:06:11.490> when

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
I think about nothing but painting when

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.450 
I think about nothing but painting when
the<00:06:12.670> older<00:06:13.120> again<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:15.490> more<00:06:15.670> I<00:06:15.700> like<00:06:16.150> to<00:06:16.450> paint

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
the older again the more I like to paint

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.810 
the older again the more I like to paint
yeah

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
yeah

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:26.160 
yeah
it<00:06:19.600> grows<00:06:19.960> on<00:06:20.290> you<00:06:21.870> just<00:06:22.870> imagine<00:06:23.530> I<00:06:25.110> may<00:06:26.110> be

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
it grows on you just imagine I may be

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:39.350 
it grows on you just imagine I may be
eight<00:06:26.530> so<00:06:27.120> with<00:06:28.120> the<00:06:28.270> road<00:06:28.450> for<00:06:28.870> quite<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.140> while

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.960 

looking<00:06:40.360> at<00:06:40.570> these<00:06:40.750> grids<00:06:41.230> and<00:06:41.970> repetitive

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
looking at these grids and repetitive

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.560 
looking at these grids and repetitive
lines<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.810> passages<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:44.950> pale<00:06:45.190> color<00:06:45.570> think

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
lines and passages of pale color think

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.790 
lines and passages of pale color think
of<00:06:46.720> them<00:06:46.990> as<00:06:47.200> much<00:06:47.830> as<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.160> mantra<00:06:48.790> as<00:06:49.320> a<00:06:50.320> visual

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
of them as much as a mantra as a visual

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.840 
of them as much as a mantra as a visual
experience<00:06:50.950> and<00:06:52.140> the<00:06:53.140> repetition<00:06:53.380> is<00:06:54.190> like

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
experience and the repetition is like

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.810 
experience and the repetition is like
the<00:06:55.060> repetition<00:06:55.720> of<00:06:55.870> a<00:06:56.020> sound<00:06:56.350> and<00:06:56.710> Martin<00:06:57.610> has

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
the repetition of a sound and Martin has

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.720 
the repetition of a sound and Martin has
felt<00:06:58.210> that<00:06:59.200> the<00:07:00.160> painting<00:07:00.700> is<00:07:00.880> a<00:07:00.940> kind<00:07:01.270> of<00:07:01.420> map

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
felt that the painting is a kind of map

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.890 
felt that the painting is a kind of map
and<00:07:02.820> it's<00:07:03.030> a<00:07:03.150> map<00:07:03.390> to<00:07:03.750> your<00:07:04.490> inner<00:07:05.900> responses

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
and it's a map to your inner responses

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.190 
and it's a map to your inner responses
whether<00:07:07.380> it<00:07:07.590> be<00:07:07.770> joy<00:07:08.070> or<00:07:08.460> happiness<00:07:08.520> or<00:07:09.510> that

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
whether it be joy or happiness or that

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.360 
whether it be joy or happiness or that
it<00:07:10.350> makes<00:07:10.560> you<00:07:10.740> calm<00:07:11.330> that's<00:07:12.330> the<00:07:12.690> work<00:07:12.870> of<00:07:13.020> art

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
it makes you calm that's the work of art

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.030 
it makes you calm that's the work of art
that<00:07:14.370> her<00:07:14.550> painting<00:07:14.970> is<00:07:15.120> a<00:07:15.150> key<00:07:15.540> to<00:07:16.470> the<00:07:16.710> art

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
that her painting is a key to the art

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:31.850 
that her painting is a key to the art
within<00:07:17.640> you

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.919 

you
