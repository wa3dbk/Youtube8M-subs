 mistake must have 14 in a row by little 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 too much then there then we have nrj 900 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:45.600
 or without his game it's more you go 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:48.329

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.310
 who was coming to frankly she is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.269
 well enough so then we will type the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.269
 code c 2 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:28.520
 7 7% 7 7 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:33.300
 yeah that's it 5 5 5 0 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:43.670
 without the time assignment as may 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:56.510
 to have the 0.150 so there no it will work 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:04:05.570
 coming over again was waiting for them 7/2 7-5 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:05.570
 2-0 do not know why it did not work 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.270
 this is a flower follows the way 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.270

 not walk if we will have another car 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:42.570
 police on the head pretty good 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:52.830

 not in cheat codes but 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.900
 I hope seven good numbers 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.069
 the simple ones but it will not be in the 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.639
 cheat codes sit in the 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.909
