00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.910 
that tech you place only one blade free
so<00:03:50.160> he<00:03:50.190> has<00:03:50.370> no<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.390> give<00:03:51.600> removal<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.500> this

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
so he has no a we give removal for this

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.580 
so he has no a we give removal for this
board<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:57.900> will<00:03:58.050> be<00:03:58.200> much<00:03:58.380> more

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
board so this will be much more

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:10.820 
board so this will be much more
difficult<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:59.100> him<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.400> deal<00:03:59.790> with

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.380 

it<00:04:11.830> would<00:04:12.250> really<00:04:12.519> surprise<00:04:12.760> me<00:04:13.000> if<00:04:13.269> he

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
it would really surprise me if he

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.610 
it would really surprise me if he
actually<00:04:13.599> has<00:04:14.459> another<00:04:16.709> shooting<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:20.109> this

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
actually has another shooting at this

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:37.700 
actually has another shooting at this
guy's

the lightning storm here just gives me a

played<00:05:18.970> both<00:05:19.270> spirit<00:05:19.990> works<00:05:20.260> already<00:05:21.900> he<00:05:25.110> very

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
played both spirit works already he very

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.550 
played both spirit works already he very
strong

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.490 

he<00:05:35.560> probably<00:05:35.800> has<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:38.280> cold<00:05:39.280> light<00:05:39.580> called<00:05:40.500> cold

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
he probably has a cold light called cold

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.280 
he probably has a cold light called cold
blood<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:41.950> always<00:05:42.700> mix<00:05:42.940> up<00:05:43.150> cold<00:05:43.480> cold<00:05:44.050> light

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
blood I always mix up cold cold light

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.460 
blood I always mix up cold cold light
and<00:05:44.560> cold<00:05:44.950> blood<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:46.660> could<00:05:46.810> make<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.050> tongue

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
and cold blood you could make a tongue

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.150 
and cold blood you could make a tongue
twist<00:05:47.770> out<00:05:47.920> of<00:05:48.100> it<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:53.440> looks<00:05:53.650> pretty<00:05:53.890> grim

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
twist out of it so it looks pretty grim

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160 
twist out of it so it looks pretty grim
if<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.580> don't<00:05:54.640> overload<00:05:55.180> this<00:05:55.450> turn<00:05:55.690> I<00:05:55.900> could

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
if I don't overload this turn I could

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.800 
if I don't overload this turn I could
theoretically<00:05:56.650> play<00:05:57.190> he'll<00:05:57.850> also<00:05:58.090> reduced<00:05:58.660> at

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
theoretically play he'll also reduced at

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.630 
theoretically play he'll also reduced at
once<00:05:59.020> I've<00:05:59.200> already<00:05:59.350> the<00:05:59.710> alakija<00:06:00.160> next<00:06:00.460> turn

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
once I've already the alakija next turn

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.090 
once I've already the alakija next turn
but<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:01.750> chance<00:06:02.050> that<00:06:02.320> i<00:06:02.410> will<00:06:02.440> actually<00:06:02.920> lose

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
but the chance that i will actually lose

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.409 
but the chance that i will actually lose
the<00:06:03.280> game<00:06:03.460> here<00:06:03.880> is<00:06:04.060> pretty<00:06:04.480> high<00:06:06.270> like<00:06:07.270> it

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
the game here is pretty high like it

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.350 
the game here is pretty high like it
doesn't<00:06:07.690> make<00:06:07.900> sense<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.500> play<00:06:09.130> frogs<00:06:09.910> if<00:06:10.090> it's

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360

make and hope it from can be next
because<00:06:46.590> this<00:06:46.800> will<00:06:46.950> be<00:06:47.130> difficult<00:06:47.370> to<00:06:48.330> kill<00:06:48.540> I

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
because this will be difficult to kill I

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.720 
because this will be difficult to kill I

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
to load at a role at untoten just a clue

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.900 
to load at a role at untoten just a clue
serious

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.190 

he<00:07:14.540> won<00:07:14.690> three<00:07:14.960> out<00:07:14.990> of<00:07:15.200> five<00:07:15.680> games<00:07:16.100> I<00:07:17.110> think<00:07:18.110> a

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
he won three out of five games I think a

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.870 
he won three out of five games I think a
big<00:07:18.350> part<00:07:18.380> was<00:07:18.860> that<00:07:18.890> he<00:07:19.190> had<00:07:19.430> always<00:07:19.850> the<00:07:20.180> coin

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
big part was that he had always the coin

three<00:07:36.140> games<00:07:36.650> with<00:07:37.100> the<00:07:37.250> coin<00:07:37.490> which<00:07:37.790> is

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 
three games with the coin which is

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.670 
three games with the coin which is
really<00:07:38.180> strong<00:07:38.480> again<00:07:38.840> shaming<00:07:41.260> like<00:07:42.260> I<00:07:42.290> said

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 
really strong again shaming like I said

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.430 
really strong again shaming like I said
shame<00:07:43.010> it<00:07:43.160> depends<00:07:43.550> on<00:07:43.640> tempo<00:07:44.090> and<00:07:44.360> if<00:07:45.290> you

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
shame it depends on tempo and if you

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.170 
shame it depends on tempo and if you
don't<00:07:45.650> get<00:07:45.800> the<00:07:45.920> tempo<00:07:46.250> from<00:07:46.370> the<00:07:46.460> start<00:07:46.880> it's

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 
don't get the tempo from the start it's

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.900 
don't get the tempo from the start it's
it's<00:07:47.600> too<00:07:47.840> difficult<00:07:48.050> to<00:07:48.560> come<00:07:48.770> back<00:07:48.980> I<00:07:49.340> drew

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.410 
unbound with the spirituals but he could

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.880 
unbound with the spirituals but he could
deal<00:07:54.590> with<00:07:54.740> it<00:07:54.890> too<00:07:55.250> easy<00:07:55.460> and<00:07:56.560> yeah<00:07:57.560> he<00:07:57.740> drew
