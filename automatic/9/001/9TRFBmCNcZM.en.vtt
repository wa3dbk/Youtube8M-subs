00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.550 
of blowing the mic out on a real high
pitch<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> flip<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.440> it'll

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
pitch you can flip it to that and it'll

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.650 
pitch you can flip it to that and it'll
cut<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.009> across<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.819> level<00:01:27.149> it<00:01:27.209> out<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
cut that across and level it out so

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.480 
cut that across and level it out so
another<00:01:28.170> good<00:01:28.440> option<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.860> add<00:01:29.099> to<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
another good option to add to this

not<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.989> most<00:02:01.170> compact<00:02:01.849> so<00:02:02.849> if<00:02:02.940> you're<00:02:03.060> going

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
not the most compact so if you're going

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.139 
not the most compact so if you're going
on<00:02:03.630> long<00:02:04.050> backcountry<00:02:04.500> trip<00:02:04.890> may<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:05.819> may<00:02:05.970> not

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
on long backcountry trip may or may not

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.520 
on long backcountry trip may or may not
want<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.450> take<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.959> very<00:02:07.259> lightweight

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
want to take it it is very lightweight

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.729 
want to take it it is very lightweight
but<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.599> 8<00:02:10.380> inches

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
but you know it is you know 8 inches

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.059 
but you know it is you know 8 inches
long<00:02:10.800> 10<00:02:11.459> inches<00:02:11.760> long<00:02:11.970> there<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.860> up<00:02:14.040> to

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
long 10 inches long there so it's up to
