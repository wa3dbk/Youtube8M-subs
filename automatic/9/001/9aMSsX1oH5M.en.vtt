00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.660
 although there is no guts yet 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.750
 This day 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.210
 is a beautiful day 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.970
 because i am in italy 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.710
 but still here I am now fourteen is in Turkey and bye 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.749
 want one 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.139
 today we do have regular over today 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.619
 And alpha mb cache for you is a one thing that has been getting bad lately 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.409
 popular as a little weird 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.590
 started with 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.130
 yes but they started that whole desire is very big 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.630
 but they number of species has often been a success 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.960
 inside 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.280
 steam 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.399
 just the strp steam 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.720
 where say 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.530
 the eta already pay value for money and that is a kind of cloud family better 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.110
 that's what the van called 9 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.149
 and there are hooks and eyes to a second term 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.429
 because that is not only good what we are doing at the moment as 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.429
 consumers said 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.390
 the city 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.790
 the five 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.960
 five and six years ago a better free and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 game still participate in it and the open and the red due to giving up 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.410
 However, again missing some players still make a profit out of the 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.310
 traditional way 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.680
 the fact that you say but I think I don't think he's good at that 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.670
 good consultation 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.259
 that gives you, as it were 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.990
 jacobson army that you are allowed to play 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.030
 great fair exchange 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 and that is exactly what a bit of a weekend has tried of 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.610
 nowadays it is a bit too high for the idea that it is ordinary 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.990
 bank card ensure that will again 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.320
 often a lagging market has started 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 nowadays it is that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 someone makes a kind of prototype of a game with alpha that is for better it 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.270
 is a game get say really bad excuse of higher 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.690
 very many Germans very many are not able to agree in one go 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.750
 expect 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.880
 after a great 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.210
 it's about people who pay for him it's very strange because in that get 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.340
 For example, things that Assad was purchased 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.039
 she referred to turning 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.600
 spacious 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.709
 the construction that we are the only thing i do not often but 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.620
 The case games that did not work at all with a lot of things but I did 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.249
 also no agreement reached a lot of things not in small things 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.279
 disappeared and everything 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.159
 what i am trying to say is 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.020
 there is a new market the market for people who 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.849
 just buy games even if they are not ready yet 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.790
 and the players are going to be the ab inbev the publisher says paul cremona 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.389
 ordinary weekday I think you have something funny the marble that if 10 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:39.880
 the copper for 20 euros incl there were a lot of potential 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.590
 a lot of people are going to bring in all of that in recent days like that 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.370
 all of them 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.920
 and then they have earned a lot of money 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.040
 he may be even more than to continue working afterwards 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.189
 so what happens sometimes is that we just leave the project completely 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.719
 And according to another state project and what you get then you will feel this 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.610
 always with those annoying eta that are never finished 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.299
 paid 20 euros with the bell 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.499
 for something that is actually half a game 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.019
 that is actually not a good thing at all because well you don't see yourself either 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.150
 throwing away hail with money it is of course much wiser to 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.669
 wait until I think work from his stomach it is difficult to keep our team 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:14.689
 I understand that too 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.959
 we also do not have full debt that are safer now also shots 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.369
 what you also get is, for example, things like later there is still seen 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.159
 president anibal 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.999
 start between the four women intentions and get hospitals in the city beebe 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.330
 only a lot of promises 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.680
 and the more money that goes into the way soldiers keep their promise 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.289
 to the church 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:39.469
 currently stuck at a level with the previous 38 million 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.319
 picked up 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.049
 we are at the level that pleases me and I no longer feasible that it 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.599
 in everyone 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.409
 the piece is so ambitious project of the year may interfere with much too early 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.040
 passed away 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.499
 that is not too bad 280 million was not a c5 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.659
 and start will stand up against santo you ask to be ambitious from maybe 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:59.580
 even worse 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.509
 because they also have a fellow studio 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.579
 anyway chances are that you will all make money in the start vincent and 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.269
 then the game may never be released 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.130
 which can 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.789
 besides of all the money was supposed 30 million is gone 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:17.229
 about the game comes out and it is not expected at all though many features are bolt 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.340
 as towering 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.309
 rachel marston that there was so much ing it wasn't 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.959
 wise what further to choose especially if there is also 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.470
 one hundred thousand extra 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.970
 then we are going to do the blast into the band of girls 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.800
 such a handy one 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.740
 mdm as it used to be built up by my arm for burma andisha 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.059
 from a large selection of the project a plan a step-by-step plan part of it 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.800
 Roadmap crashed against Aberdeen the stopping and want this to happen this way 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.470
 we make 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.289
 and so on 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.919
 inciting to the market we are crazy trips 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:51.620
 there are no 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.990
 so nothing and it can not let go fishing 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 we just have to be good we are ready says that made 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.340
 fantastic models 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.610
 fantastic modeling life the 18 and then I have to understand my life 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.889
 only motherwell be careful with it i want in July as a consumer and i as 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.910
 consumer we don't just have to throw money everywhere optimally 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.009
 it's not smart 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.150
 I have plenty of that 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.020
 purchased these systems 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.770
 Here I do regret rather regret that game that doesn't work 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.080
 it doesn't matter where all 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.830
 the pace is 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.710
 say yes and then about it 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.930
 the game is just really not 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.150
 prevent this form of subsidiary guitars 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.550
 and it's waning 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.850
 was harmful for almost 30 euros 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.650
 and everyone buys 30 euros and a lot of people where they had gone 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.249
 enlarge 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.839
 was just not much fun 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.719
 You also know best selling encourages some incest dancing with acting dancing 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.659
 or the game ever made 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.259
 it is then full of beers 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.569
 no to say what I could find this boy and the mole of the newspaper on the 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.099
 was the advice 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.509
 I thought that was very cool 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.379
 but the pass from that pass 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.189
 for my feeling back in the series a see the Nazis i'm sure but it 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.940
 number of families and it all works and 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.319
 work therein 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.499
 and this time I am not yet because she had been there from the beginning 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.740
 no wooden November 20 I saw a kickstart idea what I can do I don't know 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.810
 how they fire 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.900
 the checks will result 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.240
 in addition to care 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.869
 So 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.869
 That is a lesson of today had to keep an eye on what you are buying, definitely alpha 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.919
 petajisto doesn't just look at anything that looks very nice, most 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.849
 sports for us it is really worth it 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.349
 and in some cases I will advise them to download it to 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.270
 exercise too large and watch 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.510
 what i actually think i'm better just again 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.169
 must bring free that is really just cheek 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.930
 yes, because at the moment you hang out, you are thrown against the window 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.840
 say no, says mittal 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.479
 it all gets much better 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.970
 but the deficits already 30 euros then you actually have that you should not say there 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:56.509
 because 30 euros was bought 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.110
 nevertheless offer a good be 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.029
 paying for what for his debut 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.770
 I don't buy a pon behind denis anyway but that actually happened 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.020
 that's one of them 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.430
 also a time of watching 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.430
 and much more 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.919
 who to give the interview 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.919
 we sit 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.469
 what nonsense 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:25.979
 I find him 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.509
 czech on fire 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:28.419
 it was about
