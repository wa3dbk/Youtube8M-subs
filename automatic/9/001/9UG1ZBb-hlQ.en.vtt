00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.930

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 boats from a regular boat so now 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.800
 collect himself himself a balloon is on 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:00.420
 sides of the motor and bottom of the boat top of the balloon and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 the stove because the ball itself works on 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.220
 corner and so we get ready 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.560
 balloon now let's test 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.010
 it means so still moment 1 means in 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.300
 settings need to go later 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.590
 management and here are specifically three 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.580
 buttons for this mod set means 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.570

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.330
 put x and z x7 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.160
 that means we sit down with the right mouse button and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.160
 here we are moving 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.200
 but Iâ€™m not pushing these buttons 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.940
 I can climb this and because I need 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.280
 coal so now i will take coal 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.580
 a little bit because this is a fuel shield 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.040
 You see, as if the engine is on fire Ltd. Where 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.600
 where are you you can not sit so here I am 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.259
 sit down press r here 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 put it all 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.690
 and here he will stand so gradually 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.510
 to spend 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:16.470
 I push us in and voila I rise here 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.640
 and as if everything is now on 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.920
 of he very quickly goes down on ces 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:30.660
 shoots on the idea should shoot a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.350
 I probably need an arrow so click on 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.800
 r 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 here he shoots the truth is he somehow askew 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.170
 shoots and what else is here 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.300
 if you fly here can 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.460
 appear beta air pirates 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:52.360
 so come on let's try now 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:56.040
 find them and finally i have already found 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.780
 I flew pirates for about 10 minutes looking for them 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.540
 so go to this mode 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:07.120
 and here they are something like this somewhere there he they 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.850
 also archery now more often I 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:19.540
 now try to knock them down and see 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:22.660
 that they fall out so no such 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.240
 here when I let them stand on the ground 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.300
 Immediately shoot and here they do not want something 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.610
 and managing something so hard 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.550
 I 'll probably go down now and old 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.420
 oh no damn way I accidentally clicked 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:43.850
 shift and fall out so now they will go down and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:53.170
 will not shoot I'll take a bow a couple of arrows 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:58.340
 enough I will try to shoot down a pancake high reptiles 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.530
 then try your ball knock down method three 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:09.940
 shot and he should in theory 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:09.940
 fall to well here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:23.640
 the ball falls and we rise up now 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.110
 Now they are flying away or they are afraid 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.360
 they shoot back a little 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.900
 shoot back and now I have you all the same 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.280
 I will score 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:44.050
 come on come on come on come on 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:52.270
 let 's all finally see 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:58.890
 what happened to them so little experience can be seen 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.890
 and along the way it's all 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:09.930
 and arrows in general yes the catch is small 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:12.810
 okay come back then though though 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.909
 here more and more I did not notice anyone in 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.409
 general pirates appear quite often 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:22.409
 especially if you are furniture 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:24.629
