00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 what is the diaphragm first the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.240
 diaphragm these are slats that get 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.460
 find inside your lens 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.650
 and that's where they can leave 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.679
 to spend more or less light and that's 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.480
 what's called the opening at each 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.220
 opening values ​​corresponds to a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 diameter 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.060
 I put you here the values 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.260
 opening hours and to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.529
 every time I go from an opening 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.949
 to the other I double the light that goes 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.859
 reach my sensors and as you the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:45.020
 see opening be notes this way f 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:47.969
 slash 2.8 f slash 4 5 6 8 11 f-16 f-22 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.350
 obviously between each of these 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.190
 values ​​there are values 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.149
 intermediaries in general by number of 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 three one third one third one third 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.059
 so why an opening f / 2 8 is 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.860
 bigger than opening af 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 is fine because it's a report of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.990
 Focal / opening 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 take an example you have a goal 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.720
 in the focal length and 50 mm and you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:23.909
 set an aperture at 2.8 50 / of 8 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.229
 that gives 17.86 and if I pass 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 opening at 8 50 10/8 that gives me 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.189
 6.25 which is a figure smaller than 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.759
 17 86 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.350
 which is why the diameter of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.070
 the opening of the diaphragm a8 is no longer 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.079
 small as 2.8 and so on 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 if I put an opening at 22 I'll have a 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.520
 diameter of global fragments still 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 smaller so I would let it go 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.299
 even less light at the time of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.340
 the exhibition 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.290
 as a rule when you turn 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.600
 the opening wheel on your SLR 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.040
 these increase or decrease by 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.219
 1/3 increments 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 sometimes it can be half so you 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.060
 to check in the manual of your 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.880
 camera 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.880
 if your device is set to 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.180
 increase or decrease the aperture 1/3 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.740
 at every notch and well at every step 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.090
 match an opening value a 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.360
 Shooting larger or smaller 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.310
 accordingly when you turn the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.950
 wheel three times in the same direction 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.650
 you double up or down 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.010
 the opening because a shot plus a third 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.370
 plus one-third equals three-thirds equal 1 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.400
 which amounts to getting 100% of 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.920
 light in more or less directly 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.200
 towards your sensor we also say that we 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.190
 has doubled the light that reaches the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 sensors in more or less and it says 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.150
 also that it corresponds to more than a stop 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.950
 or less a stop 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.950
 but that's the subject of another video
