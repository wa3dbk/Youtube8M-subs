00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:13.340
 I know you're here, you can leave the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.320
 who wants me with clear symbols 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.609
 sooner or later someone will ask 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 to learn someone with authority 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:27.590
 and when it happened this happens 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.590
 Of course, the best of both of us wins. 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 bruce it's time to leave the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:43.579
 our differences cold and we work 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 together because what do you mean why 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.199
 You are Batman and I have no power. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 especially no, I'm basically rich 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.289
 and crazy and I care bruce your mind 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.670
 extremely fully scientifically 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.989
 useless when there's a guy who can 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 literally reflect the bars you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.630
 know how to put my biggest enemy is the good that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.840
 it's just a big man pummeled with the mask 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.299
 gas and he broke my back. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.110
 you would end it with your hand only and with 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.570
 the other hand 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:26.420
 You could hit a super that I just 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 I think is cool 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 I understand, you have a problem. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.600

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 You're boring, look at you with this. 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 My father gave me this clothes and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.880
 the father died 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.460
 see if the death of the father and the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.460
 mother but her parents died did not 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.130
 remember that 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.939
 I was just a boy 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.430
 and now I 'm a bat to excuse the 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.579
 my clothes are cool because I did 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.310
 She alone, your daddy's little boy. 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.959
 has a fucking one on the chest of the house 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.970
 forget who this is the symbol of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.130
 hope of my people hope begins 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.300
 Eye makeup will take on the ass 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.010
 I could not get my powers to bear 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.580
 a different atmosphere 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.450
 george leaves gate his asshole 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 Shit 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.730
 with this fucking super batman hair 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.470
 maxi is not connected you're thinking 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.510
 now a batman hero we were 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.900
 discussing a type partnership for 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.970
 what 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 and that's what I said, this is it 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.950
 totally unnecessary truth I read 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.340
 ten years ago as native as you but 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.510
 I do not think they're going to come down, but I 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.400
 I agree with Batman 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.290
 What a good thing you're acting. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.739
 so someone had to tell the truth 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.650
 You're boring, you're up to your alter ego. 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.200
 I chose autumn type fuck of the playboy 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.540
 and you chose what one of the batons 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.880
 is what it is that I do not base my alter 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.510
 ego in the movie the batutinhas as the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.190
 you base or clark kent was the 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 alpha I'm not in favor and another with a 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.819
 strong impression that there is a gap I 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.530
 I already said that I'm not him, I'd rather 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.880
 that we did not say that on the front 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.980
 of the commissioner 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.650
 I found alpha I know you of course it is 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.690
 What 's for the record is a 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.459
 little more than a hat and glasses 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.299
 still in people 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:34.049
 Kaka only there, he thought, I also am not 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.750
 the commissioner because he was going to 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.100
 commissioner gordon 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.670
 Oh, you came back. There was another one. 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.889

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.790

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.579
 In the shadows 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.459
 The channel already forget, forget it all. 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.810
 Okay, maybe all this bullshit is 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.990
 one of the reasons you never had 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.950
 The night is consummated. 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:04.250
 one leaves them out of it she is always 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.400
 giving a naughty reporter and if 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.780
 playing straight into his goal face was 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.140
 urgent news 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.880

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.810

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.790
 it would be novelty 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.150
 You always use this for the beast thing. 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.820

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.310

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.590
 It's too cold, my lady. 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.580
 I would use this to pluck the arms 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.130
