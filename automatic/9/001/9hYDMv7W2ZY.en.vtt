00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
video blog on the wagon pedal last week

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.579 
video blog on the wagon pedal last week
we<00:00:05.850> talked<00:00:06.029> about<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:06.990> octave<00:00:07.290> up<00:00:07.410> and

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
we talked about the two octave up and

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.440 
we talked about the two octave up and
one<00:00:07.740> octave<00:00:08.040> up<00:00:08.130> function<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.970> pedal<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
one octave up function of the pedal and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.910 
one octave up function of the pedal and
I<00:00:09.540> think<00:00:09.750> that's<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> most

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
I think that's the one of the most

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
I think that's the one of the most
commonly<00:00:11.280> used<00:00:11.370> function<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.809> week<00:00:12.990> we'll

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
commonly used function this week we'll

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.440 
commonly used function this week we'll

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
as I mentioned in last video my approach

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.820 
as I mentioned in last video my approach
to<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.330> harmony<00:00:18.660> section<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.170> not<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.650> sound

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
to the harmony section is not to sound

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.260 
to the harmony section is not to sound
like<00:00:20.160> when<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> guitar<00:00:20.880> player<00:00:21.090> is

like when the guitar player is

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150 
like when the guitar player is
harmonizing<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.109> me<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.890> more<00:00:23.130> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
rhythmic pattern with my foot I'm

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740 
rhythmic pattern with my foot I'm
actually<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.620> turning<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.539> sounds<00:00:45.539> easy

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
actually just turning it on sounds easy

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.049 
actually just turning it on sounds easy
but<00:00:46.010> keep<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> mind<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.789> be

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
but keep in mind that you have to be

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
but keep in mind that you have to be
doing<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.870> while<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.350> playing<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> melody

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
doing this while you playing the melody

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.830 
doing this while you playing the melody
and<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> melody<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.879> complicated<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and if the melody is complicated it is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
and if the melody is complicated it is
not<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.230> easy<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> keep<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.879> mind<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
not that easy so keep that in mind and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:37.190 
not that easy so keep that in mind and
here's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> video
