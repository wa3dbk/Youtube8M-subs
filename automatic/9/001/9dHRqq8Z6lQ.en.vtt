00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hello everybody Caleb again I finally

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.160 
hello everybody Caleb again I finally
got<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:05.850> more<00:00:05.940> things<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.270> talk<00:00:06.509> about<00:00:06.569> on<00:00:06.990> my

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
got some more things to talk about on my

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.890 
got some more things to talk about on my
shape<00:00:07.560> oco-2<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:09.240> think<00:00:09.420> I'll<00:00:09.540> start<00:00:09.719> off

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
shape oco-2 and I think I'll start off

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.030 
shape oco-2 and I think I'll start off
with<00:00:10.219> first<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.929> aluminum<00:00:12.929> t-slot<00:00:13.650> bed

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
with first with this aluminum t-slot bed

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.420 
with first with this aluminum t-slot bed
that<00:00:14.280> I've<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.549> mounted<00:00:14.969> up<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:16.130> the<00:00:17.130> idea

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
that I've got mounted up on it the idea

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240 
that I've got mounted up on it the idea
here<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.449> using<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.350> milling

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
here is that I'm using it for milling

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.960 
here is that I'm using it for milling
some<00:00:20.490> aluminum<00:00:20.939> die<00:00:21.720> cast<00:00:21.750> metal<00:00:22.820> cases<00:00:23.820> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
some aluminum die cast metal cases that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.490 
some aluminum die cast metal cases that
are<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.330> used<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.570> guitar<00:00:24.960> pedals

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
are going to be used for guitar pedals

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.529 
are going to be used for guitar pedals
and<00:00:25.710> stuff<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.130> want<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> experiment<00:00:27.330> with

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and stuff and I want to experiment with

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.910 
and stuff and I want to experiment with
that<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> I've<00:00:29.010> got<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:30.080> cam<00:00:31.080> clamps<00:00:31.560> that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that so I've got some cam clamps that

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
that so I've got some cam clamps that
basically<00:00:32.630> have<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.780> eccentric<00:00:34.910> like<00:00:35.910> not

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
basically have an eccentric like not

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
basically have an eccentric like not
basically<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.020> them<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.920> has<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.520> t

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
basically on them and it has a little t

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.330 
basically on them and it has a little t
slot<00:00:39.170> thing<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.379> basically<00:00:40.800> allows<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
slot thing that basically allows it to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.580 
slot thing that basically allows it to
connect<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:42.989> slide<00:00:43.320> right<00:00:43.559> on

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
connect and then you know slide right on

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.400 
connect and then you know slide right on
to<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:48.649> but<00:00:49.649> basically<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.050> think

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
to there so but basically it's I think

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.459 
to there so but basically it's I think
250<00:00:53.340> millimeters<00:00:53.850> by<00:00:54.360> 500<00:00:55.020> millimeters

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
250 millimeters by 500 millimeters

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.779 
250 millimeters by 500 millimeters
exactly<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.699> close<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.520> got<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
exactly or close to that and I got it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.149 
exactly or close to that and I got it
from<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.359> Mizzou<00:01:01.199> me<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.739> me<00:01:02.070> zooming<00:01:02.430> USA

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
from I think Mizzou me or me zooming USA

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.179 
from I think Mizzou me or me zooming USA
and<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.760> very<00:01:06.330> nice<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:07.049> lot<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.890> different

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and it's very nice a lot of different

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
and it's very nice a lot of different
ways<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.520> mount<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> there's<00:01:09.260> holes

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
ways you can mount it there's holes

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
ways you can mount it there's holes
along<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.450> drilled<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
along here that can be drilled and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320 
along here that can be drilled and
tapped<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:14.130> could<00:01:14.250> mount<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.580> along<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> side

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
tapped you could mount it along the side

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
tapped you could mount it along the side
here<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.869> ended<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.619> drilling<00:01:17.100> holes<00:01:18.650> 10

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
here I ended up drilling holes 10

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
here I ended up drilling holes 10
millimeters<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.180> drilling<00:01:21.689> them

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
millimeters in and then drilling them

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.039 
millimeters in and then drilling them
and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.890> made<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.460> bit<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:24.049> larger

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and then I made a little bit of a larger

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
and then I made a little bit of a larger
drill<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> could<00:01:26.250> fit<00:01:26.460> screws

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
drill right there so I could fit screws

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.280 
drill right there so I could fit screws
right<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.240> into<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> points<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.290> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
right down into the points there so that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
right down into the points there so that
worked<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.740> well<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:34.880> I'm

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
worked really well I think but I'm

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
worked really well I think but I'm
hoping<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.329> works<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.140> I'm

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
hoping that works out good and I'm

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
hoping that works out good and I'm
hoping<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> video<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.220> showing

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
hoping I can have a video out showing

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.719 
hoping I can have a video out showing
off<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.250> test<00:01:41.490> project

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
off a little bit of of a test project

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
off a little bit of of a test project
where<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.329> milling<00:01:42.720> or<00:01:42.899> engraving<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.920> some

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
where I'm milling or engraving on some

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.719 
where I'm milling or engraving on some
aluminum<00:01:44.570> die<00:01:45.570> cast<00:01:45.600> aluminum<00:01:46.579> project<00:01:47.579> bot

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
aluminum die cast aluminum project bot

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
aluminum die cast aluminum project bot
boxes<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.200> look<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.810> basically<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
boxes so look for that but basically the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.050 
boxes so look for that but basically the
other<00:01:52.740> thing<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.070> I've<00:01:53.310> done<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:56.060> i've

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
other thing that I've done is I i've

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
other thing that I've done is I i've
ground<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:57.600> these<00:01:57.840> fiberglass<00:01:58.259> belt<00:01:58.740> clips

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
ground down these fiberglass belt clips

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.020 
ground down these fiberglass belt clips
and<00:01:59.899> basically<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.770> allows<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and basically that allows it so that the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.459 
and basically that allows it so that the
V<00:02:03.210> wheels<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.860> just<00:02:04.969> can<00:02:05.969> travel<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:07.079> V<00:02:07.259> wheels

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
V wheels I just can travel the V wheels

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.830 
V wheels I just can travel the V wheels
can<00:02:08.129> move<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> end

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
can move all the way to the end

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.070 
can move all the way to the end
basically<00:02:10.739> which

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
basically which

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
basically which
undoubtedly<00:02:13.080> help<00:02:13.620> give<00:02:14.010> me<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.459> bit

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
undoubtedly help give me a little bit

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.120 
undoubtedly help give me a little bit
more<00:02:14.819> travel<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.500> I've<00:02:16.620> done<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
more travel and I've done it on the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.550 
more travel and I've done it on the
x-axis<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.330> x-axis<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:19.080> probably<00:02:19.470> not

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
x-axis to the x-axis it's probably not

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.020 
x-axis to the x-axis it's probably not
as<00:02:19.790> important<00:02:20.790> because<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.500> gantry<00:02:23.069> can<00:02:23.640> if

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
as important because the gantry can if

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.449 
as important because the gantry can if
it<00:02:24.450> tries<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.780> travel<00:02:25.319> too<00:02:25.440> far<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:26.099> actually

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
it tries to travel too far will actually

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.820 
it tries to travel too far will actually
hit<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.940> lot<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.300> mechanics<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.239> y-axis

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
hit a lot of the mechanics of the y-axis

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.170 
hit a lot of the mechanics of the y-axis
but<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.040> reason<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.400> did<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> anyways<00:02:32.970> is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
but the reason I did it anyways is

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.699 
but the reason I did it anyways is
because<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.569> wanted<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.930> able<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> pull<00:02:34.530> this

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
because I wanted to be able to pull this

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.650 
because I wanted to be able to pull this
in<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> little<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.120> tightened

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
in a little bit so that when I tightened

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
in a little bit so that when I tightened
it<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.410> easier<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.920> tighten<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:38.670> um

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
it was easier to tighten up these um

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.530 
it was easier to tighten up these um
belts<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.260> they<00:02:40.410> were<00:02:40.470> well<00:02:40.739> tensioned

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
belts so that they were well tensioned

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
belts so that they were well tensioned
so<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.620> reason<00:02:43.980> why<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.100> did

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
so that's really the reason why I did

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
so that's really the reason why I did
there<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.090> was<00:02:45.180> another<00:02:45.390> reason<00:02:45.480> why<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
there and that was another reason why I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.650 
there and that was another reason why I
opted<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.130> these<00:02:47.430> around<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.540> y

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
opted to do it on these around the y

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.309 
opted to do it on these around the y
axis<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:50.069> that's<00:02:50.489> basically<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.110> where<00:02:52.290> I

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
axis so that's basically kind of where I

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.130 
axis so that's basically kind of where I
am<00:02:52.410> right<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:53.610> everything<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:57.019> trying<00:02:58.019> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
am right now on everything and trying to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.479 
am right now on everything and trying to
think<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:58.440> there's<00:02:58.470> anything<00:02:58.950> else<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.340> I

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
think if there's anything else that I

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.400 
think if there's anything else that I
want<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> talk<00:03:00.030> about<00:03:00.239> right<00:03:00.540> now<00:03:02.480> nope<00:03:03.510> so

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
want to talk about right now nope so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.320 
want to talk about right now nope so
thanks<00:03:04.920> for<00:03:05.010> watching<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.819> was<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> short

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
thanks for watching this was a short

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.270 
thanks for watching this was a short
video<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.840> don't<00:03:07.170> forget<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.160> you

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
