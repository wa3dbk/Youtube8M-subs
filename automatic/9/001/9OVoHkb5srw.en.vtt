that<00:05:02.080> there<00:05:02.229> was<00:05:02.289> something<00:05:02.530> wrong<00:05:02.800> with<00:05:02.979> them

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
that there was something wrong with them

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.399 
that there was something wrong with them
and<00:05:03.370> at<00:05:03.820> that<00:05:03.970> thing<00:05:04.210> wrong<00:05:04.449> was<00:05:04.599> biochemical

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
and at that thing wrong was biochemical

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.040 
and at that thing wrong was biochemical
and<00:05:05.860> if<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.340> could<00:05:06.520> then<00:05:06.759> be<00:05:06.789> treated<00:05:07.539> by<00:05:07.720> a

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
and if that could then be treated by a

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.469 
and if that could then be treated by a
drug<00:05:08.349> which<00:05:08.560> was<00:05:08.770> supposed<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.430> cure<00:05:09.729> all<00:05:09.940> and

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
drug which was supposed to cure all and

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.409 
drug which was supposed to cure all and
so<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.050> was<00:05:11.199> relatively<00:05:11.770> easy<00:05:11.889> I<00:05:12.250> think<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.909> say

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
so it was relatively easy I think to say

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.969 
so it was relatively easy I think to say
well<00:05:13.659> look<00:05:13.810> let's<00:05:14.020> start<00:05:14.349> looking<00:05:14.470> at<00:05:14.710> mental
