00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
camera it's really not it's like a very

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
deep aubergine color and I really look

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.400 
deep aubergine color and I really look
forward<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.640> seeing<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> Sun<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.320> you

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
forward to seeing that in the Sun so you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.000 
forward to seeing that in the Sun so you
can<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.830> true<00:03:08.100> color<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.640> pop<00:03:09.000> out

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
can see the true color really pop out

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.600 
can see the true color really pop out
next<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.250> Tate<00:03:11.840> which<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.500> classic<00:03:13.950> red

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
next is Tate which is just a classic red

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.910 
next is Tate which is just a classic red
cream<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.390> think<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.020> could<00:03:16.260> find<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.650> place<00:03:16.890> in

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
cream I think that could find a place in

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.199 
cream I think that could find a place in
just<00:03:17.370> about<00:03:17.580> anybody's<00:03:18.209> collection<00:03:18.780> and

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
just about anybody's collection and

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.740 
just about anybody's collection and
finally<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.660> lower<00:03:22.380> Regent<00:03:22.890> Street<00:03:23.130> and

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
finally we have lower Regent Street and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.050 
finally we have lower Regent Street and
this<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> very<00:03:25.140> bright<00:03:25.560> pink<00:03:26.010> not<00:03:26.519> quite<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
this is a very bright pink not quite a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.509 
this is a very bright pink not quite a
neon<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.620> summer<00:03:28.950> right<00:03:29.160> around<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
neon but with summer right around the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.160 
neon but with summer right around the
corner<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:30.060> think<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.600> would<00:03:30.660> make<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> great

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
corner I think that would make a great

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.550 
corner I think that would make a great
pedicure<00:03:31.620> color<00:03:32.220> or<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.720> your<00:03:34.050> nails<00:03:34.290> to

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
pedicure color or just on your nails to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.090 
pedicure color or just on your nails to
get<00:03:34.920> ready<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:35.519> spring<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.030> summer<00:03:37.100> moving

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
get ready for spring and summer moving

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.060 
get ready for spring and summer moving
on<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.790> miniature<00:03:39.390> bottles<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:40.680> first

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
on to the miniature bottles this first

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.890 
on to the miniature bottles this first
one<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:42.200> upper<00:03:43.200> Brook<00:03:43.410> Street<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.840> a

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
one is upper Brook Street and this is a

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.580 
one is upper Brook Street and this is a
very<00:03:46.530> oily<00:03:47.250> metallic<00:03:48.239> blue<00:03:49.549> then<00:03:50.549> we<00:03:50.820> have

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
very oily metallic blue then we have

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.860 
very oily metallic blue then we have
Westminster<00:03:52.590> Abbey<00:03:52.860> which<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.360> bright

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
shining gold foil this I think is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.620

rainbow glitter to any polish could

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.969 
rainbow glitter to any polish could
definitely<00:04:24.570> go<00:04:24.810> over<00:04:25.050> any<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.530> colors<00:04:25.710> in

dull<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.460> base<00:04:29.669> color<00:04:30.000> or<00:04:30.450> make<00:04:30.630> it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
dull the base color or make it

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.780
