a<00:03:05.290> pink<00:03:06.290> Cadillac<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.370> too<00:03:07.550> funny

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
a pink Cadillac that is just too funny

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.250 
a pink Cadillac that is just too funny
and<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:11.270> has<00:03:11.570> again<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.110> 3.6<00:03:12.980> liter<00:03:13.190> v6<00:03:14.260> I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
and this has again the 3.6 liter v6 I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.320 
and this has again the 3.6 liter v6 I
think<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.950> 2.8<00:03:16.550> liter<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.120> one<00:03:17.240> that's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
think the 2.8 liter is the one that's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:27.610 
think the 2.8 liter is the one that's
turbocharged

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.699 

so<00:03:28.190> it's<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.519> for<00:03:28.790> sale<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.030> think<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.319> Mary

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
so it's not for sale I think it's a Mary

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.089 
so it's not for sale I think it's a Mary
Kay<00:03:31.069> vehicle<00:03:31.819> or<00:03:32.319> someone<00:03:33.319> actually<00:03:33.590> some

private person did actually custom order

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.100 
private person did actually custom order
this<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:38.239> why<00:03:38.450> it's<00:03:38.599> not<00:03:38.720> for<00:03:38.959> sale

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
this and that's why it's not for sale

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.600 
this and that's why it's not for sale
this<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.409> actually<00:03:39.739> someone's<00:03:40.099> carve<00:03:40.400> a

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
this is actually someone's carve a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.180 
this is actually someone's carve a
custom<00:03:40.970> order<00:03:42.580> there's<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.730> backup<00:03:44.209> sensors

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
custom order there's the backup sensors

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.009 
custom order there's the backup sensors
it's<00:03:46.190> got<00:03:46.340> dual<00:03:46.670> exhaust<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.450> think<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.840> has

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
it's got dual exhaust I think this has

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.979 
it's got dual exhaust I think this has
like<00:03:48.170> 300<00:03:48.829> horsepower<00:03:49.510> don't<00:03:50.510> quote<00:03:50.750> me<00:03:50.959> on

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
like 300 horsepower don't quote me on

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.270 
like 300 horsepower don't quote me on
that<00:03:51.110> but<00:03:51.290> i<00:03:51.470> think<00:03:51.530> it's<00:03:51.829> about<00:03:52.010> 300

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
that but i think it's about 300

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.319 
that but i think it's about 300
horsepower<00:03:53.230> maybe<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.349> little<00:03:54.560> more<00:03:54.829> i<00:03:58.329> don't

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
horsepower maybe a little more i don't

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.059 
horsepower maybe a little more i don't
know<00:03:59.420> if<00:03:59.450> it's<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.750> direct<00:04:00.140> injection<00:04:00.560> or<00:04:00.890> not

know if it's the direct injection or not

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.890 
know if it's the direct injection or not
i<00:04:01.099> know<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.700> when<00:04:02.060> they<00:04:02.150> first<00:04:02.450> came<00:04:02.840> out

i know that when they first came out

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.740 
i know that when they first came out
with<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.290> redesigned<00:04:03.799> cts<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.700> had<00:04:04.879> on<00:04:05.150> a

or<00:04:13.430> 280<00:04:14.060> horsepower<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.959> then<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.709> direct

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
or 280 horsepower and then the direct

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.659 
or 280 horsepower and then the direct

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
inject version that had 304 so i don't

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.009
