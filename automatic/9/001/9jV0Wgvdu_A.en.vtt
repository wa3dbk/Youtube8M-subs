00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
see so that's the number one limitation

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.280 
see so that's the number one limitation
allopathic<00:02:06.049> thinking<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:08.679> of<00:02:09.880> course<00:02:10.900> this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
allopathic thinking and of course this

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.720 
allopathic thinking and of course this
is<00:02:13.849> clearly<00:02:14.849> shown<00:02:14.969> not<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.659> be<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.959> case<00:02:15.989> in

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
is clearly shown not to be the case in

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.690 
is clearly shown not to be the case in
in<00:02:17.730> systems<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.269> homeopathy<00:02:19.040> there<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.340> see

in systems like homeopathy there you see

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
in systems like homeopathy there you see

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
disease named people have but the people

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.620 
disease named people have but the people
who<00:03:35.170> express<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.740> disease<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.180> would<00:03:38.420> go

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
who express the disease so I would go

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.260 
who express the disease so I would go
even<00:03:38.840> as<00:03:39.080> far<00:03:39.320> as<00:03:39.560> homeopathy<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.790> homeopathy

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
even as far as homeopathy in homeopathy

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.270 
even as far as homeopathy in homeopathy
there<00:03:41.750> are<00:03:41.930> no<00:03:42.110> disease<00:03:42.530> names<00:03:42.860> really

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
there are no disease names really

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.949 
there are no disease names really
there's<00:03:44.150> only<00:03:44.420> symptoms<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:47.420> homeopathy

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
there's only symptoms so in homeopathy

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.680 
there's only symptoms so in homeopathy
they<00:03:48.680> went<00:03:48.920> one<00:03:49.220> step<00:03:49.400> further<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.240> this<00:03:50.480> was

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
they went one step further and this was

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.070 
they went one step further and this was
like<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.140> invention<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.709> Hanuman<00:03:53.080> basically

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
like the invention of Hanuman basically

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.570 
like the invention of Hanuman basically
almost<00:03:54.320> 200<00:03:55.100> years<00:03:55.160> ago<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:56.560> he<00:03:57.560> was<00:03:57.830> against

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
almost 200 years ago that he was against

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.110 
almost 200 years ago that he was against
using<00:03:58.910> any<00:03:59.330> disease<00:03:59.810> names<00:04:00.110> but<00:04:00.800> just<00:04:01.120> making

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
using any disease names but just making

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.370 
using any disease names but just making
a<00:04:02.450> repertory<00:04:03.050> of<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:05.300> symptoms<00:04:05.780> somebody

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
a repertory of the symptoms somebody

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.670 
a repertory of the symptoms somebody
expression<00:04:07.070> expresses<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.150> then<00:04:08.530> finding<00:04:09.530> a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
expression expresses and then finding a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.820 
expression expresses and then finding a
matching<00:04:09.920> remedy<00:04:10.700> which<00:04:10.910> also<00:04:11.420> has<00:04:12.200> expressed

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
matching remedy which also has expressed

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.750 
matching remedy which also has expressed
this<00:04:13.100> kind<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.580> symptoms<00:04:13.970> in

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
this kind of symptoms in

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.370 
this kind of symptoms in
so<00:04:16.449> he<00:04:16.630> was<00:04:16.840> against<00:04:17.290> making<00:04:17.709> all<00:04:17.949> kind<00:04:18.370> of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
so he was against making all kind of

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.610 
so he was against making all kind of
theories<00:04:20.380> about<00:04:21.750> diseases<00:04:22.750> where<00:04:23.199> disease

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
theories about diseases where disease

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.580 
theories about diseases where disease
comes<00:04:23.979> from<00:04:24.419> why<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:25.479> disease<00:04:26.139> is<00:04:26.169> there

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
comes from why this disease is there

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.620 
comes from why this disease is there
like<00:04:26.889> today<00:04:27.280> we<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.639> certain<00:04:28.090> diseases

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
like today we have certain diseases

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.680 
like today we have certain diseases
where<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.020> say<00:04:29.229> they're<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:30.120> bacteria<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.389> they

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
where we say they're a bacteria is they

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.320 
where we say they're a bacteria is they
cause<00:04:32.020> our<00:04:32.350> virus<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.100> cause<00:04:33.370> or<00:04:33.789> fungus

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
cause our virus is the cause or fungus

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.110 
cause our virus is the cause or fungus
is<00:04:34.449> the<00:04:34.630> cause<00:04:34.870> or<00:04:34.900> some<00:04:36.120> electromagnetic

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
is the cause or some electromagnetic

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.159 
is the cause or some electromagnetic
pollution<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.350> cause<00:04:38.620> or<00:04:38.650> some<00:04:39.780> let's<00:04:40.780> say

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.600 

chemicals<00:04:44.169> in<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.680> environment<00:04:45.100> are

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
chemicals in the in the environment are

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.080 
chemicals in the in the environment are
the<00:04:45.820> cause<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:46.690> we<00:04:46.810> all<00:04:47.350> make<00:04:47.620> those<00:04:48.090> those

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
the cause so we all make those those

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.430 
the cause so we all make those those
cause<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.780> effect<00:04:50.760> relationships<00:04:51.760> which<00:04:52.090> are

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
cause and effect relationships which are

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.820 
cause and effect relationships which are
very<00:04:53.440> much<00:04:53.740> against<00:04:55.320> thinking<00:04:56.320> in<00:04:56.440> terms<00:04:56.620> of

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
very much against thinking in terms of

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.990 
very much against thinking in terms of
homeopathy<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:58.289> but<00:04:59.289> they<00:04:59.530> were<00:04:59.590> always<00:05:00.000> in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
homeopathy and but they were always in

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.560 
homeopathy and but they were always in
the<00:05:01.479> line<00:05:01.660> of<00:05:02.580> always<00:05:03.580> what<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:03.940> other<00:05:04.389> is

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
the line of always what I other is

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.529 
the line of always what I other is
called<00:05:04.750> allopathic<00:05:05.289> thinking<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:07.150> the

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
called allopathic thinking the the

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.260 
called allopathic thinking the the
cause-and-effect<00:05:07.949> thinking<00:05:09.000> disease<00:05:10.000> is

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
cause-and-effect thinking disease is

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.580 
cause-and-effect thinking disease is
based<00:05:10.600> on<00:05:10.900> one<00:05:11.199> or<00:05:11.229> two<00:05:11.680> causes<00:05:12.840> but<00:05:13.840> this<00:05:14.199> is

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
based on one or two causes but this is

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.920 
based on one or two causes but this is
homeopathy<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:16.030> holistic<00:05:16.660> way<00:05:16.810> of

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
homeopathy and this and holistic way of

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.250 
homeopathy and this and holistic way of
thinking<00:05:17.380> you're<00:05:17.979> not<00:05:18.190> even<00:05:19.060> trying<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.780> find

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
thinking you're not even trying to find

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.500 
thinking you're not even trying to find
the<00:05:20.410> cause<00:05:20.620> but<00:05:21.130> we<00:05:21.310> find<00:05:21.639> try<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.180> find

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
the cause but we find try to find

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.670 
the cause but we find try to find
solutions<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:24.160> that's<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.669> other<00:05:24.820> aspect<00:05:25.419> of

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
solutions so that's the other aspect of

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.830 
solutions so that's the other aspect of
holistic<00:05:26.820> thinking<00:05:27.820> which<00:05:28.180> was<00:05:28.389> always

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
holistic thinking which was always

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.610 
holistic thinking which was always
around

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
around

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.290 
around
and<00:05:31.479> which<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.780> now<00:05:33.350> introduce<00:05:33.710> into<00:05:34.310> into<00:05:35.030> our

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
and which I now introduce into into our

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.680 
and which I now introduce into into our
our<00:05:35.660> system<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:37.040> look<00:05:37.220> for<00:05:37.460> solutions<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:38.330> to

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
our system to look for solutions is to

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.640 
our system to look for solutions is to
basically<00:05:40.090> describe<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.419> person<00:05:41.660> situation

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
basically describe the person situation

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.969 
basically describe the person situation
in<00:05:43.090> in<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.240> most<00:05:44.479> holistic<00:05:45.080> way<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:45.620> what<00:05:45.800> does

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
in in the most holistic way so what does

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.830 
in in the most holistic way so what does
this<00:05:46.100> mean<00:05:46.340> it<00:05:47.120> means<00:05:47.180> not<00:05:48.139> only<00:05:48.380> his<00:05:49.840> the

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
this mean it means not only his the

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.260 
this mean it means not only his the
biochemicals<00:05:51.650> in<00:05:51.889> his<00:05:52.100> body<00:05:52.400> this<00:05:52.970> is<00:05:53.120> what

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
biochemicals in his body this is what

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.020 
biochemicals in his body this is what
modern<00:05:53.840> medicine<00:05:54.350> elaborately<00:05:54.919> looks<00:05:55.550> at<00:05:55.760> at

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
modern medicine elaborately looks at at

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.050 
modern medicine elaborately looks at at
this<00:05:56.270> one<00:05:56.510> point<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:57.770> do<00:05:57.949> a<00:05:57.979> lot<00:05:58.160> analysis

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
this one point and you do a lot analysis

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.680 
this one point and you do a lot analysis
you<00:05:59.210> look<00:05:59.389> at<00:05:59.770> how<00:06:00.770> early<00:06:01.300> neuropeptides<00:06:02.300> how

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
you look at how early neuropeptides how

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.260 
you look at how early neuropeptides how
are<00:06:02.930> they<00:06:03.789> the<00:06:04.789> hormones<00:06:05.539> Howard<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:07.270> maybe

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
are they the hormones Howard the maybe

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.110 
are they the hormones Howard the maybe
the<00:06:08.539> pH<00:06:08.900> level<00:06:08.930> empty<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:10.100> so<00:06:10.310> on<00:06:10.430> how<00:06:10.850> are<00:06:11.000> the

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
the pH level empty and so on how are the

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.540 
the pH level empty and so on how are the
bio<00:06:11.330> chemicals<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:13.539> from<00:06:14.539> this<00:06:14.979> we've<00:06:15.979> tried

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
bio chemicals and from this we've tried

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.290 
bio chemicals and from this we've tried
to<00:06:16.729> diagnose<00:06:17.270> we<00:06:17.630> try<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:18.669> find<00:06:19.669> a<00:06:19.760> reason<00:06:20.150> why

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
to diagnose we try to find a reason why

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.770 
to diagnose we try to find a reason why
somebody<00:06:20.600> is<00:06:21.080> the<00:06:21.260> way<00:06:21.410> he<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:22.030> but<00:06:23.030> this<00:06:23.570> is<00:06:23.750> a

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
somebody is the way he is but this is a

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.530 
somebody is the way he is but this is a
very<00:06:24.080> limited<00:06:24.650> way<00:06:25.130> again<00:06:25.490> and<00:06:25.840> it's<00:06:26.840> based<00:06:27.260> on
