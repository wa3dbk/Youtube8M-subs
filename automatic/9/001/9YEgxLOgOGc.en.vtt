off-putting<00:00:19.190> feedback<00:00:19.580> as<00:00:19.790> far<00:00:19.970> as<00:00:20.060> things

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
off-putting feedback as far as things

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.290 
off-putting feedback as far as things
you<00:00:20.330> like<00:00:20.480> or<00:00:20.630> don't<00:00:20.750> like<00:00:20.869> or<00:00:21.260> teams<00:00:21.860> are<00:00:22.100> good

you like or don't like or teams are good

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.060 
you like or don't like or teams are good
teams<00:00:23.300> are<00:00:23.480> fun<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:23.930> I<00:00:23.990> think

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.310 

I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> man<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.480> quality

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I think the man of quality

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
I think the man of quality
introduces<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.349> tactical<00:00:32.920> building

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.590 

I'd<00:00:40.110> seem<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> wrap<00:00:40.590> around<00:00:40.800> school

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
I'd seem to wrap around school

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.300 
I'd seem to wrap around school
it's<00:00:43.600> also<00:00:43.810> a<00:00:43.930> pretty<00:00:44.200> easy<00:00:44.560> game<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.920> get<00:00:45.280> the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
it's also a pretty easy game to get the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.330 
it's also a pretty easy game to get the
because<00:00:46.090> I<00:00:46.420> know<00:00:47.170> nothing<00:00:47.710> about<00:00:47.800> magic<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
because I know nothing about magic the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.030 
because I know nothing about magic the

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.740 
because it removes a little bit of the
determinism<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.620> removes<00:02:33.890> add<00:02:34.400> some<00:02:34.849> chance

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
determinism it removes add some chance

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.319 
determinism it removes add some chance
to<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.079> game<00:02:36.400> maybe<00:02:37.400> because<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.819> starts<00:02:38.150> off

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
to the game maybe because it starts off

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.050 
to the game maybe because it starts off
with<00:02:38.540> fewer<00:02:39.200> pieces<00:02:39.439> so<00:02:39.829> it's<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.159> but<00:02:40.909> also

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
with fewer pieces so it's like but also

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.089 
with fewer pieces so it's like but also
that<00:02:41.359> there's<00:02:42.049> constant<00:02:42.560> action<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:42.950> not<00:02:43.069> a

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
that there's constant action it's not a

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.849 
that there's constant action it's not a
long<00:02:43.370> game<00:02:43.790> set<00:02:44.120> up<00:02:44.269> right<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.109> just<00:02:45.290> action

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
long game set up right it is just action
