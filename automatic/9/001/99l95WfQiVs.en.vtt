00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi girls today you like rediscovery 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 of the summer that are of the few series 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.510
 but good because they are few products though 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 really in my opinion very much what 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.370
 of by the other known now that there are 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 two products of snow cosmetics is worth a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
 product that I always discover every 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.400
 summer at the palette of to face budo rais 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 that I had bought some time ago and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.910
 I don't know why I always refer to it in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.269
 this period mainly in 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.609
 spring summer which is truly one 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.740
 palette in my opinion is fantastic 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.530
 especially if you love colors anyway 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.500
 new de naturale but not not the usual ones not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.079
 the classics say so this is the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 I've already shown you the pallet 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 many times it seems to me I have done 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.219
 even some sort of asi had done the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.199
 trick conquered in bed in the video 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.559
 of the morning routine and the summer of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.359

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.670
 we say that the duration is not excellent because 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.920
 it lasts about 45 hours not really that much 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.739
 we say that more or less the pluses of snow 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.079
 who more or less last me 4 5 hours here 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.829
 there are some that last a little longer 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.940
 others a little less here than the 245 hours though 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.950
 color 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.780
 and truly wonderful last 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.090
 rediscovery of summer is water 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.280
 scented and is that of erbolario that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.560

 to sniff do it a little bit because it is 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.170

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.170
