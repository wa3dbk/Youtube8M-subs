be<00:01:25.890> writing<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.390> writing<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> little

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
be writing so with writing it's a little

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
be writing so with writing it's a little
bit<00:01:28.110> different<00:01:28.470> because<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.799> selling

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
bit different because you're not selling

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
bit different because you're not selling
a<00:01:29.250> product<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:29.909> doing<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> you're

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
