happier then
then<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.000> might<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:15.690> able<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.170> add<00:02:16.380> back

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
then you might be they able to add back

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.980 
then you might be they able to add back
some<00:02:17.190> white<00:02:17.430> carbohydrates<00:02:18.270> back<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.870> your

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
some white carbohydrates back to your

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.340 
some white carbohydrates back to your
plate<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.860> how<00:02:20.160> much<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.670> small<00:02:21.569> amount<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
plate and how much a small amount a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.760 
plate and how much a small amount a
sliver<00:02:23.030> because<00:02:24.030> any<00:02:24.569> white<00:02:24.959> carbohydrate<00:02:25.740> to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
sliver because any white carbohydrate to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.430 
sliver because any white carbohydrate to
add<00:02:26.130> your<00:02:26.370> plate<00:02:26.610> will<00:02:27.060> increase<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.140> levels

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
add your plate will increase the levels

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.300 
add your plate will increase the levels
of<00:02:28.560> insulin<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.370> will<00:02:30.209> make<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.480> fatter

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
of insulin and that will make you fatter

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.030 
of insulin and that will make you fatter
it'll<00:02:32.310> make<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.610> sicker<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.810> will<00:02:34.709> make<00:02:34.890> you

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it'll make you sicker and will make you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.210 
it'll make you sicker and will make you
more<00:02:35.310> unhappy<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.500> feel<00:02:37.739> lucky

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
more unhappy so if you feel lucky

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.449 
more unhappy so if you feel lucky
genetically<00:02:38.870> then<00:02:39.870> go<00:02:40.110> ahead<00:02:40.410> add<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> small

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
genetically then go ahead add a small

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.870 
genetically then go ahead add a small

zone diets about and that's why I tell

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.710 
zone diets about and that's why I tell
people<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.769> Zone<00:02:55.980> diet<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.790> evolution

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
people the Zone diet is the evolution

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.020 
people the Zone diet is the evolution
the<00:02:58.170> evolution<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.489> Mediterranean<00:03:00.000> diet

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the evolution of the Mediterranean diet

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.440 
the evolution of the Mediterranean diet
is<00:03:00.360> taking<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.050> good<00:03:01.319> diet<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.010> make<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.150> into<00:03:03.420> a

they<00:03:23.040> are<00:03:23.100> invariant<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.870> more<00:03:25.110> we

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
they are invariant and the more we

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.319 
they are invariant and the more we
follow<00:03:25.560> those<00:03:25.769> basic<00:03:26.160> principles<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:27.060> more

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
follow those basic principles the more

follow those basic principles the more
we<00:03:27.540> retake<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.260> 12<00:03:28.470> our<00:03:28.650> future<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.400> make<00:03:29.549> us

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
we retake and 12 our future to make us

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.860 
we retake and 12 our future to make us
thinner<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:31.410> make<00:03:31.620> us<00:03:31.769> healthier<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:33.720> make

basically I have changed my opinion

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.630 
basically I have changed my opinion
about<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.910> zone<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.660> complete<00:03:40.640> fabrication

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
about the zone is complete fabrication

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.329 
about the zone is complete fabrication
