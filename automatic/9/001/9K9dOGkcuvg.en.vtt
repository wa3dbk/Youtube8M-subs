check your final drive fluid we've got a
Komatsu<00:00:07.770> PC<00:00:08.280> 200<00:00:08.849> L<00:00:09.080> c6<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.769> we're<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.040> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
Komatsu PC 200 L c6 that we're going to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.450 
Komatsu PC 200 L c6 that we're going to
be<00:00:11.219> working<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.920> what<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.309> do

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
be working on and what we want to do

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.540 
be working on and what we want to do
first<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.440> we<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.830> make<00:00:16.980> sure<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
first is we have to make sure that the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.000 
first is we have to make sure that the
machine<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.880> level<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.539> if<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> come<00:00:19.830> down<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
machine is level and if you come down to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.060 
machine is level and if you come down to
the<00:00:20.250> final<00:00:20.640> drive<00:00:20.850> section<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.170> would

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the final drive section here you would

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.150 
the final drive section here you would
be<00:00:23.100> at<00:00:23.519> 3<00:00:24.210> o'clock<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.320> oil<00:00:25.350> level<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
be at 3 o'clock with your oil level and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.250 
be at 3 o'clock with your oil level and
then<00:00:26.910> your<00:00:27.090> drain<00:00:27.420> plug<00:00:27.599> would<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.019> down<00:00:28.230> right

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
then your drain plug would be down right

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.519 
then your drain plug would be down right
about<00:00:28.740> 6<00:00:29.160> o'clock<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:31.019> incorrect

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
about 6 o'clock so if that's incorrect

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.120 
about 6 o'clock so if that's incorrect
location<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.890> take<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
location what we can do is you take a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.270 
location what we can do is you take a
hammer<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.530> tap<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.100> those

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
hammer and you want to just tap on those

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.080 
hammer and you want to just tap on those
pretty<00:00:38.610> good<00:00:43.070> what<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.910> kind

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
pretty good what it will do is just kind

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
pretty good what it will do is just kind
of<00:00:45.149> loosen<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.289> little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> threads

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
of loosen up a little bit of the threads

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.729 
of loosen up a little bit of the threads
because<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.879> under<00:00:48.149> pressure

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
because they are under pressure

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.779 
because they are under pressure
also<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> make<00:00:50.190> sure<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
also you want to make sure that you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.569 
also you want to make sure that you
clean<00:00:51.180> around<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.230> areas<00:00:52.440> real<00:00:52.920> good<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
clean around these areas real good you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
clean around these areas real good you
don't<00:00:53.699> want<00:00:53.789> any<00:00:54.030> dirt<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.449> debris<00:00:54.510> getting

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
don't want any dirt or debris getting

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.970 
don't want any dirt or debris getting
put<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> fluid<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> once<00:00:58.410> we've<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.649> all

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
put into the fluid so once we've got all

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
put into the fluid so once we've got all
that<00:00:59.129> cleaned<00:00:59.460> off<00:00:59.579> which<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.210> done

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that cleaned off which I have done

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.720 
that cleaned off which I have done
beforehand<00:01:01.050> we've<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> half<00:01:02.250> inch<00:01:02.430> drive

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
beforehand we've got a half inch drive

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:12.530 
beforehand we've got a half inch drive
ratchet<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:07.290> put<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.390> got

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
ratchet just put it in there and you got

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.300 
ratchet just put it in there and you got
to<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.780> careful<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.500> bit<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:13.979> like

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to be careful a little bit because like

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.800 
to be careful a little bit because like
I<00:01:14.430> said<00:01:14.490> before<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.240> under<00:01:15.570> pressure

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I said before these are under pressure

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960 
I said before these are under pressure
so<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.890> take<00:01:17.070> them<00:01:17.220> off<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.759> bit

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
so you just take them off a little bit

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.410 
so you just take them off a little bit
slow<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> pressure

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
slow and if there's a lot of pressure

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
slow and if there's a lot of pressure
built<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.930> you'll<00:01:22.140> hear<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> pressure<00:01:22.650> being

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
built up you'll hear the pressure being

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.789 
built up you'll hear the pressure being
released<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.049> seems<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.590> pretty

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
released out this one seems to be pretty

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
released out this one seems to be pretty
good<00:01:27.860> what<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.060> got<00:01:30.090> some

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
good what there we go we got some

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.789 
good what there we go we got some
pressure

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.740 

we<00:01:39.250> want<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.490> release<00:01:39.610> all<00:01:39.939> that<00:01:39.970> pressure<00:01:40.390> we

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
we want to release all that pressure we

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.030 
we want to release all that pressure we
don't<00:01:40.899> want<00:01:41.049> anybody<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.409> get<00:01:41.590> injured<00:01:41.860> while

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
don't want anybody to get injured while

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.770 
don't want anybody to get injured while
they're<00:01:42.250> doing<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.450> what<00:01:43.630> we're

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
they're doing this and what we're

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.840 
they're doing this and what we're
looking<00:01:44.079> for<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.590> we're<00:01:45.250> just<00:01:45.280> checking<00:01:45.759> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
looking for is we're just checking the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.340 
looking for is we're just checking the
level<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.329> this<00:01:46.479> one<00:01:46.720> we<00:01:46.869> want<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.140> make<00:01:47.200> sure

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
level on this one we want to make sure

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.749 
level on this one we want to make sure
that<00:01:47.680> there's<00:01:47.860> just<00:01:48.040> going<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.310> be<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> little

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
that there's just going to be a little

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.210 
that there's just going to be a little
bit<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.000> fluid<00:01:49.299> running<00:01:49.509> out<00:01:49.830> if<00:01:50.830> there's<00:01:51.130> a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
bit of fluid running out if there's a

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.370 
bit of fluid running out if there's a
lot<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.700> fluid<00:01:51.880> then<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.539> could<00:01:52.689> be<00:01:52.810> overfilled

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
lot of fluid then it could be overfilled

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.510 
lot of fluid then it could be overfilled
which<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.890> not<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.070> good<00:01:54.310> thing<00:01:54.490> either

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
which is not a good thing either

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.660 
which is not a good thing either
we<00:01:57.520> released<00:01:57.909> all<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.570> pressure<00:01:58.960> here<00:01:59.670> we've

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
we released all the pressure here we've

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.340 
we released all the pressure here we've
got<00:02:00.880> just<00:02:01.179> a<00:02:01.299> little<00:02:01.330> bit<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.840> fluid<00:02:02.020> coming

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
got just a little bit of fluid coming

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.330 
got just a little bit of fluid coming
out<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.179> machine<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.960> up<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.920> correct

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
out so this machine is up to correct

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.759 
out so this machine is up to correct
levels<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.899> we<00:02:07.929> don't<00:02:08.229> have<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.530> worry<00:02:08.709> about

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
levels so we don't have to worry about

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.400 
levels so we don't have to worry about
final<00:02:09.340> drive<00:02:09.550> failure

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:26.070 

just<00:02:14.410> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> tighten<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.900> of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
just going to tighten this up and of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.810 
just going to tighten this up and of
course<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.440> would<00:02:26.560> go<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.400> other<00:02:27.550> side

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
course you would go to the other side

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.560 
course you would go to the other side
and<00:02:28.030> check<00:02:28.210> it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
and check it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.560 
and check it
well<00:02:29.500> what<00:02:29.950> Komatsu<00:02:30.400> recommends<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.210> about

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
well what Komatsu recommends is about

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.660 
well what Komatsu recommends is about
every<00:02:31.960> two<00:02:32.200> thousand<00:02:32.770> hours<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.250> change<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
every two thousand hours to change the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.290 
every two thousand hours to change the
fluid<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.180> your<00:02:34.870> final<00:02:35.110> drive<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.090> good

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
fluid and your final drive it's a good

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.910 
fluid and your final drive it's a good
thing<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.600> check<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.960> probably<00:02:38.440> about<00:02:38.560> every

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
thing to check it probably about every

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.830 
thing to check it probably about every
time<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> change<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.820> oil<00:02:39.850> which<00:02:40.570> would<00:02:40.720> be

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
time you change the oil which would be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.040 
time you change the oil which would be
about<00:02:41.050> 250<00:02:41.890> hours<00:02:41.920> which<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.610> recommended<00:02:43.050> I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
about 250 hours which is recommended I

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.260 
about 250 hours which is recommended I

kind of quit parts we do sell a lot of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.330 
kind of quit parts we do sell a lot of
final<00:02:46.600> drives<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.380> people<00:02:47.740> fail<00:02:48.070> to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
final drives because people fail to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.250 
final drives because people fail to
check<00:02:48.910> their<00:02:49.090> fluid<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.110> number

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
check their fluid and that is the number

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.220 
check their fluid and that is the number
one<00:02:50.560> reason<00:02:50.950> why<00:02:50.980> final<00:02:51.520> drives<00:02:51.760> fail<00:02:52.230> so

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
one reason why final drives fail so

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.660 
one reason why final drives fail so
that's<00:02:53.410> why<00:02:53.500> we<00:02:53.650> wanted<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.310> video<00:02:54.460> to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
that's why we wanted to do this video to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.510 
that's why we wanted to do this video to
show<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.030> how<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.810> correctly<00:02:56.260> check<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.250> as

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
show you how to correctly check and as

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.510 
show you how to correctly check and as
you<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.760> tell<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.270> very<00:02:58.360> simple<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.050> do<00:02:59.520> but

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
you can tell it's very simple to do but

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.250 
you can tell it's very simple to do but
if<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:01.150> some<00:03:01.180> reason<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.720> guys<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.050> need<00:03:02.200> a
