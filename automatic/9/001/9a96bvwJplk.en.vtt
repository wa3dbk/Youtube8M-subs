00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.800 
chapter 3 here freaking spawn you in the
middle<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.199> saber-toothed<00:00:16.830> tiger<00:00:17.460> den<00:00:17.810> or

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
middle of a saber-toothed tiger den or

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.870 
middle of a saber-toothed tiger den or
maybe<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.230> tiger<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> cat<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.340> prefer

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
maybe not tiger but the cat I prefer

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.779 
maybe not tiger but the cat I prefer
tiger<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.859> sounds<00:00:23.250> cool<00:00:23.279> but

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
tiger just because it sounds cool but

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580 
tiger just because it sounds cool but
they're<00:00:24.510> not<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:24.810> Tigers<00:00:25.289> since<00:00:25.500> they

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
they're not really Tigers since they

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.460 
they're not really Tigers since they
don't<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.769> stripes<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.310> anything<00:00:27.470> anyway

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
don't have stripes or anything anyway

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.650 
don't have stripes or anything anyway
your<00:00:29.429> shotgun<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> probably<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> be

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
your shotgun is probably going to be

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
your shotgun is probably going to be
your<00:00:30.929> best<00:00:31.109> weapon<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.219> just

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
your best weapon for it here just

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.549 
your best weapon for it here just
because<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.270> cover<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.899> quite<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
because they do cover up quite a bit of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
because they do cover up quite a bit of
space<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> shotgun<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.600> can

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
space and with the shotgun you can

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
space and with the shotgun you can
really<00:00:37.020> cover<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> wide<00:00:37.950> area<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.670> front<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
really cover a wide area in front of you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.920 
really cover a wide area in front of you
and<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:41.160> shotgun<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.760> fire<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.390> quickly

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and the shotgun can fire really quickly

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
and the shotgun can fire really quickly
which<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> also<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.640> when

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
which is also really good because when

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.020 
which is also really good because when
you<00:00:44.969> shoot<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.450> guys<00:00:45.890> they<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> fly<00:00:47.640> back

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you shoot these guys they like fly back

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
you shoot these guys they like fly back
a<00:00:48.059> little<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.590> fly<00:00:49.950> back

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a little bit or they don't like fly back

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
a little bit or they don't like fly back
they<00:00:50.489> certainly<00:00:50.850> move<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:53.870> what

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
they certainly move back then so what

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.160 
they certainly move back then so what
was<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.289> about

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
was that all about

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.450 
was that all about
the<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.320> other<00:00:58.559> weapon<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the only other weapon I can think of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.920 
the only other weapon I can think of
that<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.789> better<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.420> kill<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.750> guys

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that would be better to kill these guys

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
that would be better to kill these guys
would<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> pistol<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
would be actually the pistol because you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
would be actually the pistol because you
know<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.480> fire<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.989> quickly<00:01:04.500> compared

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
know your fire really quickly compared

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
know your fire really quickly compared
to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> shotgun<00:01:05.510> but<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.229> weaker<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to the shotgun but it also be weaker and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.109 
to the shotgun but it also be weaker and
it<00:01:07.830> would<00:01:07.920> take<00:01:08.070> longer<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> shotguns

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it would take longer so the shotguns

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.359 
it would take longer so the shotguns
still<00:01:09.390> probably<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.840> best<00:01:09.990> bet<00:01:10.220> here's<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
still probably your best bet here's the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.170 
still probably your best bet here's the
really<00:01:11.640> big<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.360> jeez<00:01:14.869> he's<00:01:15.869> got<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.409> more

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
really big one jeez he's got two more

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.410 
really big one jeez he's got two more
there's<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:19.670> just<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.759> ahead<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.000> kill<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
there's one just go ahead and kill the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.890 
there's one just go ahead and kill the
others

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
others

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050 
others
right<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
right here and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.539 
right here and
you'll<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.140> much<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.530> you'll<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.159> out

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you'll be pretty much out you'll be out

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
you'll be pretty much out you'll be out
of<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.850> okay<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.320> exit

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
of the okay see right there is your exit

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
of the okay see right there is your exit

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
launcher in the last video or the last

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
launcher in the last video or the last
area<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> didn't<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> risk<00:01:34.020> your

life trying to get it you can get

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179 
life trying to get it you can get
another<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.680> now<00:01:37.680> since

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
another one right there now since

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.289 
another one right there now since

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
now because you know I didn't really get

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.870 
now because you know I didn't really get
a<00:01:48.630> chance<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.289> last<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> like

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a chance to the last time this is like

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
a chance to the last time this is like
the<00:01:51.060> most<00:01:51.240> destructive<00:01:51.750> rocket<00:01:52.350> launcher

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the most destructive rocket launcher

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
the most destructive rocket launcher
I've<00:01:52.799> ever<00:01:53.070> seen<00:01:53.429> in<00:01:53.729> any<00:01:53.909> shooter<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:55.110> screw

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
I've ever seen in any shooter like screw

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.559 
I've ever seen in any shooter like screw
the<00:01:55.920> halo<00:01:56.340> Rock<00:01:56.580> launcher<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.299> this

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
the halo Rock launcher because this

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.260 
the halo Rock launcher because this
thing<00:01:57.869> fires<00:01:58.470> one<00:01:58.799> big<00:01:59.220> rocket<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.090> also

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
thing fires one big rocket and it also

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.580 
thing fires one big rocket and it also
fires<00:02:00.690> two<00:02:01.759> three<00:02:02.759> four<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.780> rockets<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
fires two three four little rockets that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.639 
fires two three four little rockets that
also<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> same<00:02:05.850> direction<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.470> if

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
also go like in the same direction so if

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.289 
also go like in the same direction so if
you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.920> aim<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.549> right<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.819> being

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
you can aim it just right like being

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.089 
you can aim it just right like being
aiming<00:02:09.630> at<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> large<00:02:10.049> group<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.530> enemies<00:02:10.860> you

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
aiming at a large group of enemies you

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.670 
aiming at a large group of enemies you
can<00:02:11.430> probably<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.569> five<00:02:13.019> or<00:02:13.170> six<00:02:13.200> kills

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
can probably get like five or six kills

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.199 
can probably get like five or six kills
with<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.340> rocket<00:02:14.849> or<00:02:15.180> even<00:02:15.690> maybe<00:02:16.319> more

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
with just one rocket or even maybe more

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.550 
with just one rocket or even maybe more
because<00:02:18.209> you're<00:02:18.480> dealing<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.349> much

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
because you're dealing with so much

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.100 
because you're dealing with so much
Splash<00:02:19.980> Damage<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:21.360> anyway<00:02:21.660> let's<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:21.959> back

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
Splash Damage but anyway let's get back

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.809 
Splash Damage but anyway let's get back
to<00:02:22.230> using<00:02:22.470> our<00:02:22.620> trusty<00:02:23.010> shotgun<00:02:23.519> here<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
to using our trusty shotgun here and

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.220 
to using our trusty shotgun here and
let's<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.030> keep<00:02:27.239> on<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.930> down<00:02:28.049> these

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
let's just keep on going down these

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.500 
let's just keep on going down these
cliffs<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.660> yeah<00:02:31.250> anyway<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.549> think<00:02:33.359> it'd<00:02:33.480> be

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
cliffs so yeah anyway I think it'd be

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.030 
cliffs so yeah anyway I think it'd be
kind<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.870> cool<00:02:34.019> if<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.260> levels<00:02:34.590> were<00:02:34.680> actually

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
kind of cool if the levels were actually

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.430 
kind of cool if the levels were actually
reversed<00:02:35.579> but<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.390> destination<00:02:37.049> was<00:02:37.230> still

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
reversed but the destination was still

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.620 
reversed but the destination was still
the<00:02:37.590> same<00:02:37.799> like<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.190> come<00:02:38.489> up<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.880> way<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
the same like you come up this way and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.970 
the same like you come up this way and
you<00:02:39.720> go<00:02:39.870> through<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.170> saber-tooth<00:02:40.590> Tiger

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
you go through the saber-tooth Tiger

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.370 
you go through the saber-tooth Tiger
then<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:42.000> end<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.420> last<00:02:42.630> at<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.230> end

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
then and the end of the last at the end

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.830 
then and the end of the last at the end
of<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.980> second<00:02:44.609> part<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.000> chapter<00:02:45.299> you

of that second part of this chapter you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.539 
of that second part of this chapter you
fight<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.260> t-rex<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.130> sort<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.430> be

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
fight the t-rex and that it sort of be

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.280 
fight the t-rex and that it sort of be
like<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> mini<00:02:48.120> boss<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.690> would<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.810> cool

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
like a mini boss that would be cool

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.670 
back the gun but this gun is really kind
of<00:04:26.340> fun<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.790> use<00:04:26.970> because<00:04:27.540> you're<00:04:27.870> totally

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
of fun to use because you're totally

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560 
of fun to use because you're totally
safe<00:04:29.310> while<00:04:29.700> you're<00:04:29.790> doing<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.210> no<00:04:30.390> matter

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
safe while you're doing this no matter

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.810 
safe while you're doing this no matter
what<00:04:30.780> side<00:04:31.050> they're<00:04:31.200> coming<00:04:31.730> you're<00:04:32.730> almost

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
what side they're coming you're almost

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.680 
what side they're coming you're almost
safe<00:04:33.600> no<00:04:33.840> matter<00:04:33.990> what<00:04:34.700> because<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:36.210> gun<00:04:36.450> is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
safe no matter what because the gun is

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.200 
safe no matter what because the gun is
so<00:04:36.900> big<00:04:37.200> that<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:39.360> almost<00:04:39.570> acts<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.169> a<00:04:40.290> shield

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
so big that it almost acts like a shield

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.610 
so big that it almost acts like a shield
so<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.240> even<00:04:42.780> though<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.200> they<00:04:43.410> could<00:04:43.590> be

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
so that even though like they could be

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.440 
so that even though like they could be
shooting<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.460> right<00:04:44.700> in<00:04:44.850> front<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.270> and

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
shooting like right in front of you and

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.210 
shooting like right in front of you and
they<00:04:45.600> make<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.990> in<00:04:46.140> between<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.500> gun<00:04:46.800> barrels

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
they make it in between the gun barrels

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.100 
they make it in between the gun barrels
but<00:04:47.400> it's<00:04:47.550> still<00:04:47.820> stopped<00:04:48.180> by<00:04:48.419> like<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.930> know

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
but it's still stopped by like you know

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.750 
but it's still stopped by like you know
the<00:04:49.680> guns<00:04:49.890> still<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:50.430> like<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.640> hit

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
the guns still it's like the hit

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.640 
the guns still it's like the hit
detection<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:51.360> weird<00:04:51.600> on<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.930> gun<00:04:52.110> itself

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
detection is weird on the gun itself

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.860 
detection is weird on the gun itself
so<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.700> can<00:04:53.790> act<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.180> shield<00:04:54.510> which<00:04:54.750> is

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
so it can act like a shield which is

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.330 
so it can act like a shield which is
pretty<00:04:55.050> cool<00:04:56.419> anyway<00:04:57.620> just<00:04:58.620> keep<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.100> going

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
pretty cool anyway just keep on going

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.940 
pretty cool anyway just keep on going
through<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.640> area<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.540> then<00:05:01.470> we're<00:05:01.710> near

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
through this area and then we're near

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.380 
through this area and then we're near
the<00:05:01.979> end<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.460> level<00:05:02.700> which<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.180> nice

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
the end of this level which is nice

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.150 
the end of this level which is nice
