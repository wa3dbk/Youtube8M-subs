00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.850
 it works for me too 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.700
 I have further 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.250
 difficult that means I can 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.730
 here on 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.590
 early in the morning my videos ever before 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.600
 turn saying that way I always stand 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.189
 gradually 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 Now I have the following in front of me 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.520
 would like to make the christmas sugar 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.029
 Many recipes also in the recipe world 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.070
 but true 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.190
 i would like to have a christmas calendar 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.190
 speculoos scares love speculation 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.210
 and in starbucks, there are always 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.989
 so grit speculative summit on top 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.510
 I could freak out and would like to 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.660
 I create with you so to speak now 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.399
 we'll look and I need it 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.399
 for 150 sugar 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:26.020
 then I have come here speculation 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:35.440
 now good teaspoon in then I have 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:41.890
 here coriander man of it with the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.640
 share then I forgave him 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.970
 pole 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.890
 I know now 11 10 stood 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.429
 sorry no rubbish to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.360
 thinking human being five cloves pure 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.060
 then times makes six planets careful 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.080
 and wear that that is not so good 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.530
 then I have caravan here just should 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.130
 give a little bit of fresh eyes 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:16.170
 keep the waffle bakery then I have 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.170
 this industry book parcel 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.489
 that that would have it all year too 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.209
 However, we have to let just say 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.810
 look 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.670
 that are his and on 1 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.069
 I'm going to ground but only 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.069
 for the reason it expires soon 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.579
 If I had that, I'll do a good half 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.579
 teaspoon 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.920
 it is also here after two weeks 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.799
 unfolds the full aroma for it 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.700
 nice pull five seconds on stage and 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.659
 finished 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.659
 we'll do that now 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:46.880
 just one more one could of course 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:46.880
 still a bit dusty 1 hammer 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.240
 So it really is pulverized properly 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.190
 But I have to say it's not that 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.169
 right here that speculum tastes good 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.370
 namely the karl amon is right 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.710
 but more may like it will love it 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.290
 I did not want to know what that was 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:51.960
 speculation tastes that I give now 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:51.960
 again in the meantime 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.949
 I made myself nice coffee 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.240
 could that be nice for his top 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:12.310
 maybe not flexible 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:19.840
 practical and easy to listen to 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:22.710
 I would have to taste that immediately 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.710
 problem with the coffee 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.960
 it's like the santa claus 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:38.330
 it's already at the door 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:40.490
 thanks for yours most of all, you 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.020
 You can still speculate 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.759
 So if that's what you need to do now 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.650
 now it's a little bit and you just enter 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.669
 a little bit more pure 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.169
 it's totally simple recipe is 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.759
 Just do everything Christmas 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.860
 somehow have available and pops 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.449
 Add it to the sugar and pulverize it 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.669
 and then you have such a delicious one 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.169
 drink that I want right now because that 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.880
 also in my christmas cartons 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.580
 christmas boxes so all comes 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.870
 send and I think or I am 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.830
 I'm sure the people are happy 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.830
 bye bye
