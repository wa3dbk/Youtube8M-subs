photography in photography TTL is known

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.149 
photography in photography TTL is known
as<00:00:20.640> through<00:00:21.269> the<00:00:21.539> lens

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:22.159 
as through the lens

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.529 
as through the lens
it's<00:00:23.159> simply<00:00:23.429> just<00:00:23.489> an<00:00:23.789> automated<00:00:24.210> process

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
it's simply just an automated process

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.380 
it's simply just an automated process
first<00:00:25.169> your<00:00:25.409> camera<00:00:25.800> does<00:00:26.039> use<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.609> order<00:00:27.149> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
first your camera does use in order to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.899 
first your camera does use in order to
determine<00:00:27.890> what<00:00:28.890> should<00:00:29.159> be<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.550> correct

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
determine what should be the correct

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.749 
determine what should be the correct
flash<00:00:30.599> output<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.499> your<00:00:31.769> TTL<00:00:32.489> compatible

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
flash output of your TTL compatible

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.470 
flash output of your TTL compatible
flashes<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> hold<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> TTL<00:00:36.180> work<00:00:36.830> TTL<00:00:37.830> works

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
flashes so hold of TTL work TTL works

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.320 
flashes so hold of TTL work TTL works
simply<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> pre-flight<00:00:40.490> what<00:00:41.490> happens<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
simply by a pre-flight what happens is

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.710 
simply by a pre-flight what happens is
that<00:00:42.810> this<00:00:43.020> plea<00:00:43.380> flash<00:00:44.030> comes<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
that this plea flash comes out of the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.690 
that this plea flash comes out of the
flight<00:00:45.900> before<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.010> camera<00:00:47.340> ticks<00:00:47.580> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
flight before you camera ticks the

flight before you camera ticks the
photograph<00:00:48.150> it<00:00:48.450> will<00:00:48.990> then<00:00:49.230> hit<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.980> subject

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
photograph it will then hit your subject

and<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.270> reflected<00:00:51.870> light<00:00:52.080> will<00:00:52.470> bounce<00:00:52.680> back

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and the reflected light will bounce back

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.730 
and the reflected light will bounce back
into<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.580> camera's<00:00:54.060> lens<00:00:54.560> once<00:00:55.560> the

photograph TTL can be thought of as a

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.569 
photograph TTL can be thought of as a
plug-and-play<00:01:33.149> system<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.799> literally<00:01:35.130> plug

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
plug-and-play system you literally plug

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.639 
plug-and-play system you literally plug
in<00:01:35.789> your<00:01:35.909> Flash<00:01:36.149> press<00:01:36.959> the<00:01:37.139> button<00:01:37.499> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
in your Flash press the button the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.999 
in your Flash press the button the
camera<00:01:37.829> flash<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.389> hard<00:01:39.600> work

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
camera flash they do the hard work

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.699 
camera flash they do the hard work
however<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.729> were<00:01:41.819> to<00:01:41.880> work<00:01:42.209> with<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.899> TTL

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
however if you were to work with a TTL

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.639 
however if you were to work with a TTL
then<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.459> will<00:01:44.579> find<00:01:44.999> that<00:01:45.600> working<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.529> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
then you will find that working with the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.059 
then you will find that working with the
manual<00:01:47.039> flash<00:01:47.279> and<00:01:47.670> work<00:01:47.999> an<00:01:48.209> idea<00:01:49.069> exposures

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
manual flash and work an idea exposures

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.899 
manual flash and work an idea exposures
is<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:51.209> lot<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.990> time-consuming<00:01:52.670> which<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
is a lot more time-consuming which is

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.969 
is a lot more time-consuming which is
why<00:01:54.499> TTL<00:01:55.499> is<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.979> popular<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:57.119> photographers

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
why TTL is so popular with photographers

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
why TTL is so popular with photographers
for<00:01:58.979> example<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.759> look<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> words<00:02:00.329> in

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
for example have a look at the words in

the photographer the wedding
photographer<00:02:02.219> does<00:02:02.849> not<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.359> the<00:02:03.630> time<00:02:03.899> in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
photographer does not have the time in

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.760 
photographer does not have the time in

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
order to be working light what a manual

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.639 
order to be working light what a manual
flash<00:02:08.069> exposure<00:02:08.550> should<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.270> instead<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
flash exposure should be instead the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.770 
flash exposure should be instead the
wedding<00:02:11.009> photographer<00:02:11.580> will<00:02:11.910> fear<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.660> a
