wrong I don't mind the round base
domination<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.000> okay<00:00:31.189> but<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.570> just

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
domination I think it's okay but I just

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.430 
domination I think it's okay but I just
some<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> triarchs<00:00:35.969> domination<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> hot

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
some of the triarchs domination is a hot

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
some of the triarchs domination is a hot
a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:37.950> harder<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.460> play<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> Infinity

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
a lot harder to play then the Infinity

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.760 
a lot harder to play then the Infinity
Ward<00:00:39.840> 1<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> even<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.950> black<00:00:41.219> ops<00:00:42.410> I'd<00:00:43.410> say<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
Ward 1 and even in black ops I'd say it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.080 
Ward 1 and even in black ops I'd say it
was<00:00:43.920> even<00:00:44.190> easier<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
was even easier there I think this is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
was even easier there I think this is
the<00:00:45.270> hardest<00:00:45.510> domination<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.350> well<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the hardest domination to do well in my

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
the hardest domination to do well in my
opinion<00:00:46.980> i'm<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.520> sure<00:00:47.730> why<00:00:47.910> i<00:00:48.239> think<00:00:48.600> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
opinion i'm not sure why i think it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.260 
opinion i'm not sure why i think it's
cuz<00:00:48.930> betta<00:00:49.170> i'm<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.559> hard<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.920> grab<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> like

it or not no matter how defensively I
play<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.489> probably<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> biggest<00:00:54.120> obj<00:00:54.690> player

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

flag<00:01:01.949> capsule<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.520> domination<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.420> game

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
flag capsule in domination in this game

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.130 
flag capsule in domination in this game
so<00:01:03.809> far<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.680> xbox<00:01:05.010> 360<00:01:05.570> i'm<00:01:06.570> always<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
so far on the xbox 360 i'm always the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
so far on the xbox 360 i'm always the
guy<00:01:07.260> first<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.950> jump<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> flag<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
guy first want to jump on the flag and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.109 
guy first want to jump on the flag and
you<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.270> first<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> play<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> obj<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
you know first one to play the obj so

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
you know first one to play the obj so
that's<00:01:12.119> why<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.420> katie's<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.320> high

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that's why my katie's also not so high

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590 
that's why my katie's also not so high
in<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.710> game<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> fact<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
in this game and also the fact that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
in this game and also the fact that
domination<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.830> kind<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
domination this game is they kind of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
domination this game is they kind of
flip<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.240> pattern<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.720> i'm<00:01:18.900> not

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
flip in a bit of a pattern that i'm not

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
flip in a bit of a pattern that i'm not
used<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> yet<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.729> went<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> played

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
used to yet so we went and played

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
used to yet so we went and played
demolition<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> i<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> say<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
demolition and i would have to say that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.740 
demolition and i would have to say that
this<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> probably<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.150> favorite<00:01:24.180> game<00:01:24.600> mode

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this is probably my favorite game mode

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.149 
this is probably my favorite game mode
is<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.500> similar<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> black

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is right now it's similar to the black

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.880 
is right now it's similar to the black
ops<00:01:26.580> 1<00:01:26.670> domination<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.840> spawns<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.409> change<00:01:28.740> a

ops 1 domination the spawns do change a

ops 1 domination the spawns do change a
little<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> couple

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
little bit they do have a couple

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
little bit they do have a couple
alternates<00:01:30.600> bonds<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> most<00:01:31.920> point

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
alternates bonds but for the most point

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.910 
alternates bonds but for the most point
you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.820> spawn<00:01:33.030> trap<00:01:33.299> them<00:01:33.420> pretty<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
you can spawn trap them pretty well and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.760 
you can spawn trap them pretty well and
I<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> say<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:37.320> makes<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
I would have to say that this makes it a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.730 
I would have to say that this makes it a
lot<00:01:37.890> easier<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.430> myself<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.210> well<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
lot easier for myself to do well and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.749 
lot easier for myself to do well and
this<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:41.610> much<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this right here is pretty much a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
this right here is pretty much a
standard<00:01:42.030> game<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.600> demo<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.189> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
standard game for demo I think this is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
standard game for demo I think this is
like<00:01:44.310> an<00:01:44.460> 1100<00:01:44.909> game<00:01:45.240> definitely<00:01:45.930> nothing

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
like an 1100 game definitely nothing

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
like an 1100 game definitely nothing
special<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.310> sure<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
special that is for sure it is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
special that is for sure it is
definitely<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> high<00:01:48.420> scoring<00:01:48.750> game<00:01:48.810> play

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
definitely not a high scoring game play

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.350 
definitely not a high scoring game play
whatsoever<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.520> only<00:01:50.700> thing<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.030> thought<00:01:51.210> was

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
whatsoever the only thing I thought was

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
whatsoever the only thing I thought was
cool<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> fact<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
cool about it is just the fact that you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
cool about it is just the fact that you
know<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.549> ran<00:01:53.729> over<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.149> kids<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.810> we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
know we ran over these kids you know we

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.539 
know we ran over these kids you know we
didn't<00:01:55.290> let<00:01:55.380> them<00:01:55.500> plant<00:01:55.770> once<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.189> plant<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
didn't let them plant once we plant in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
didn't let them plant once we plant in
both<00:01:56.700> bombs<00:01:56.969> right<00:01:57.240> away<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:58.020> playing<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
both bombs right away we're playing to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
both bombs right away we're playing to
win<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.159> necessarily<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.850> kills<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
win not for necessarily for kills and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.819 
win not for necessarily for kills and
you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.020> pretty<00:02:01.229> much<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.560> how<00:02:01.710> it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you know this is pretty much just how it

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.460 
you know this is pretty much just how it
gets<00:02:01.979> done<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> most<00:02:03.210> part<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
gets done for the most part and

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.490 
gets done for the most part and
I<00:02:05.530> know<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.010> think<00:02:06.340> demolition<00:02:06.910> is<00:02:07.120> probably<00:02:07.630> it

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
I know I think demolition is probably it

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.350 
I know I think demolition is probably it
might<00:02:09.070> just<00:02:09.250> be<00:02:09.430> what<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.610> play<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.180> game

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
might just be what I play in this game

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.030 
might just be what I play in this game
I've<00:02:10.509> never<00:02:10.630> really<00:02:10.899> played<00:02:11.110> demo<00:02:11.380> before<00:02:11.620> but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
I've never really played demo before but

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860 
I've never really played demo before but
it's<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.430> hell<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.850> lot<00:02:12.970> easier<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.360> me<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.630> do

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
it's a hell of a lot easier for me to do

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
it's a hell of a lot easier for me to do
well<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.800> easier<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.310> play<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.580> obj<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.420> my

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
well it's easier to play the obj in my

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.080 
well it's easier to play the obj in my
personal<00:02:16.780> opinion<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.790> once<00:02:19.000> you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
personal opinion and you know once you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.310 
personal opinion and you know once you
get<00:02:19.210> them<00:02:19.330> lock<00:02:19.540> down<00:02:19.570> it's<00:02:19.900> pretty<00:02:20.080> hard<00:02:20.260> for

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
get them lock down it's pretty hard for

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.540 
get them lock down it's pretty hard for
them<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.710> out<00:02:20.770> I'm<00:02:21.070> kind<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.340> using

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
them to get out I'm kind of using

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.340 
them to get out I'm kind of using
women's<00:02:21.790> Redemption<00:02:22.270> spot<00:02:22.600> even<00:02:23.230> though<00:02:23.320> I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
women's Redemption spot even though I

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.260 
women's Redemption spot even though I
guarantee<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.070> probably<00:02:24.400> used<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.760> before<00:02:24.850> him

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
guarantee I probably used it before him

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.270 
guarantee I probably used it before him
he<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.690> made<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.870> famous<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.890> little<00:02:27.070> head

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
he just made it famous this little head

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.710 
he just made it famous this little head
glitch<00:02:27.520> on<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> rocks<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.300> working<00:02:28.690> through

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
glitch on the rocks and working through

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.740 
glitch on the rocks and working through
this<00:02:28.930> little<00:02:29.110> center<00:02:29.500> area<00:02:30.630> everyone's<00:02:31.630> like

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
this little center area everyone's like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.600 
this little center area everyone's like
oh<00:02:31.870> that's<00:02:32.050> wings<00:02:32.230> Redemption<00:02:32.740> spot<00:02:32.980> yeah<00:02:33.250> i'm

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
oh that's wings Redemption spot yeah i'm

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.040 
oh that's wings Redemption spot yeah i'm
sure<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.390> because<00:02:34.540> he<00:02:34.660> made<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> video

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
sure it is just because he made a video

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.260 
sure it is just because he made a video
on<00:02:35.320> them<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:35.890> i<00:02:36.130> guess<00:02:36.700> he<00:02:36.850> takes<00:02:37.060> credit

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
on them you know i guess he takes credit

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.250 
on them you know i guess he takes credit
for<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:38.050> fine<00:02:38.290> um

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
for it but you know that's fine um

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.800 
for it but you know that's fine um
something<00:02:41.260> about<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:42.580> maps<00:02:42.820> on<00:02:43.060> demo<00:02:43.360> 2<00:02:43.420> is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
something about some maps on demo 2 is

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.390 
something about some maps on demo 2 is
that<00:02:44.080> they're<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.530> lot<00:02:44.709> easier<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.100> spawn

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that they're a lot easier to spawn

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.710 
that they're a lot easier to spawn
trapped<00:02:45.730> another's<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.240> was<00:02:46.390> going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> use<00:02:46.690> a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
trapped another's I was going to use a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.449 
trapped another's I was going to use a
hijacking<00:02:47.230> play<00:02:47.590> hijacked<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.130> probably<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
hijacking play hijacked is probably the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.010 
hijacking play hijacked is probably the
easiest<00:02:48.490> map<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.150> spawn<00:02:49.360> trap<00:02:49.600> for<00:02:49.750> demo

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
easiest map of spawn trap for demo

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.960 
easiest map of spawn trap for demo
because<00:02:50.230> they'll<00:02:50.650> continue<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.130> spawn<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.850> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
because they'll continue to spawn in the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.420 
because they'll continue to spawn in the
back<00:02:52.150> behind<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.990> boat<00:02:53.230> either<00:02:53.470> side<00:02:53.830> like

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
back behind the boat either side like

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
back behind the boat either side like
off<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.610> dock<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.890> know<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.400> get<00:02:57.850> 100

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
off the dock so you know you can get 100

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.330 
off the dock so you know you can get 100
kill<00:02:58.720> games<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.230> demo<00:02:59.470> no<00:02:59.770> problem<00:03:00.130> if<00:03:00.250> you

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
kill games in demo no problem if you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.620 
kill games in demo no problem if you
have<00:03:00.430> high<00:03:00.610> streets<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.180> know<00:03:01.300> as<00:03:01.420> long<00:03:01.450> as

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
have high streets you know as long as

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.730 
have high streets you know as long as
you<00:03:01.720> bet<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:02.050> get<00:03:02.260> your<00:03:02.350> streaks<00:03:02.650> going

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
you bet you know get your streaks going

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.590 
you bet you know get your streaks going
because<00:03:03.490> they'll<00:03:03.730> just<00:03:03.850> continue<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.330> spawn

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
because they'll just continue to spawn

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.300 
because they'll just continue to spawn
there<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.020> sure<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.740> game<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.950> was<00:03:06.130> also

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
there for sure and this game I was also

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.770 
there for sure and this game I was also
probably<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.790> best<00:03:07.000> for<00:03:07.209> killstreaks<00:03:07.660> as

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
probably the best for killstreaks as

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.720 
probably the best for killstreaks as
well<00:03:07.959> because<00:03:08.350> they'll<00:03:08.920> continue<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> spawn

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
well because they'll continue to spawn

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.160 
well because they'll continue to spawn
in<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.910> same<00:03:10.120> spot<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.630> your<00:03:10.780> kill<00:03:10.930> streak

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
in the same spot and your kill streak

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.990 
in the same spot and your kill streak
will<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.620> know<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:11.739> no<00:03:12.610> matter<00:03:12.760> what

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
will just you know just no matter what

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.479 
will just you know just no matter what
it<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.480> Loadstar<00:03:14.019> VTOL<00:03:14.950> or<00:03:15.220> whatever

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
it is it's a Loadstar VTOL or whatever

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.490 
it is it's a Loadstar VTOL or whatever
it's<00:03:15.760> definitely<00:03:16.570> really<00:03:16.810> easy<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.290> rack<00:03:17.470> up

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
it's definitely really easy to rack up

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.380 
it's definitely really easy to rack up

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
pretty much only recommend playing in a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.979 
pretty much only recommend playing in a
party<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:27.910> six<00:03:28.180> because<00:03:28.420> what<00:03:28.600> i'm<00:03:28.690> doing

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
party of six because what i'm doing

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.509 
party of six because what i'm doing
doesn't<00:03:29.170> work<00:03:29.440> unless<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.830> have<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.040> party<00:03:30.430> of

doesn't work unless you have a party of
six<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.080> definitely

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
six and you know it's definitely

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.620 
six and you know it's definitely
extremely<00:03:33.070> easy<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.850> hold<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> spawns<00:03:34.420> they

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
extremely easy to hold the spawns they

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.120 
extremely easy to hold the spawns they
do<00:03:34.750> break<00:03:34.959> out<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> little<00:03:35.380> bit<00:03:35.560> here<00:03:35.739> on<00:03:35.830> this<00:03:35.920> a

anymore<00:03:53.920> just<00:03:54.220> because<00:03:54.660> pretty<00:03:55.660> much<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
anymore just because pretty much the

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
at like i am myself so it's a lot easier

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.980 
at like i am myself so it's a lot easier
for<00:04:01.570> my<00:04:01.780> katie<00:04:01.989> and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
for my katie and

I don't know I just seem to be enjoying
it<00:04:04.580> better<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.820> don't<00:04:04.910> keep<00:04:05.150> getting<00:04:05.420> spawned

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
it better I don't keep getting spawned

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.360 
it better I don't keep getting spawned
in<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.930> back<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.350> even<00:04:06.590> people<00:04:06.860> with<00:04:07.100> ghosts

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
in the back and even people with ghosts

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.800 
in the back and even people with ghosts
it's<00:04:07.730> kind<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:07.940> easy<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.270> determine<00:04:08.510> where

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
it's kind of easy to determine where

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.080 
it's kind of easy to determine where
they<00:04:08.930> are
