makeup

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.770 
makeup
and<00:04:55.860> when<00:04:56.039> I<00:04:56.069> use<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.699> white<00:04:56.879> wash<00:04:57.150> cloth<00:04:57.479> I

and when I use the white wash cloth I

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.700 
and when I use the white wash cloth I
did<00:04:58.139> have<00:04:58.530> some<00:04:58.979> makeup<00:04:59.370> on<00:04:59.520> so<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.569> did<00:05:00.930> leave

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
did have some makeup on so it did leave

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.999 
did have some makeup on so it did leave
some<00:05:02.580> makeup<00:05:03.180> on<00:05:03.360> my<00:05:03.539> face<00:05:03.569> it<00:05:03.990> didn't<00:05:04.379> do<00:05:04.979> a

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
some makeup on my face it didn't do a

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.189 
some makeup on my face it didn't do a
hundred<00:05:05.340> percent<00:05:05.580> job<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.360> removing<00:05:06.810> all<00:05:07.139> the

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
hundred percent job of removing all the

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.999 
hundred percent job of removing all the
makeup<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.280> that's<00:05:08.699> kind<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.210> negative<00:05:09.629> two

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.409 
makeup so that's kind of a negative two
which<00:05:11.009> I<00:05:11.250> guess<00:05:11.430> is<00:05:11.460> good<00:05:11.669> reason<00:05:12.120> why<00:05:12.360> you

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.409 
that's not a problem at all and yeah
like<00:07:11.860> I<00:07:12.010> said<00:07:12.280> it<00:07:12.400> doesn't<00:07:12.430> forget<00:07:12.910> your<00:07:13.090> skin

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
like I said it doesn't forget your skin

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:15.510 
like I said it doesn't forget your skin
doesn't<00:07:14.230> irritate<00:07:14.560> your<00:07:14.860> skin<00:07:14.919> so<00:07:15.340> I<00:07:15.370> think

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
doesn't irritate your skin so I think

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.870 
doesn't irritate your skin so I think
that's<00:07:15.880> a<00:07:16.060> huge<00:07:16.389> huge<00:07:16.600> plus<00:07:16.900> now<00:07:17.650> as<00:07:18.100> far<00:07:18.430> as<00:07:18.490> me

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
that's a huge huge plus now as far as me

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.180 
that's a huge huge plus now as far as me
repurchasing<00:07:19.840> this<00:07:19.870> and<00:07:20.320> although<00:07:20.889> it<00:07:21.040> is<00:07:21.160> a

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
repurchasing this and although it is a

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.640 
repurchasing this and although it is a
great<00:07:21.490> price<00:07:21.729> I'm<00:07:22.449> probably<00:07:22.960> more<00:07:23.290> prone<00:07:23.620> to

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
great price I'm probably more prone to

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.340 
great price I'm probably more prone to
try<00:07:24.100> something<00:07:24.550> else<00:07:24.729> I<00:07:25.090> didn't<00:07:25.630> dislike<00:07:25.930> this

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.350 
try something else I didn't dislike this

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.680 
try something else I didn't dislike this
product<00:07:26.830> I'll<00:07:27.220> continue<00:07:27.729> to<00:07:28.060> use<00:07:28.300> it<00:07:28.540> until

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
product I'll continue to use it until

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.540 
product I'll continue to use it until
it's<00:07:29.020> gone<00:07:29.229> but<00:07:29.979> I<00:07:30.010> probably<00:07:30.340> won't

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
it's gone but I probably won't

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.610 
it's gone but I probably won't
repurchase<00:07:31.360> this<00:07:31.540> product<00:07:31.990> again<00:07:32.110> just

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
repurchase this product again just

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.939 
repurchase this product again just
because<00:07:33.100> it<00:07:33.820> didn't<00:07:34.180> do<00:07:35.139> the<00:07:35.290> best<00:07:35.560> job<00:07:35.770> of

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
because it didn't do the best job of

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.820 
because it didn't do the best job of
removing<00:07:36.490> and<00:07:36.850> plus<00:07:37.060> i<00:07:37.330> like<00:07:37.419> i<00:07:38.020> said<00:07:38.260> i<00:07:38.410> like

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830 
removing and plus i like i said i like

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.150 
removing and plus i like i said i like
to<00:07:39.010> use<00:07:39.040> makeup<00:07:39.370> removing<00:07:40.120> costs<00:07:40.570> to<00:07:40.780> just

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 
to use makeup removing costs to just

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.490 
to use makeup removing costs to just
quickly<00:07:42.160> do<00:07:42.490> it<00:07:42.639> and<00:07:42.790> go<00:07:42.910> ahead<00:07:43.180> so<00:07:43.660> the<00:07:44.290> fact

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.500 
quickly do it and go ahead so the fact

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.050 
quickly do it and go ahead so the fact
that<00:07:44.590> i<00:07:44.740> have<00:07:44.830> to<00:07:44.950> wash<00:07:45.130> my<00:07:45.340> face<00:07:45.490> afterwards

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
that i have to wash my face afterwards

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.040 
that i have to wash my face afterwards
kind<00:07:46.690> of<00:07:46.870> takes<00:07:47.110> away<00:07:47.260> from<00:07:47.620> that<00:07:47.740> so<00:07:48.190> um

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.050 
kind of takes away from that so um

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.330 
kind of takes away from that so um
overall<00:07:50.050> I'd<00:07:50.380> probably<00:07:50.620> rate<00:07:50.889> this<00:07:51.040> about<00:07:51.280> a

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:51.340 
overall I'd probably rate this about a

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.520 
overall I'd probably rate this about a
three<00:07:51.820> or<00:07:51.850> three<00:07:52.360> and<00:07:52.450> a<00:07:52.479> half<00:07:52.510> out<00:07:52.870> of<00:07:52.930> five<00:07:53.020> I

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:53.530 
three or three and a half out of five I

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.250 
three or three and a half out of five I
mean<00:07:54.460> it's<00:07:54.610> not<00:07:54.729> a<00:07:54.790> bad<00:07:55.000> product<00:07:55.330> but<00:07:55.750> like<00:07:56.139> I

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.260 
mean it's not a bad product but like I

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.730 
mean it's not a bad product but like I
said<00:07:57.479> you<00:07:58.479> know<00:07:58.600> that's<00:07:58.990> just<00:07:59.080> it<00:07:59.410> doesn't

00:07:59.730 --> 00:07:59.740 
said you know that's just it doesn't

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.950 
said you know that's just it doesn't
really
