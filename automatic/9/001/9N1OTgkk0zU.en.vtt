00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.670 
potential once it's thrown away which
makes<00:07:38.880> it<00:07:39.090> evolved<00:07:39.390> into<00:07:39.720> Pinet<00:07:40.170> but<00:07:40.530> that

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 
makes it evolved into Pinet but that

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.600 
makes it evolved into Pinet but that
sounds<00:07:41.070> stupid

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
sounds stupid

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.520 
sounds stupid
so<00:07:41.850> shop<00:07:42.210> it<00:07:42.360> doesn't<00:07:42.690> really<00:07:42.870> come<00:07:43.200> into<00:07:43.260> play

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530 
so shop it doesn't really come into play

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.190 
so shop it doesn't really come into play
in<00:07:43.980> any<00:07:44.220> of<00:07:44.340> this<00:07:44.640> I'll<00:07:45.030> let<00:07:45.480> you<00:07:45.690> figure<00:07:45.990> out

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.200 
in any of this I'll let you figure out

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.110 
in any of this I'll let you figure out
why<00:07:46.470> had<00:07:46.650> to<00:07:46.770> get<00:07:46.920> thrown<00:07:47.190> away<00:07:47.370> to<00:07:47.550> make<00:07:47.820> shop

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
why had to get thrown away to make shop

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.850 
why had to get thrown away to make shop
it<00:07:48.270> come<00:07:48.480> to<00:07:48.630> life<00:07:48.810> put<00:07:49.170> it<00:07:49.260> this<00:07:49.380> way<00:07:49.620> if

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 
it come to life put it this way if

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.770 
it come to life put it this way if
someone<00:07:50.220> never<00:07:50.550> throw<00:07:50.880> away<00:07:50.910> what<00:07:51.330> shop<00:07:51.630> it

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 
someone never throw away what shop it

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.720 
someone never throw away what shop it
comes<00:07:51.990> to<00:07:52.200> life<00:07:52.380> from<00:07:52.650> then<00:07:53.040> maybe<00:07:53.280> the<00:07:53.520> kid

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:53.730 
comes to life from then maybe the kid

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.250 
comes to life from then maybe the kid
that<00:07:53.880> froze<00:07:54.150> the<00:07:54.300> way<00:07:54.420> their<00:07:54.630> plushie<00:07:54.870> would
