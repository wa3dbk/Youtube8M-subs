how to farm some human effigies so I

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.820 
how to farm some human effigies so I
believe<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> most<00:00:13.410> effective<00:00:13.799> way

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
believe this is the most effective way

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.620 
believe this is the most effective way
to<00:00:13.980> farm<00:00:14.280> human<00:00:14.549> effigies<00:00:14.880> there's<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.480> couple

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to farm human effigies there's a couple

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.910 
to farm human effigies there's a couple
other<00:00:15.839> places<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.320> game<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
other places in the game you can do it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.130 
other places in the game you can do it
but<00:00:17.369> doing<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.330> majula<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.810> definitely

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
but doing it in majula you definitely

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
but doing it in majula you definitely
get<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.320> most<00:00:19.470> bang<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.920> buck<00:00:20.070> so

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
get the most bang for your buck so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.490 
get the most bang for your buck so
you're<00:00:21.630> actually<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:22.020> you're<00:00:22.109> gonna<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
you're actually what you're gonna do is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
you're actually what you're gonna do is
you're<00:00:22.650> gonna<00:00:22.710> use<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> bonfire<00:00:23.430> aesthetic<00:00:23.850> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
you're gonna use a bonfire aesthetic in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
you're gonna use a bonfire aesthetic in
the<00:00:25.199> module<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> bonfire<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.220> might<00:00:26.609> seem

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the module a bonfire which might seem

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
the module a bonfire which might seem
kind<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> weird<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.680> guys<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.010> been

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
kind of weird but if you guys have been

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
kind of weird but if you guys have been
in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.880> mansion<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.109> probably

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
in the the mansion then you probably

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.659 
in the the mansion then you probably
know<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> skeleton<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> basement

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
know there's a skeleton in the basement

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
know there's a skeleton in the basement
and<00:00:33.000> he<00:00:33.570> drops<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> human<00:00:34.079> effigy<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.890> basically

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
and he drops a human effigy so basically

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
and he drops a human effigy so basically
what<00:00:35.430> happens<00:00:35.700> when<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> bonfire

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
what happens when you use a bonfire

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
what happens when you use a bonfire
aesthetic<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> module<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> bonfire<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
aesthetic in the module of bonfire is it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
aesthetic in the module of bonfire is it
will<00:00:39.360> respawn<00:00:39.629> him<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.530> also<00:00:40.739> add

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
will respawn him but it will also add

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
will respawn him but it will also add
another<00:00:41.219> skeleton<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> basement<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
another skeleton to the basement and the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
another skeleton to the basement and the
effect<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.860> stack<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.610> seven

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
effect will stack up to about seven

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
effect will stack up to about seven
times<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.050> by<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.320> seventh<00:00:46.620> bonfire

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
times I think so by your seventh bonfire

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
times I think so by your seventh bonfire
aesthetic<00:00:47.370> you're<00:00:47.489> gonna<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.789> eight

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
aesthetic you're gonna have eight

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
aesthetic you're gonna have eight
skeletons<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> basement<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.379> they're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
skeletons in the basement and they're

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
skeletons in the basement and they're
all<00:00:49.920> guaranteed<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.670> drop<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.969> effigy<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.170> if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
which you know is usually not so bad but

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
which you know is usually not so bad but
when<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:09.810> you're<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.020> new<00:01:10.170> game<00:01:10.350> plus

when you're when you're on new game plus
9<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.909> pretty<00:01:12.090> fucking<00:01:12.630> tricky<00:01:13.549> so

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
what I think is a defective strategy

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
what I think is a defective strategy
definitely<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> caster<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:20.060> you

what<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> did<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
what I did here was I'm not really a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
what I did here was I'm not really a
caster<00:01:38.850> too<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.509> spells<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
caster too much like I have spells but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
caster too much like I have spells but
I'm<00:01:40.829> mostly<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.490> used<00:01:41.670> pyromancy<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I'm mostly just like used pyromancy so I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
I'm mostly just like used pyromancy so I
used<00:01:42.899> flame<00:01:43.140> swath<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.790> use

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
used flame swath but you can also use

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.460 
used flame swath but you can also use
like<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.299> know<00:01:45.390> firestorm<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> stuff<00:01:46.290> but

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like you know firestorm and stuff but

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.429 
like you know firestorm and stuff but
that's<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.770> little<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.130> risky<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> would

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that's a little more risky but I would

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.510 
that's a little more risky but I would
just<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:49.860> run<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.460> would

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just I would run in there and I would

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
just I would run in there and I would
flame<00:01:50.790> swath<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.860> would

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
flame swath them and you know that would

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
flame swath them and you know that would
usually<00:01:53.670> kill<00:01:53.850> most<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
usually kill most of them and then the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.630 
usually kill most of them and then the
rest<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:56.549> would

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
rest that would kind of just they would

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
rest that would kind of just they would
funnel<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.840> try

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
funnel out I would kind of just like try

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.580 
funnel out I would kind of just like try
to<00:01:58.079> take<00:01:58.290> him<00:01:58.439> out<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.680> by<00:01:58.829> one<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:01.020> once<00:02:01.530> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to take him out one by one but once you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.050 
to take him out one by one but once you
get<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.920> five<00:02:02.100> skeletons<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> gets

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
get up to like five skeletons it gets

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.380 
get up to like five skeletons it gets
pretty<00:02:03.420> difficult<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.990> do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
pretty difficult to do

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.810 
pretty difficult to do
with<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.050> know<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.350> melee<00:02:05.620> strategy<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.790> you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
with you know the melee strategy so you

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.370 
with you know the melee strategy so you
definitely<00:02:06.940> definitely<00:02:07.660> need<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.200> some

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
definitely definitely need like some

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.139 
definitely definitely need like some
sort<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.679> spell<00:02:09.220> otherwise<00:02:09.700> it's<00:02:09.880> gonna<00:02:09.940> take

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
sort of spell otherwise it's gonna take

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.170 
sort of spell otherwise it's gonna take
it<00:02:10.240> really<00:02:10.330> long<00:02:10.539> time<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.730> also<00:02:12.850> run<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
it really long time and you also run the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.510 
it really long time and you also run the
risk<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.450> getting<00:02:13.570> killed<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:15.280> happened

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
risk of getting killed and that happened

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430 
risk of getting killed and that happened
to<00:02:15.580> me<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> few<00:02:15.820> times<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.810> would<00:02:17.080> kill<00:02:17.260> like

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
to me a few times I I would kill like

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.020 
to me a few times I I would kill like
about<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.800> five<00:02:18.100> or<00:02:18.250> six<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.520> them<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.850> then

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
about like five or six of them and then

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.400 
about like five or six of them and then
the<00:02:19.240> last<00:02:19.390> one<00:02:19.600> would<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.900> me<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> would

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the last one would get me and I would

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
the last one would get me and I would
lose<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.220> effigies<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.580> I'd<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> do

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
lose all the effigies and I'd have to do

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.590 
lose all the effigies and I'd have to do
it<00:02:22.180> again

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
it again

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.570

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
this is good to do in conjunction with a

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.640 
this is good to do in conjunction with a
few<00:02:28.060> different<00:02:28.330> things<00:02:28.530> specifically<00:02:29.530> the
