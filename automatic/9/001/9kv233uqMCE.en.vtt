kind of looks like ash to me basically

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.400 
kind of looks like ash to me basically
it's<00:00:21.220> in<00:00:21.400> pretty<00:00:21.640> good<00:00:21.820> shape<00:00:21.880> but<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:22.900> top<00:00:23.170> is

reglue<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:39.040> I'm<00:00:39.729> going<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.940> reattach<00:00:40.449> it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
reglue it and I'm going to reattach it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.829 
reglue it and I'm going to reattach it
in<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:41.860> manner<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.430> will<00:00:42.760> allow<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.299> to<00:00:43.330> expand

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
in a manner that will allow it to expand

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.380 
in a manner that will allow it to expand
and<00:00:43.900> contract<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.589> seasons<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.940> top<00:00:46.180> has

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
and contract the seasons the top has

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.539 
and contract the seasons the top has
really<00:00:46.659> been<00:00:46.809> scarred<00:00:47.199> up<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:47.680> don't<00:00:48.309> know<00:00:48.489> if

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
really been scarred up I don't know if

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.969 
really been scarred up I don't know if
it's<00:00:48.699> from<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.970> previous<00:00:49.750> refinishing<00:00:50.379> job<00:00:50.619> or

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
it's from a previous refinishing job or

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.520 
it's from a previous refinishing job or
what<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:52.390> some<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.869> some<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.260> marks

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
what but some of the some of the marks

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.219 
what but some of the some of the marks
look<00:00:53.710> like<00:00:53.860> belt<00:00:54.129> sanding<00:00:54.549> marks<00:00:55.019> some<00:00:56.019> just

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
look like belt sanding marks some just

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
look like belt sanding marks some just
like<00:00:56.409> scrapes<00:00:56.799> and<00:00:57.010> gouges

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.240 
okay so I took this shelf out and now
I'm<00:01:09.940> going<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.330> see<00:01:10.450> if<00:01:10.540> I<00:01:10.600> can<00:01:10.780> tap<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.250> top

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
I'm going to see if I can tap that top

00:01:12.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
I'm going to see if I can tap that top
up<00:01:12.520> enough<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.810> loosen<00:01:14.200> it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.080 

the<00:02:19.900> tops<00:02:20.170> all<00:02:20.410> reglued<00:02:20.950> ready<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.700> reattach

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the tops all reglued ready to reattach

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.510 
the tops all reglued ready to reattach
to<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.420> case<00:02:22.710> I'm<00:02:23.710> not<00:02:23.770> going<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.250> nail<00:02:24.490> it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
to the case I'm not going to nail it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.290 
to the case I'm not going to nail it
back<00:02:24.910> down<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.960> was<00:02:26.110> originally<00:02:27.300> what

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
back down like it was originally what

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.910 
back down like it was originally what
I'm<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.570> do<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.080> build<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.710> some

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
I'm going to do is I build up some

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.750 
I'm going to do is I build up some
boards<00:02:30.390> which<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.810> will<00:02:32.530> screw<00:02:32.800> down<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.610> this

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
boards which I will screw down to this

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.670 
boards which I will screw down to this
kicker<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:35.560> here<00:02:36.210> two<00:02:37.210> boards<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:38.380> before

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
kicker that's here two boards but before

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.620 
kicker that's here two boards but before
I<00:02:38.740> do<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.850> make<00:02:40.060> some<00:02:40.300> slots

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
I do that I'm going to make some slots

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.550 
I do that I'm going to make some slots
in<00:02:41.010> four<00:02:42.010> different<00:02:42.160> places<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.880> each<00:02:43.000> board

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
in four different places on each board

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.990 
in four different places on each board
through<00:02:44.560> which<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:44.950> can<00:02:45.010> screw<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.550> top<00:02:45.730> down

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
through which I can screw the top down

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.540 
through which I can screw the top down
and<00:02:46.210> those<00:02:46.630> slots<00:02:46.990> will<00:02:47.260> allow<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.620> top<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
and those slots will allow the top to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:03:19.200 
and those slots will allow the top to
expand<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.090> contract<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.780> needed

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.290 

okay<00:03:20.210> now<00:03:20.390> I've<00:03:20.510> got<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.870> sand<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.710> top<00:03:21.980> and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
okay now I've got to sand this top and
