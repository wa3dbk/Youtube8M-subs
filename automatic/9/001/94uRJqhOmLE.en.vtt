 Here we have a roll 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.990
 I do not like when these ends you me 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.110
 I don't like it so I cut them off and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.030
 I do not cut the roll in half so it is more convenient 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.750
 will arrange your container such 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.020
 A simple snack option is prepared very 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.530
 quick and easy to take with you do not need 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.649
 to warm it up the main thing is not to keep very 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.690
 long sun otherwise spoil 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.269

 fix a little olive oil 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.060
 but in my practice whenever 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.730
 a little salad costs him juice 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.400
