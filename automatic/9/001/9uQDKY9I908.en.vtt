00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.910
 a French patent that tears 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 fully patented in rain knitted with deep 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.900
 stitched stitches 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.509
 but a few others did not 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 So I showed in previous video 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:27.480
 the former becomes a preparatory three 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 his and his father's on the right 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.070
 is left that means I have one here 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.429
 right side first preparation purely 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.519
 I still have a hand here all 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:49.829
 mesh straps hand made lifting 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:59.670
 I now the first series and indeed 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:03.269
 on the back, free hand and mesh 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 now a mesh is stung deep 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:11.610
 and others simply knitted sway 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.390
 now in the pattern with a tv 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.920
 stitched mesh a row deep that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 it's normal mesh and a row tv 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.540
 do not knit and the second just 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 right 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.620
 she forgets right and once 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.460
 on the right our change a stitch 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.270
 lower right knit a machine 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 normal right no left mesh now 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 not every second bit precise 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 work exactly the mesh one purely 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:59.220
 down lower right normal 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.520
 deep times to the train to the very end to the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.520
 purse 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.350
 in the engraved with a deeper and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.350
 the edge marches considerably 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:27.129
 the third row now one again 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:29.260
 right side and mesh we have with 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.970
 a stitched lower stitch finished 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.660
 now she becomes a normal silent 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.739
 normal measure does not knit and the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:46.019
 normal attitudes are now deeper one 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:57.549
 relative once normally deeper and deeper 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:59.549
 deeper deeper deeper normal again 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.440
 pure end 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.950
 and we change these with a normal one 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.519
 Real mesh and swift so now 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.329
 Let us repeat this last 223 always 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.280
 The first choice preparation always has to be 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.290
 either follow as always with 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.930
 a deeply engraved stitch 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.769
 or in the other with a rhein 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.079
 direction mesh 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.870
 Now we have a normal direction 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.000
 ash also made an end 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.730
 now she will be a deeper one 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.299
 plans and we drive now 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.260
 your deeper pierced always one 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:43.419
 put a series of lessons and a normal 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:48.970
 is a deep and with it the whole 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:50.889
 row end, they keep on watching 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.290
 apart then they could also easier 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:59.919
 a stitch last stab deeper 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.709
 stitched and the edge stitch we have 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.450
 with deeper pierced ends 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.919
 this page will be a real one 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:14.459
 mesh with mesh and we start with 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:18.760
 a direction leeste and reached deep 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.829
 normal dishes deep and so repeat 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.240
 she the 23 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:28.539
 the whole time normally in the patent 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.569
 pattern is only two rows given that 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.219
 spring pattern when you take a shower 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.289
 have and then they do not know in 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:37.330
 which series is what you have just 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.330
 was in the beginning still stung 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.759
 normal probably pieces is in the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.669
 purse 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:48.009
 if you have only one thread here then 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.710
 it is time to sting dtv 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.729
 if here to keep under the brand 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.169
 to have 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.599
 then she will now normal mesh 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.389
 stuck so now here is a thread 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.919
 there we catch we catch and we end 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.150
 with a pine stitched mesh in 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.719
 the thread with double thread 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.110
 she is not stuck normally 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:13.240
 more effective and everyone is normal 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.210
 the good is and the pattern we need 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.300
 no left stitches is possible the 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.580
 mesh , the mesh almost hide 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.879
 As if in a circle , nothing comes here 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.029
 Great comes from patent and that would 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.520
 now after only a few rows only the ones see 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:33.639
 we have just under the needle 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.870
 will look frizzy as long as he is 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.870
 did not turn off 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.950
 we already see a little bit of that 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.860
 patent here I have normal 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.070
 classical stuck and from here is 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.830
 this new french new concert 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.980
 patent of the first series 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.920
 we have already knitted the 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.340
 first four we see two pure with 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.500
 two great powers in stitches and the rate 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.570
 herb is subject to the needle 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.280
 the looks with in the circle right if 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.680
 knit right here then on the 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.550
 on the other side they appear on the left so 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.850
 we see the left do when they are 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.800
 steadily repeat these two rows 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.570
 then the whole had also I have done 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.700
 I have the whole piece in this one now 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.740
 knitted french patent pattern 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.120
 and now I am on the right side 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.220
 if you see if just one 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.070
 page was made 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.170
 Here everything looks fine after the patent though 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.980
 if you turn around then you have to first 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.690
 be careful with it on the sides 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.990
 they have to disappear on the right side 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.550
 this up in the knitting and 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.040
 finish pattern 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.130
 then looks so good on this page too 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.620
 Look like it's on the right page 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.150
 should 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.870
 and now just compare them all 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.630
 pattern normal classic patent 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.150
 pattern and this french patent 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.110
 pattern I once have this one 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.540
 You simply put the chair together 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:23.440
 indiscriminately lean but otherwise otherwise 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.440
 it 's pretty similar if not even 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.240
 to say it's absolutely the same as me 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.040
 Try now ribs and under the 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.460
 Actually, girls pretty much do that 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.840
 similar looks pretty much the same the 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.080
 only difference is the only one 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.590
 difference is the classic patente 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.420
 mesh 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.900
 They're a bit deeper from that 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.060
 a bit the deeper furrows 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.880
 and the French is a little bit 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.620
 easier to follow, I hope 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.240
 I helped behind one 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:01.270
 classic patent pattern of four types 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:04.150
 knit it makes a lot of fun and I 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:08.340
 I hope that will be really good for her 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.340
 fun do something to be stuck to day
