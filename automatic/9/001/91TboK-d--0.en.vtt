to<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.780> ground<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.320> log<00:03:06.160> but<00:03:07.320> also

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
to the ground like that log but also

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.070 
to the ground like that log but also
something<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.980> very<00:03:09.310> much<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.209> you

something that I very much like is you

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.570 
something that I very much like is you
know<00:03:11.200> as<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.590> said<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.480> collars<00:03:13.480> video<00:03:14.580> his

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
know as I said in the collars video his

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.640 
know as I said in the collars video his
buildings<00:03:16.030> make<00:03:16.180> sense<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.959> as<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.260> can<00:03:17.410> see

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
buildings make sense so as you can see

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.240 
buildings make sense so as you can see
his<00:03:18.300> bottom<00:03:19.300> layer<00:03:19.510> are<00:03:19.840> made<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.230> stone<00:03:20.500> so

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
his bottom layer are made of stone so

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.150 
his bottom layer are made of stone so
that<00:03:21.550> means<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:22.300> day<00:03:22.810> supported<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.620> looks

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
that means a day supported and looks

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.300 
that means a day supported and looks
realistic<00:03:24.550> because<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.810> stone<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.310> moving

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
realistic because it is stone and moving

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.060 
realistic because it is stone and moving
up<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.850> can<00:03:28.060> see<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.870> building's<00:03:29.350> ghost

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
up you can see that the building's ghost

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.210 
up you can see that the building's ghost
gross<00:03:30.580> from<00:03:30.850> stone<00:03:31.239> like<00:03:31.750> he<00:03:32.739> added<00:03:33.070> these

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
gross from stone like he added these

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.310 
gross from stone like he added these
things<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.730> kind<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.970> make<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.180> blend<00:03:34.660> in<00:03:35.110> and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
things to kind of make it blend in and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.940 
things to kind of make it blend in and
it<00:03:36.160> goes<00:03:36.370> from<00:03:36.519> stone<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.360> wood<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.959> then<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
it goes from stone to wood and then the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.860 
it goes from stone to wood and then the
tower<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.310> obviously<00:03:39.880> again<00:03:40.269> supported<00:03:40.780> by

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
tower is obviously again supported by

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.210 
tower is obviously again supported by
stone<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.800> his<00:03:42.330> material<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.690> very<00:03:43.830> nicely<00:03:44.830> you

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
stone so his material is very nicely you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.150 
stone so his material is very nicely you
know<00:03:45.310> thought<00:03:45.610> about<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.830> that's<00:03:47.920> something

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160

as you can see here he made this paid a
dark<00:03:55.840> at<00:03:55.959> her<00:03:56.049> collar<00:03:56.440> just<00:03:57.160> for<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.370> fact

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
dark at her collar just for the fact

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.130 
dark at her collar just for the fact
that<00:03:57.700> he<00:03:57.850> didn't<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.269> detail<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.989> that

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
that he didn't have to detail it that

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.680 
that he didn't have to detail it that
much<00:03:59.350> as<00:03:59.620> you<00:04:00.040> can<00:04:00.190> see<00:04:00.430> here<00:04:00.730> he<00:04:01.090> had<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.480> deal

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
much as you can see here he had to deal

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.000 
much as you can see here he had to deal
tail<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.140> because<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.709> bigger<00:04:02.950> surface

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
tail it because it's a bigger surface

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.410 
tail it because it's a bigger surface
see<00:04:06.010> that's<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:06.400> that's<00:04:06.910> something<00:04:07.390> that

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
see that's that's that's something that

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.930 
see that's that's that's something that
you<00:04:08.260> know<00:04:08.380> he's<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.620> resemblance<00:04:09.040> off<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.850> know

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
you know he's a resemblance off you know

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.720 
you know he's a resemblance off you know
in<00:04:10.060> my<00:04:10.209> opinion<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.950> snow<00:04:12.220> takes<00:04:12.580> a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
in my opinion it's just the snow takes a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.580 
in my opinion it's just the snow takes a
little<00:04:12.910> bit<00:04:13.090> away<00:04:13.299> if<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> attention<00:04:14.170> at<00:04:14.470> the

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
little bit away if the attention at the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.860 
little bit away if the attention at the
inside<00:04:14.980> which<00:04:15.250> makes<00:04:15.580> him<00:04:15.850> not<00:04:16.209> having<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.720> do

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
inside which makes him not having to do

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.009 
inside which makes him not having to do
too<00:04:17.109> much<00:04:17.320> detail<00:04:17.769> but<00:04:17.950> again<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:19.090> Canada<00:04:19.840> not

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
too much detail but again the Canada not

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.930 
too much detail but again the Canada not
detail<00:04:20.530> at<00:04:20.709> some<00:04:21.040> points<00:04:21.459> make<00:04:21.640> it<00:04:21.789> look

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
detail at some points make it look

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.730 
detail at some points make it look
better<00:04:22.090> because<00:04:22.720> as<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.110> can<00:04:23.140> see<00:04:23.260> here<00:04:23.620> he

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
better because as you can see here he

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.310 
better because as you can see here he
asked<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:24.160> has<00:04:24.310> plain<00:04:24.820> spots<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:26.110> just

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
asked just has plain spots but you just

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.460 
asked just has plain spots but you just
don't<00:04:26.470> mind<00:04:26.590> because<00:04:27.070> it

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
don't mind because it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.300 
don't mind because it
good<00:04:29.170> to<00:04:30.170> that's<00:04:30.350> something<00:04:30.650> he<00:04:30.740> does<00:04:30.920> really

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
good to that's something he does really

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.670 
good to that's something he does really
well<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.270> something<00:04:32.750> that's<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.530> know<00:04:33.560> a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
well and and something that's you know a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.710 
well and and something that's you know a
common<00:04:34.220> thing<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.460> ol<00:04:34.790> biller<00:04:35.180> should<00:04:35.510> know

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
common thing that ol biller should know

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.460 
common thing that ol biller should know
is<00:04:36.340> randomization<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.490> he<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.320> the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
is randomization and he it's like the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.010 
is randomization and he it's like the
definition<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.250> randomization<00:04:41.090> look<00:04:41.300> there's

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
definition of randomization look there's

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.930 
definition of randomization look there's
like<00:04:42.200> no<00:04:42.470> surface<00:04:42.980> with<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.160> same<00:04:43.460> material

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
like no surface with the same material

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.610 
like no surface with the same material
other<00:04:44.060> than<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.450> roof<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:44.930> even<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.380> roof

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
other than the roof and even the roof

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.600 
other than the roof and even the roof
has<00:04:45.830> two<00:04:46.040> types<00:04:46.310> of<00:04:46.460> collars<00:04:47.080> it's<00:04:48.080> just

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
has two types of collars it's just

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.950 
has two types of collars it's just
that's<00:04:49.610> something<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.510> want<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.810> do

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
that's something that you want to do

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.840 
that's something that you want to do
it's<00:04:51.260> just<00:04:51.530> like<00:04:51.710> if<00:04:51.920> you<00:04:52.100> if<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.610> have<00:04:52.820> a

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
it's just like if you if you have a

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.820 
it's just like if you if you have a
brown<00:04:53.270> thing<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:53.840> should<00:04:54.020> cantinho<00:04:54.440> mix<00:04:54.710> it

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
brown thing you should cantinho mix it

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.520 
brown thing you should cantinho mix it
up<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.280> mean<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.640> even<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.090> these<00:04:56.930> sorts<00:04:57.380> of

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
up I mean and even in these sorts of

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.290 
up I mean and even in these sorts of
buildings<00:04:57.890> that<00:04:58.100> will<00:04:58.280> look<00:04:58.460> good<00:04:58.640> some

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
buildings that will look good some

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.240 
buildings that will look good some
buildings<00:04:59.690> just<00:04:59.750> are<00:05:00.200> not<00:05:00.500> suited<00:05:01.010> for<00:05:01.220> that

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
buildings just are not suited for that

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.420 
buildings just are not suited for that
my<00:05:02.240> builds<00:05:02.630> tend<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.020> not<00:05:03.260> really<00:05:03.830> look<00:05:04.220> good

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
my builds tend to not really look good

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.720 
my builds tend to not really look good
doing<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:04.910> but<00:05:05.590> as<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:07.100> can<00:05:07.190> see<00:05:07.370> he's<00:05:07.520> done

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
doing that but as you can see he's done

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.390 
doing that but as you can see he's done
that<00:05:07.880> really<00:05:08.270> well<00:05:08.600> also<00:05:09.560> something<00:05:10.160> where

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
that really well also something where

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.830 
that really well also something where
I've<00:05:10.520> also<00:05:10.760> done<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.360> video<00:05:11.540> about<00:05:11.810> greenery<00:05:12.740> so

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
I've also done a video about greenery so

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.110 
I've also done a video about greenery so
he<00:05:14.840> as<00:05:15.200> you<00:05:15.440> can<00:05:15.560> see<00:05:15.830> if<00:05:16.070> I'm<00:05:16.580> doing<00:05:16.790> these

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
he as you can see if I'm doing these

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.120 
he as you can see if I'm doing these
kind<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.570> series<00:05:17.930> I'll<00:05:18.170> break<00:05:18.590> down<00:05:18.800> all<00:05:18.980> the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
kind of series I'll break down all the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.250 
kind of series I'll break down all the
things<00:05:19.340> that<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> have<00:05:19.730> done<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:20.360> one<00:05:20.660> video<00:05:21.050> as

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
things that I have done to one video as

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.640 
things that I have done to one video as
you<00:05:21.380> can<00:05:21.530> see<00:05:21.740> here<00:05:22.010> he's<00:05:22.669> added<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:24.020> green<00:05:24.380> I

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
you can see here he's added the green I

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.090 
you can see here he's added the green I
mean<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.760> have<00:05:25.910> green<00:05:26.360> in<00:05:26.600> your<00:05:26.780> town

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
sometimes not as many as other cities

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.560 
sometimes not as many as other cities
but<00:05:30.680> he<00:05:31.490> has<00:05:31.700> done<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.120> know<00:05:32.180> like<00:05:32.419> it

but he has done it you know like it
decides<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.200> buildings<00:05:33.560> also<00:05:34.250> even<00:05:34.490> he

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
decides of the buildings also even he

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.960 
decides of the buildings also even he
has<00:05:34.940> randomization<00:05:35.780> in<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:35.990> leaves<00:05:36.760> that's<00:05:37.760> a

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
has randomization in the leaves that's a

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.350 
has randomization in the leaves that's a
good<00:05:38.150> thing<00:05:38.330> see<00:05:39.169> and<00:05:39.470> i<00:05:39.500> just<00:05:39.650> added<00:05:40.360> random

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
good thing see and i just added random

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.740 
good thing see and i just added random
trees<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.410> you<00:05:42.560> know<00:05:42.650> it<00:05:42.860> all<00:05:43.790> together<00:05:44.210> it

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
trees and you know it all together it

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.469 
trees and you know it all together it
looks<00:05:44.780> like<00:05:45.229> a<00:05:45.260> great<00:05:45.710> atmosphere<00:05:46.479> just

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
looks like a great atmosphere just
