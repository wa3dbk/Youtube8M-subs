there and let's see here taking ham
where<00:02:46.069> are<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> CM

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
where are there we go and this is a CM

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.150

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
how much is going for if it's going for

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.360 
how much is going for if it's going for
a<00:02:53.780> lot<00:02:54.080> I'm<00:02:54.590> probably<00:02:54.830> not<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.310> be

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
a lot I'm probably not going to be

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.610 
a lot I'm probably not going to be
picking<00:02:55.610> them<00:02:55.819> up<00:02:55.970> as<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.750> see<00:02:56.959> he<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.170> not

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
picking them up as you can see he is not

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.949 
picking them up as you can see he is not
that<00:02:58.130> expensive<00:02:58.580> I'm<00:02:58.970> just<00:02:59.450> going<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.720> be

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
that expensive I'm just going to be

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.660 
that expensive I'm just going to be
bidding<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.349> him<00:03:00.530> again<00:03:00.709> but<00:03:01.099> as<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.430> can<00:03:01.489> see

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
bidding on him again but as you can see

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.990 
bidding on him again but as you can see
it's<00:03:01.819> not<00:03:01.940> too<00:03:02.150> expensive<00:03:02.180> actually<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.280> you

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
it's not too expensive actually so you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.729 
it's not too expensive actually so you
could<00:03:05.269> be<00:03:05.390> making<00:03:05.480> some<00:03:05.780> great<00:03:06.049> profit<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.560> him

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
could be making some great profit on him

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.520 
could be making some great profit on him
and<00:03:07.010> what<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.150> actually<00:03:08.330> happening<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:09.049> i<00:03:09.170> am

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
and what is actually happening here i am
