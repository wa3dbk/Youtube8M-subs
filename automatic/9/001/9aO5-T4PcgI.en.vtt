00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.020
 hello hello everyone and welcome to me 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.760
 first episode of the guide series of 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.139
 teams this time I'll be 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.119
 talking about how to play with one of my 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.520
 favorite teams of the game the bayern 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.410
 munich what is the best training that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.930
 players line up and a bit of gameplay 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.119
 using them well then let's start with the 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.490
 training with the bayern munich I like 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.170
 to use a 3-5-2 with two midfielders is 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.630
 simple and you wonder why three 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.860
 expense is simple is to not have to 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.230
 sacrifice any player in attack 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.000
 have offensive amplitude and achieve 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 excellent midfield pressure 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.030
 forward but you must be careful 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.500
 not to neglect the line of three 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 defenses since they are exposed 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.120
 easily now we go to the section of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.010
 the important players of the team and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.930
 first of all we have the great manual 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.090
 bride the archer with the best score 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.800
 of the incredible great reflection game 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.050
 positioning and without talking about their 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.090
 precision of passes even of sight 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.770
 balls with eyes haha 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 ok no but under the three bullets there 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.579
 we have any kind of inconvenience 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.770
 going to the defense now we're going with 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.539
 boateng one of the largest central 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.190
 spin speed of the game in addition to 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.050
 have a huge force and is the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.830
 defensive pillar of this team as 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.840
 you will see 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.880
 in the images there you have how to remove 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.640
 the balls as the steals how it sweeps 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.770
 he is a great player now we spend with 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.010
 schweinstaiger gentlemen that I can 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.100
 say short balls anticipates attacks 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.600
 defends, attends and makes goals, he is the one 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.030
 makes a difference in the midfield 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.590
 bayern munich but I know it's in the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.050
 part that matters most to you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.060
 attackers and we go with robben gentlemen 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.120
 robben without a doubt the best end 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.910
 fifa right 15 has excellent shot 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.520
 pass speed curve 90 points that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:52.240
 speak for itself nothing more see everything 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.670
 what can he do now we spend with mario 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.830
 götze one of my favorite players in 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.260
 real life three mile excellent good 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.300
 Attendant forms an excellent pair with 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.770
 Robert Lewandowski and enter with enough 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.170
 frequency the area as you can see in 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.850
 the videos the player is essential in 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.240
 this transition from the half court to 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.240
 front 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.160
 and to close with a flourish sir 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.980
 we have robert lewandowski sorry 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.870
 leaving his pieces the authentic 'killer' 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.330
 excellent finish both inside and outside 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.220
 of the area is skillful is an air threat 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.530
 its speed is a bit to be desired but 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.750
 his positioning is excellent always 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.300
 is there to finish the ball is strong 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.100
 and he is not allowed to remove it so easily 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.930
 even in 90 he does runs like 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.930
 these gentlemen is a real crack 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.560
 the other players complement the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.050
 already mentioned for example bennati praises 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.060
 they form a very good defense together as 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.380
 attentive and you're wondering why 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.240
 he used alan defensive midfielder 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.890
 it's as simple as having the 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.450
 Tactical ability and it's always good 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.340
 positioned to anticipate and annoy 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.780
 the rivals 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.390
 ribéry is excellent for his five 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.280
 drible stars but it's not that strong 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.590
 not as good as in previous figures and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.630
 müller is the ideal complement for 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.700
 the one 2 and since it takes care more of the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.110
 creation of the game but what does not 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.260
 They like their three stars too much 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.450
 of rivals 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.790
 but let's move on to the action 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.439
 use a 352 is to try to maintain the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.970
 position and position yourself extensively from the 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.060
 Start of the game to avoid bad 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.530
 times in defense with 352 you'll have many 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.510
 passing options two midfielders 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.250
 fast you will constantly remember 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.110
 by the band and two forwards that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.900
 will always be looking for spaces where 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.519
 is my recommendation touching 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.140
 enough the ball to have a base 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.180
 clear towards the forwards and as 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.069
 I explained previously a bad pass can 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.629
 mean an occasion or a bond against 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.790
 since the three pesos a little risk 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.560
 but once the timing picks up 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.859
 fun and effective summer that results 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.810
 do 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.640
 also the midfielders are in the 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.190
 bands will go down to make coverages 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.590
 you can constantly throw centers 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.840
 go to space your afternoons can give and 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.819
 dominate the ball the truth is the way 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 more fun to use the bayern munich 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.560
 in the game and they will provide you hours and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.959
 hours of fun 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.360
 follow me on my social networks there is a 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.060
 double floor I'll see it on twitter and facebook 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.920
