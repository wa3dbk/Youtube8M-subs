00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.200
 mystery farmers was with him that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 this bringing more a tutorial record 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.309
 so over 2013 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.460
 in this video you are creating a being 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.289
 multiplayer and finished 0 in wool ie 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.710
 eventually everyone wins the same 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.140
 internet connection is very cool 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.080
 easy to create, remembering that only 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 works in the original versions steam 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.649
 or cd first step you predicted that in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 multiplayer 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.290
 click create game because you do not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 click jong because you already say 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.840
 is for you to go into servers so I 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.379
 I wanted it to include game 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.199
 here you have to choose a map I chose 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.579
 the first one with more random then 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.289
 We had to start also here no one even 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 You name your farm 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 I recommend you put a name well 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 simple to facilitate and the pursuit of your 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 map and among the various services worldwide 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.200
 that rolls there is in research that is also 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 messy mess 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.070
 done this you see that internet 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 connection you can change here the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.970
 the internet according to your connection if 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.799
 know a little is weak for example a 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.799
 megan megabyte, do not you put a thousand 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.770
 You can play only two people. 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.909
 internet a little good so at 10 megs 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.670
 up 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.560
 You can put here 25,000 and you should 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.770
 You get up to 10 people here in Ulan more 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.930
 once their wool it will just play all 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.079
 world on the same internet connection 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.630
 here you can play up to 16 people 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.689
 It's really cool, I think it's interesting to play. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.170
 with a lot of people it's playing alone like this 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.219
 until some time until legal but after 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.189
 It got a little annoying that you did not 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.610
 can control is all two 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.899
 machines is to feed all animals 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.220
 correctly then 16 people 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.240
 It's cool, cool, but it has 16 computers. 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.860
 a tricky little word here is ask 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.030
 You put it just so I recommend it 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.740
 strongly you enter your password 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.420
 because it is if you do not put without 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.240
 anyone can enter your 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.570
 brain and may be destroying your 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.490
 these things as soon as possible. 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.950
 no one like you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.280
 done that put your password is fine 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.130
 simple that matters you'll have to 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.940
 put this number here on the door of your 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.920
 your modem may be blocked 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.050
 This mouth is not going to happen, he does not 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 It's going to explode or nothing is yours. 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.780
 unlock simply to free 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.160
 a connection port is exactly that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.380
 game that each game has a number 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.660
 I explained this to the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.220
 leave in the description for you to see the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.190
 to put exactly this number here 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.940
 otherwise she will make a mistake and that is well 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.440
 common 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.100
 but if you put everything right not 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 It will give no error here and I do not need 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.400
 select this option who is from r molds 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.350
 Here you are, you promise you 'll have one. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.250
 template on your computer 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.680
 if your mold your mold will have q ta 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.840
 with all the people all the guys from 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.200
 your server there will have to have the same 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.480
 template in the same version if it does not give and in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.790
 compatibility so you can not go 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.860
 is putting one way or another not 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.650
 because it will not appear in his then 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.630
 It's going to be a mistake and it's going to be pretty annoying for me. 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.630
 how is this here that is the way in 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.560
 classics that I'm show her in a 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.930
 previous video 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.630
 click save even though everything is 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.230
 right change the chemical connection to 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.080
 25,000 is not because no one wants to play 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.360
 with me this is how in start 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.130
 here is very interesting you put there 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.799
 may not have the 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.950
 difference of any of the 323 of the three 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:19.049
 options CNEC European if not me 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.489
 mistake he is German or something and 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.979
 international I run internationally 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.410
 because it is easier the European is not 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.260
 I put it because I think so. 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.430
 the pig that is a mother fees in that it has to 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.220
 be very low it is that if you miss one 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.500
 little layman then without putting a 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.360
 minimum you have to have the minimum of 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.850
 ping possible not to give leg 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.160
 and no one thought it was 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.230
 have this is for example the black ops 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.780
 two have more may not have to 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.510
 securities and coca serves international 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.390
 after that you click start which only 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.960
 will start normally any 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.280
 doubt any suggestion leaves the 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.210
 documentaries in the comment area there 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.990
 below, remembering that the other and leaving 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.730
 in the description it is very simple is if you 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.970
 Did you like this video? 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.460
 its liqing if you like series of 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.190
 way I have but never with 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.250
 some nice episodes the show is 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.150
 very good is it then so hopefully 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.280
 have enjoyed 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.280
 earned a hug and was
