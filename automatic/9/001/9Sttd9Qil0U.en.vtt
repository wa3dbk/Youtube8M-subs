00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
in India during independence and we we

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.800 
in India during independence and we we
saw<00:02:07.280> all<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.700> palaces<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.210> we<00:02:08.330> stayed<00:02:08.600> with

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
saw all the palaces and we stayed with

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.359 
saw all the palaces and we stayed with
some<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.170> Maharajah's<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.009> East<00:02:10.130> End<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
some the Maharajah's and East End the

a<00:02:11.690> very<00:02:11.840> different<00:02:12.260> India<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.700> think<00:02:13.910> it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
a very different India and I think it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.510 
a very different India and I think it
was<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:14.440> essential<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.860> understand

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
was very essential that you understand

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.760 
was very essential that you understand
both<00:02:16.670> sides<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.300> country<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.530> do

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
both sides of a country and that you do

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.400 
both sides of a country and that you do
travel<00:02:19.070> not<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.120> first-class<00:02:20.570> hotels<00:02:21.080> in

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
travel not just in first-class hotels in

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.080 
travel not just in first-class hotels in
air-conditioned<00:02:22.070> cars<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.910> do

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
air-conditioned cars but that you do

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.850 
air-conditioned cars but that you do
understand<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:23.690> people<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.230> get<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.740> get

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
understand that people you get you get

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.380 
understand that people you get you get
you<00:02:25.160> get<00:02:25.250> some<00:02:25.430> dirt<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.790> any<00:02:25.940> fingernails

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
you get some dirt to any fingernails

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.960 
you get some dirt to any fingernails
when<00:02:26.900> it's<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.380> incredibly<00:02:28.100> different<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
when it's so incredibly different to the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.760 
when it's so incredibly different to the
way<00:02:29.060> you've<00:02:29.239> been<00:02:29.270> brought<00:02:29.600> up<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.080> find<00:02:30.320> it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
way you've been brought up I find it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.809 
way you've been brought up I find it
it's<00:02:30.890> very<00:02:31.400> inspiring

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.879
