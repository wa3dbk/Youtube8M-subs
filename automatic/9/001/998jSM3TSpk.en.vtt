 dry with black blades practically already 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.409
 ended with white left a little bit and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.240
 I want to understand whether there will be more and then suddenly 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.049
 these here helmets factory qi 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 manage to post a little thumbnail 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.939
 such a zavravochka for us and here we have 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 such a carbon handle appeared in 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.950

 Sakayev's little letters are already carved on 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.070
 carbon shawls and dies along the contours 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.520
 similar to dry too suddenly it can 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.680
 appear and dry 30 will be unknown 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.670
 waiting at the end of August is kind of supposed to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.280
 to leave 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.950
 columbia river knife and tool 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 from designer hans arp marina serova 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.890
 a few new ones the first one is not 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.870
 such a small basket with that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.470
 by the way the bad selector about which I 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.899
 told quite recently the mechanism 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.800
 done about as before 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.920
 they have keys 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.530
 here are these money clips 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.830
 here are the same small legs with the same 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.930
 frame block and tremendous tremendous 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.209
 hole to hang on 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.180
 all sorts of carabiner keys and everything else 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.620
 there is such a small worth forty 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.739
 dollars and made completely all 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.660
 as far as I understood from 5 chrome 13 not 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.550
 the hardest steel to but rather 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.430
 unpretentious and 40 dollars for whom 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 Miller's feet this is in principle not 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.459
 many very such an interesting middling 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.459
 with a very stormy Seliger 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.920
 2 legs made roughly in alpine 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.709
 style so small fixed again with 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 such a series of shooting and plastic 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.720
 compact sheaths fix too from 5 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.760
 chrome 13 and from the same designer 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.220
 very interesting what exactly with all 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.830
 together with a sheath it can hang on 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.840
 climbing carabiner 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.519
 looks interesting our form factor is not 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.220
 of course is insane because 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.709
 pull out the legs this is opening the wallet 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.810
 we get the bag close to the show for now 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.650
 pull out leg stretch carbines 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.870
 curse him 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.670
 but no less such a knife is apparently 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.829
 because he was uncomfortable 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.120
 cheaper than not from it for 10 dollars 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.840
 whole it costs 30 dollars here and here on 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.120
 this video shows how convenient it is not convenient 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.910
 operate hang hang how 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.739
 Daily device trinket look at 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.780
 My legs are probably interesting as 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.570
 custom stuff as for me 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.470
 completely useless 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.049
 and here is the third useless thing from 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.740
 same design Hans Floren suggested 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.220
 still to us and here are these 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.130
 and below the pliers with blades also not 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.680
 too expensive and not some steel here is my 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.720
 view pliers must be so blown 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.360
 full-format laid out fold 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.860
 so when the pliers detail in the handle 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.780
 Knife my opinion thing absolutely 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.239
 useless here are such three new items 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.940
 for all that not one of them here with 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.750
 burning eyes run buy i would 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.520
 personally did not suddenly push do not forget 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.920
 subscribe to my youtube channel and 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.630
 search me on social networks hashtag bruce 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.310
 the proportion find their instagram its ends 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.050
 Components showed us another 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.690
 kraken line small small with 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.930
 white handles with titanium 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.930
 I liked the arms separately 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.460
 two pieces here for example with white 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:56.310
 the handle of the form of a mask wall is very tasty 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.490
 a very large large knife rejoices with such 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.280
 thunder truth interesting beautiful 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.980
 the thing would be in my hands I would take him a long time 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.890
 probably not released and the second is 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.780
 the spine I myself is not great therefore everything 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.510
 small knives I really like 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.790
 here on the palm for example photos of this 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.740
 Turk is right next to the lighter probably 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.450
 All the same, the lighter is big because 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.640
 against the palm we see that there 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.530
 adequate distance tristan 9 10 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.990
 centimeters on the blade but still 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.129
 considered a small compact bargen 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.309
 the smallest in this lineup 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:36.939
 and that's because its like he is gorgeous too 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:40.479
 exults over the race with lessar like everything and not and 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:42.819
 Here you can not think of a better here in the series 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.929
 go to anyone interested google 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:48.879
 see more pictures 

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:51.879
 Brazilian company is strong 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:54.489
 quite an interesting thing but all my life 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.339
 I thought they were doing some kind of gray 

00:05:54.489 --> 00:06:01.050
 sad knives like we used to flippers 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:03.429
 in titanium and with a white blade and all on it 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.369
 probably because more and more 

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:09.009
 in runet flashed photos from the Chinese 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:11.110
 sites where fake knives are sold 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.179
 They look like this and even now with 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.069
 such a wild dollar today 

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:18.909
 On Ali, you can buy this copy less 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:21.339
 six thousand rubles is your hell 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.169
 Vision these same Brazilians do 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.589
 absolutely crazy knives 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:29.529
 here you and nacre and Damascus go 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:32.110
 mascus and some crazy grindas 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.929
 it turns out the glacier is absolutely there on 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.029
 and the creator of these knives 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:41.139
 quite a famous brazil dude 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:44.559
 don gustavo makes these knives since 2004 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.300
 and in 2007, only three years engaged 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:48.339
 knives 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.959
 SÃ£o Paulo he already took first place as 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:54.719
 best maker over hanging brazil 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:55.990
 better not rzhavik all I would tamper in housing 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.619
 so here 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.839
 gtc is worth two and a half money 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:04.059
 thousands of dollars for them are far from 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.629
 the ceiling for us is now at 150 thousand 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:07.749
 rubles 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:11.409
 but my dear friends are feeling 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:11.860
 that this money they cost is really g 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:14.499
 d7 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.879
 not your original performance by anything 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:18.490
 not inferior to those expensive 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:21.550
 dorogusche knife which slips into 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:24.069
 Our videos I will write below link to

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.629

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:32.169
 modern art on the verge of high 

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:33.320
 technology and beautiful rich knife 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.180
 taste 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.160
 Alexey Ponomarev was with you again 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.680

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.870
 nice dress up 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:06.500
 aus 8a on the blade and black coating 

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:09.040
 therefore does not rust and do not glare here 

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.040
 such a little negro 

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.040
 African Americans
