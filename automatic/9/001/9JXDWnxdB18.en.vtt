about China overtaking America as a
world's<00:00:13.559> biggest<00:00:13.860> economy<00:00:14.000> does<00:00:15.000> size<00:00:15.299> matter

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
world's biggest economy does size matter

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.710 
world's biggest economy does size matter
indeed<00:00:16.529> well<00:00:17.400> let's<00:00:17.940> take<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> look<00:00:18.300> here

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
indeed well let's take a look here

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800 
indeed well let's take a look here
because<00:00:19.140> basically<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.640> article<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
because basically what the article is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.650 
because basically what the article is
referring<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.970> China<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.240> become

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
referring to is that China has become

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.740 
referring to is that China has become
the<00:00:25.140> number<00:00:26.039> one<00:00:26.070> economy<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> world<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the number one economy in the world and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
the number one economy in the world and
this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.380> something<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.949> been<00:00:29.189> saying

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
this is something that I've been saying

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.350 
this is something that I've been saying
a<00:00:30.000> couple<00:00:30.330> years<00:00:30.630> back<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.520> black

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
a couple years back because the black

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.540 
a couple years back because the black
market<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.899> China<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.680> huge<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.370> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
market in China is so huge and it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
market in China is so huge and it's
impossible<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> calculate<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> one

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
impossible to calculate so that is one

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
impossible to calculate so that is one
area<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:39.230> leads<00:00:40.230> us<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> believe<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.190> China

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
area that leads us to believe that China

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
area that leads us to believe that China
has<00:00:42.239> been<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> biggest<00:00:42.719> economy<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.530> least

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
has been the biggest economy at least

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.790 
has been the biggest economy at least
for<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> few<00:00:43.980> years<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:45.170> what<00:00:46.170> happened<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
for a few years now what happened is the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.660 
for a few years now what happened is the
IMF<00:00:47.190> adjusted<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.360> calculating<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.190> actual

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
IMF adjusted for calculating the actual

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
IMF adjusted for calculating the actual
purchasing<00:00:51.270> power<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.750> Chinese<00:00:52.440> compared<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
purchasing power of Chinese compared to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
purchasing power of Chinese compared to
their<00:00:53.340> Western<00:00:53.670> counterparts<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.960> they

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
their Western counterparts and when they

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
their Western counterparts and when they
put<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.070> new<00:00:56.309> adjustments<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.300> they

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
put in these new adjustments what they

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.869 
put in these new adjustments what they
found<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.930> China<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.739> taken<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.609> lead

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
found is that China as taken the lead

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
found is that China as taken the lead
and<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> course<00:01:01.770> Chinese

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and this is because of course Chinese

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.899 
and this is because of course Chinese
have<00:01:02.520> lower<00:01:02.760> overhead<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.899> less<00:01:04.170> taxes

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
have lower overhead they have less taxes

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.460 
have lower overhead they have less taxes
they<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.180> less<00:01:07.130> costs<00:01:08.130> than<00:01:08.479> their<00:01:10.700> same

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
they have less costs than their same

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.340 
they have less costs than their same
demographic<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.979> West<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.960> one<00:01:15.960> finance

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
demographic in the West so one finance

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.149 
demographic in the West so one finance
professor<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> pay<00:01:17.159> King<00:01:17.430> University<00:01:19.159> explains

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
professor I pay King University explains

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.450 
professor I pay King University explains
that<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.530> exactly<00:01:22.650> apples<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> apples

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that it's not exactly apples to apples

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.359 
that it's not exactly apples to apples
comparison<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.509> obviously<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
comparison because obviously one is a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.890 
comparison because obviously one is a
command<00:01:26.729> control<00:01:27.090> economy<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> other

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
command control economy and the other

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
command control economy and the other
one<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> basically<00:01:28.710> borrow<00:01:29.520> its<00:01:29.790> money

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
one has to basically borrow its money

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.100 
one has to basically borrow its money
from<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> Fed<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:32.090> China<00:01:33.090> has<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> ton<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> debt

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
from the Fed so China has a ton of debt

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.560 
from the Fed so China has a ton of debt
US<00:01:34.500> has<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> ton<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> debt<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.240> estimated

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
US has a ton of debt now it's estimated

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.850 
US has a ton of debt now it's estimated
here<00:01:37.460> by<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:40.049> bank<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> governors<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
here by the bank of governors of the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
here by the bank of governors of the
Federal<00:01:41.130> Reserve<00:01:41.400> System<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:42.170> US<00:01:43.170> debt<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
Federal Reserve System that US debt is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.630 
Federal Reserve System that US debt is
right<00:01:43.829> around<00:01:44.960> 60<00:01:45.960> trillion<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
right around 60 trillion or so but I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
right around 60 trillion or so but I
would<00:01:48.119> argue<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:49.259> closer

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
would argue that it is actually closer

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.499 
would argue that it is actually closer
to<00:01:49.680> 100<00:01:50.340> trillion<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> take<00:01:51.210> into

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to 100 trillion when you take into

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
to 100 trillion when you take into
account<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> unfunded<00:01:52.920> liabilities

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
account all the unfunded liabilities

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.639 
account all the unfunded liabilities
with<00:01:54.390> no<00:01:54.810> means<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.100> pay<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:57.149> off<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
with no means to pay them off as you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.800 
with no means to pay them off as you
know<00:02:00.140> employment<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.409> down<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.549> America<00:02:03.149> taxes

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
know employment is down in America taxes

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.859 
know employment is down in America taxes
or<00:02:03.960> higher<00:02:04.320> expenses<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.340> higher<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
or higher expenses are higher so how is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
or higher expenses are higher so how is
it<00:02:07.079> possible<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> pay<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> debt<00:02:08.489> now

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it possible to pay down that debt now

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.380 
it possible to pay down that debt now
what<00:02:09.119> China<00:02:09.420> does<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.649> calculate

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
what China does is they calculate

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.140 
what China does is they calculate
their<00:02:12.990> debt<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.860> different<00:02:14.280> way<00:02:14.430> they<00:02:14.700> assume

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
their debt a different way they assume

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.650 
their debt a different way they assume
that<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.960> paid<00:02:16.260> off<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.660> when

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
that it's going to be paid off so when

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.140 
that it's going to be paid off so when
they<00:02:18.780> calculate<00:02:19.230> GDP<00:02:19.440> their<00:02:20.310> debt<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.490> GDP

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

The Economist now what's more than

The Economist now what's more than
likely<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.320> China<00:02:56.130> will<00:02:56.310> go<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.700> route

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
decades and what it's going to try to do

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.520 
decades and what it's going to try to do
is<00:03:02.340> absorb<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.060> price<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.959> waste<00:03:04.200> into

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
is absorb the price of the waste into

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
write it off and that's that's scary

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.520

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
increasing reserve requirements and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.130 
increasing reserve requirements and
injecting<00:03:23.940> more<00:03:24.209> stimulus<00:03:24.690> into<00:03:24.989> their

injecting more stimulus into their

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.910 
injecting more stimulus into their
economy<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.510> China<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.660> getting<00:03:27.930> there<00:03:28.230> faster

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
when you compare it to growth so you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.449 
when you compare it to growth so you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
could say that the Chinese economy is

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.370 
could say that the Chinese economy is

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
several decades so we boat we know that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.630 
several decades so we boat we know that
both<00:03:53.310> nations<00:03:54.090> cook<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.810> books<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:56.310> we

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
both nations cook the books and if we

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.940 
both nations cook the books and if we
ever<00:03:56.760> got<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.360> glance<00:03:57.750> at<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.230> real<00:03:58.440> books<00:03:58.739> we

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
ever got a glance at the real books we

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.000 
ever got a glance at the real books we
would<00:03:59.100> find<00:03:59.400> that<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:01.049> problems<00:04:01.530> are<00:04:01.680> even

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
would find that the problems are even

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.500 
would find that the problems are even
deeper<00:04:02.370> than<00:04:02.400> what<00:04:03.120> we<00:04:03.269> know<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:05.510> basically

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
deeper than what we know so basically

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.770 
deeper than what we know so basically
that's<00:04:06.870> how<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.769> it<00:04:08.040> looks<00:04:08.310> bleak<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.000> it

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
that's how it is it looks bleak and it

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
that's how it is it looks bleak and it
looks<00:04:09.989> like<00:04:10.109> there's<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.859> be<00:04:11.130> continued

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
