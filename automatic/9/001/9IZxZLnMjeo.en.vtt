00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.559
 finished the short session as one of the most popular tunes of 2009 he received 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.749
 even an honorable mention among the best products words 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.639
 his successor the code played German occupier who serve 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.000
 It's all met to get started in the same way 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.359
 and that is astonishingly good image quality 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.439
 due to the rise of cameras smartphones, a bouquet of cameramen 2010 needs more 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.949
 can film nicely with that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.899
 the code pepertjes responds to the need 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.059
 it is a complete on camera with how many setting options vary 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.059
 from anti-glare to even creative filters 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.820
 and all that is full of a beautiful couple 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.230
 however, getting the most striking feature from Cyprus was the screen 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.640
 because it was set that also surrounded with a small but effective look like this 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.270
 this week at home ms 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.440
 went there 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.380
 and that it was strikingly good and fast there is only one but 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.750
 As stated, the code showed that they have a lot of setting options 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.590
 but you have to get rid of that ball and if I film a problem as a means I have it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.080
 but a very small piece of space left to really not see it anymore 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.700
 the rest is surrounded with 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.270
 mertens 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.100
 and then that is possibilities there are for example creative filters in total 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.810
 four noticed the normal position of jens van der black and white up to seven years 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 to even color from the seventies vpk 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.780
 but that always looks just as cheerful 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.659
 I think soon as I am just as good that I am going across the street 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.730
 put in zeebrugge for connecting to a headset or an accident and what 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.010
 Then mine accidents is handy that you can determine nutrition and robin of something 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.120
 increase or decrease 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.230
 also towards image stabilization and standard face recognition 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.390
 I could also have added a special anti-glare 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 against those who can easily film themselves in the bright sun 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.210
 but the practice is a bit disappointing when the black and white use pink 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.160
 nothing of true and totally not functioning 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.290
 also adds sheriff to the city 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
 creating on the photo or film is directly indicated 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.630
 where they should be without the moment you put the camera in cups of tea 4 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.179
 June 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.179
 You may want to specify residents yourself because there are 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.559
 then an image quality the code showed that can be filmed in full hd 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.869
 at 1080p is in the third film festival 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.979
 certainly dark conditions I made some movies in the evening you notice 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.039
 that the amount of noise is a lot less than the other side cameras 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.339
 really played at its best and I am very enthusiastic about it 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:35.040
 also wants to support seed system improved and photos to look sure when 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.049
 Make use of 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.609
 make a special advance along it pretty well out of the can 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.259
 a fact 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.109
 yes but no light is on 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.579
 A piece of honor code continued to connect to your LCD plasma television using 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.419
 an HDMI cable and those results that looks very nice 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.519
 for that matter this camera is definitely recommended the point is only passive 1200 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.289
 euro then you can ask is it worth it compared to the cameras 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:04.409
 of which he must ever set up 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.069
 i would say yes the image quality is just way too much better 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.969
 count on the accidental connection and you have a win win 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:12.969
 situation
