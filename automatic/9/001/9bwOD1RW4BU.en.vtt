bit<00:01:39.439> more<00:01:39.649> paperwork<00:01:40.159> on<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.399> left-hand<00:01:40.819> side

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
bit more paperwork on the left-hand side

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.389 
bit more paperwork on the left-hand side
now<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.479> is<00:01:41.719> not<00:01:42.350> exactly<00:01:42.829> a<00:01:42.920> full-featured

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
now this is not exactly a full-featured

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.730 
now this is not exactly a full-featured
manual<00:01:43.999> just<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.240> couple<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.630> pages<00:01:44.899> here<00:01:45.319> in

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
inch guitar connector into a USB that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.800 
inch guitar connector into a USB that
your<00:02:46.220> console<00:02:46.849> can<00:02:47.060> understand<00:02:47.569> there's<00:02:47.780> a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
your console can understand there's a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.080 
your console can understand there's a
little<00:02:48.019> module<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.580> line<00:02:49.790> there<00:02:50.000> it's

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
little module in in the line there it's

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.670 
little module in in the line there it's
a<00:02:50.150> pretty<00:02:50.330> long<00:02:50.569> cable<00:02:50.959> I'd<00:02:51.049> say<00:02:51.200> about<00:02:51.380> ten

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
a pretty long cable I'd say about ten

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.740 
a pretty long cable I'd say about ten
feet<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.790> could<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> little<00:02:53.329> distance

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
feet so you could be a little distance

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.990 
feet so you could be a little distance
from<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.989> console<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.590> still<00:02:54.829> rock<00:02:55.519> on<00:02:55.760> if

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
from the console and still rock on if

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.850 
from the console and still rock on if
