00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
well I'm fishing the ex rap jointed at

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.580 
well I'm fishing the ex rap jointed at
the<00:00:06.870> moment<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.540> none<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.750> favorite<00:00:10.350> moves

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.270 
the moment and none of my favorite moves
for<00:00:10.799> these<00:00:10.920> gravel<00:00:11.280> pits<00:00:11.520> and<00:00:12.480> first<00:00:12.930> cast

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
for these gravel pits and first cast

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.760 
for these gravel pits and first cast
I've<00:00:14.280> had<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.520> Pike<00:00:14.789> take<00:00:15.119> it<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.539> it's<00:00:16.379> all

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I've had a Pike take it but it's all

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
I've had a Pike take it but it's all
wait<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> come<00:00:17.220> off<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:17.610> quite<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> small

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
wait to come off it was quite a small

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.439 
wait to come off it was quite a small
one<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:19.110> he<00:00:19.349> was<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> little<00:00:19.619> bit

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
one I think he was a little bit

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.150 
one I think he was a little bit
over-ambitious<00:00:21.449> trying<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.170> take<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.710> load<00:00:23.039> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
over-ambitious trying to take a load of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.659 
over-ambitious trying to take a load of
that<00:00:23.310> size<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.929> in<00:00:24.929> the<00:00:25.050> spring<00:00:25.349> a<00:00:25.740> small<00:00:26.400> pike

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
that size but in the spring a small pike

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.749 
that size but in the spring a small pike
will<00:00:26.880> take<00:00:27.269> quite<00:00:27.480> big<00:00:27.750> baits<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:29.609> never

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
will take quite big baits and you never

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.489 
will take quite big baits and you never
know<00:00:29.910> what's<00:00:30.089> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> next<00:00:30.839> it

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
know what's going to take it next it

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.460 
know what's going to take it next it
could<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> jack<00:00:32.040> or<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.490> big<00:00:32.730> fish<00:00:33.470> but

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
could be a jack or a really big fish but

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.940 
could be a jack or a really big fish but
the<00:00:34.680> X<00:00:34.800> trap<00:00:35.010> jointed<00:00:35.520> has<00:00:35.670> become<00:00:36.950> quite

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the X trap jointed has become quite

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
the X trap jointed has become quite
popular<00:00:38.220> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> last<00:00:38.760> few<00:00:39.000> years<00:00:39.240> when<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
popular in the last few years when I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
popular in the last few years when I
first<00:00:40.290> saw<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.310> couple<00:00:41.490> of<00:00:41.610> years<00:00:41.760> ago<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
first saw them a couple of years ago I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
first saw them a couple of years ago I
didn't<00:00:43.200> realize<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.520> benefit<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.060> them

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
didn't realize just the benefit of them

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.500 
didn't realize just the benefit of them
but<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.900> can<00:00:46.080> crank<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:48.360> can

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but you can crank them down and you can

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
but you can crank them down and you can
make<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.840> suspend<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> I'll<00:00:49.650> suspend<00:00:49.890> for

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
make them suspend and I'll suspend for

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
make them suspend and I'll suspend for
quite<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> time<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:51.630> as<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> water<00:00:52.050> gets

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
quite a time and as the water gets

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.320 
quite a time and as the water gets
colder<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:52.860> quite<00:00:53.100> important<00:00:53.640> because

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
colder that's quite important because

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.960 
colder that's quite important because
the<00:00:54.660> ler<00:00:54.810> stays<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.160> strike<00:00:56.430> zone<00:00:56.460> for

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
the ler stays in the strike zone for

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.710 
the ler stays in the strike zone for
much<00:00:57.090> longer

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
much longer

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.630 
much longer
but<00:00:58.380> I'm<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> persevere<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> one

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
but I'm going to persevere with this one

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.840 
but I'm going to persevere with this one
and<00:01:00.410> just<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.130> I<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.340> pick<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.580> a<00:01:02.700> be<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and just see if I can pick up a be a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:41.620 
and just see if I can pick up a be a
pike<00:01:03.150> on<00:01:03.360> it

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.480 

well<00:01:42.630> Phil<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.080> ones<00:01:43.260> hit<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.620> X<00:01:43.770> rap<00:01:44.010> jointed

using when the waters cold and all the
times<00:02:38.850> when<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> Fisher<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.540> each<00:02:39.660> shine<00:02:39.959> as<00:02:40.650> I

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
times when the Fisher of each shine as I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.790 
times when the Fisher of each shine as I
say<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.700> crank<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.239> down<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:43.709> will

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
say you can crank it down it will

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.380 
say you can crank it down it will
suspend<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.579> while<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.269> was

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
suspend for a while and then it was

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
suspend for a while and then it was
rised<00:02:45.780> very<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:46.440> slowly<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> surface

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
rised very very slowly to the surface

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.580 
rised very very slowly to the surface
and<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:47.970> means<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> strike<00:02:49.530> zone

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and that means it's in the strike zone

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.470 
and that means it's in the strike zone
for<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.220> long<00:02:50.430> time<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.000> gives<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.269> pike

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
for a long time and it gives the pike

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.650 
for a long time and it gives the pike
time<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.049> make<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.350> mines<00:02:52.560> up<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:54.209> that's<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
time to make the mines up so that's the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.789 
time to make the mines up so that's the
X<00:02:54.780> trap<00:02:55.049> jointed<00:02:57.110> I'll<00:02:58.110> keep<00:02:58.320> saying<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.709> but

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
X trap jointed I'll keep saying it but

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.140 
X trap jointed I'll keep saying it but
it's<00:02:58.920> another<00:02:59.010> one<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.489> favorites<00:03:00.000> it's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150

it's another one of my favorites it's
become<00:03:00.450> one<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.660> my<00:03:00.810> favorites<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.410> one<00:03:01.920> I'll

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
