make sure you jump right there a little

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.830 
make sure you jump right there a little
bit<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.060> can<00:03:07.120> get<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.269> little<00:03:07.360> bit<00:03:07.569> of<00:03:07.660> distance

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
bit you can get a little bit of distance

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.750 
bit you can get a little bit of distance
on<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.230> then<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.040> come<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.370> here<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.610> junk

on it then just come out here and junk

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.979 
on it then just come out here and junk
you're<00:03:09.910> probably<00:03:10.060> going<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.299> get<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.570> animus
