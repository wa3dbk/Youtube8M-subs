00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.960
 in this period of crisis they sell themselves 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 less and less cars only one brand in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 bucking the most expensive the most 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.720
 scope 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.720
 what's behind the engine of a ferrari 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.690
 campus of maranello province of modena 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.550
 there is no other place in which the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.040
 concept of made in italy you find one 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.500
 the most effective representation of ferrari 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.150
 it is no longer a brand, it is a symbol that 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.640
 in recent years he has lived one 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.559
 non-stop commercial growth i 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.390
 reasons are closely related to 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.090
 type of offer and the evolution of 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.610
 the automotive companies market today 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.070
 they survive only in two ways if they offer 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.900
 affordable or high products 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.180
 quality and the vicissitudes of the 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.909
 ferrario tell a lot of history 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.030
 the Italian car is always the ferrari 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.640
 was a car built for 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.720
 exclusivity because every ferrari 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.930
 different from the classrooms 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.740
 in addition, customers order their machines 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.970
 that is custom made 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.970
 car for them 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.299
 the history of the brand begins in 1939 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.270
 when enzo ferrari founds a company 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.060
 call aviation car construction yes 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.280
 initially occupies is only in one 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.930
 second time the owner of the house yes 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.780
 dedicates to his great passion 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.290
 the racing cars are the myth of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.290
 trento 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 his stable initially treated 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.690
 pilots of various machines but became 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 soon part of the alpha racing team 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 romeo 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 only after leaving the alpha ferrari 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.510
 he started producing cars for his own 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.430
 bill 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.810
 the victories and the quality of the cars 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.760
 drag sales and white life 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.400
 salary and multi-faceted beginning a 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.300
 run from 1947 with a car 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.360
 all his 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.630
 he faced all the other houses 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 automobiles alone from this 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.130
 small provincial town and had 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.870
 great genius great successes 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.820
 of enzo ferrari was that of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.920
 guess that instead the passion for 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.959
 the car for the races for a small one 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.600
 constructor would have represented one 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.950
 niche almost unique and therefore ferrari 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.170
 he begins to be an automobile priest 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910
 extraordinary and while everyone is doing the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.400
 Schumi mass motorization yes 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.100
 focuses on the cars they took 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.720
 from the races the technical cues for 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.720
 be taken on street cars 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.210
 a few years later the history of the brand 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.760
 merges with that of fiat e 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.890
 indirectly with turin the real 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.120
 Enzo's passion is not racing 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.770
 sell cars 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.460
 but the races become more and more 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.680
 competitive and need investments now 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.620
 unsustainable for the Emilian factory 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.420
 the company is in crisis I think it needs 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.830
 a partner who supports him in sales 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.300
 of series cars 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.300
 and he will find it right in fiat 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.340
 therefore ferrari had tried a 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.470
 approach with valley that was then 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.800
 president of the bee to a not valley 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.120
 had shown signs of membership was the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.760
 young lawyer lambs he didn't have 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.920
 still the role he would have had then and 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.410
 ferrari managed to make a first agreement 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.990
 with the fiat getting financed 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.990
 six-cylinder dinho engine engines that 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.660
 they were used both for the cars 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.020
 ferrari for fiat dino when 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.130
 giovanni agnelli became president 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.320
 an agreement was immediately made which 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.010
 the fiat gave the guarantee of an entry 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.290
 with 50 percent of the shares with the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.020
 possibility of the fiat to acquire 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.370
 90 percent when enzo ferrari 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.790
 he was dead what actually 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.260
 it happened with mixed results because 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.540
 with the transition to fiat la 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.700
 technology transfusion from tracks to 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.100
 models for the market he had 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.970
 characterized the first ferrari marks 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.970
 a setback 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.560
 how the company comes out only later a 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.750
 since the late 90's when 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.030
 a production system develops which 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.620
 takes back the glorious past 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.880
 company and production cars 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.920
 they reflect to the smallest details 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.990
 those of the formula 1 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.240
 a winning strategy that opened the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.130
 there is nothing better than the market 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.200
 ran where you have to do the maximum for 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.810
 have the best performance for 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.910
 experiment with innovations the change 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.310
 type formula 1 that for example with the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.960
 levers behind the steering wheel that is now 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.940
 is spreading about every kind of 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200
 automobile was born from ferrari to nel 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.330
 born of racing 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.860
 and this is just one of the events there 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.860
 ferrari touches its historical record 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.110
 just in full economic crisis 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.910
 selling almost 20 percent in 2011 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.900
 more than the average of the years 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.090
 precedents while the car market 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.130
 for the middle class it carries the niche 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.770
 of the super luxury comes more and more 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.610
 a ferrari of the latest generation can 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.870
 cost more than 300 thousand euros money 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.820
 mainly foreign because the market 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.820
 internal and almost non-existent 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.500
 a slice of the market that must be satisfied 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.990
 each of these machines is a piece 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.830
 unique made to measure but in the process 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.930
 productive 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.020
 what is the moment that marks the success 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.300
 of a model probably the design 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.150
 of the line the design of a prototype 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.660
 develops through various stages from the 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.410
 pencil in the wind tunnel a 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.419
 maranello 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.060
 there are three but a special model 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.190
 one of the many concept cars developed on 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.560
 ferrari bases is tested in the 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.740
 spire gallery where we assist in 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.110
 exclusive to some tests how it works 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.110
 a wind tunnel and what it is used for 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.690
 the wind tunnel is a plant that 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.530
 allows to simulate in the laboratory 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.750
 what are the conditions that a 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.090
 vehicle meets when it moves into 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.330
 road in the wind tunnel then the 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.389
 laboratory it is possible to determine the 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.660
 forces acting on the vehicle and the 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.240
 aerodynamic field in which this 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.949
 vehicle moves the wind in the tunnel 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.680
 it is produced using a propeller 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.479
 main and an arc of other 13 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.229
 propellers that are located outside the 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.229
 test chamber 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.960
 the speed can reach up to 250 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.790
 kilometers per hour 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.680
 the carpet under the car moves 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.570
 at the same wind speed e 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.990
 allows you to simulate the path up 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.990
 Street 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.640
 the machine is anchored to the ground with 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.890
 of the supports connected to a scale 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.310
 which allows to register the forces that 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.900
 act on the car like many 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.340
 models related to the parent company 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.320
 this is a car with one 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.710
 unique feature does not have the 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.710
 windscreen 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.020
 or rather to a virtual windshield in 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.120
 Practice the hood and draw it so 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.880
 such as to divert the air flow over 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.430
 the passengers' heads a jewel of 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.380
 effective automotive engineering already 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.380
 between 50 mph up
