turn<00:00:08.940> up<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.090> distortion<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.099> go

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.029 

man<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:21.900> doing<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.230> two<00:00:22.410> finger<00:00:22.619> power

man I'm just doing a two finger power

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
man I'm just doing a two finger power
cord<00:00:23.400> because<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.510> 90s<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.349> we<00:00:25.619> turn<00:00:25.800> up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
cord because it's the 90s and we turn up

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.819 
cord because it's the 90s and we turn up
our<00:00:26.009> distortion<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.680> sure

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
our distortion and you can make sure

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.130 
our distortion and you can make sure
that<00:00:29.099> your<00:00:29.310> pickup<00:00:30.000> switches<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> way

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that your pickup switches all the way

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.520 
that your pickup switches all the way
down<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:32.489> using<00:00:33.199> we're<00:00:34.199> using<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
down so we're using we're using this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.600 
down so we're using we're using this
bridge<00:00:34.860> pickup

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
bridge pickup

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
bridge pickup
that<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:39.080> when<00:00:40.080> you<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.379> those

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that way we can when you get all those

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
that way we can when you get all those
sweet<00:00:40.830> harmonics<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:43.820> we<00:00:44.820> ran<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
sweet harmonics in there so we ran a and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
sweet harmonics in there so we ran a and
I'm<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.780> doing<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> power<00:00:46.230> cord<00:00:46.470> at<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.680> which

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I'm just doing a power cord at a which

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
I'm just doing a power cord at a which
is<00:00:47.160> five<00:00:47.430> seven<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:49.160> I'm<00:00:50.160> sliding<00:00:50.820> from<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.960> G

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
is five seven and I'm sliding from the G

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.880 
is five seven and I'm sliding from the G
chord<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.799> is<00:00:52.830> a<00:00:52.949> three<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> five<00:00:54.119> and<00:00:57.890> then

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
chord which is a three and five and then

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.460 
chord which is a three and five and then
I<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.339> few<00:00:59.640> exes

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.390 

gee<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:08.610> F<00:01:08.790> sharp<00:01:09.590> its<00:01:10.590> 244<00:01:11.190> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
gee then I go to F sharp its 244 and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.429 
gee then I go to F sharp its 244 and
back<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.330> G<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.870> then<00:01:13.320> repeat

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.309 

and<00:01:18.979> I'm<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:19.249> keeping<00:01:19.549> my<00:01:19.579> strumming

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
and I'm just keeping my strumming

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.169 
and I'm just keeping my strumming
constant<00:01:21.319> and<00:01:21.499> the<00:01:22.069> fact<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.549> I'm<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:22.759> kind

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
constant and the fact that I'm just kind

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.520 
constant and the fact that I'm just kind
of<00:01:23.270> lifting<00:01:23.539> up<00:01:23.659> keeping<00:01:23.899> my<00:01:23.990> fingers<00:01:24.350> there

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
of lifting up keeping my fingers there

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.380 
of lifting up keeping my fingers there
before<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:24.979> press<00:01:25.429> down<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.850> cord<00:01:26.060> it

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
before I press down on the cord it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.999 
before I press down on the cord it
actually<00:01:26.659> gets<00:01:26.840> those<00:01:26.929> harmonics<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.710> between

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
actually gets those harmonics in between

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:38.240 
actually gets those harmonics in between
so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 

chill<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.480> ensemble<00:01:40.260> he<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.740> become

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
chill I'm ensemble he will become

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.460 
chill I'm ensemble he will become
alright<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> keep<00:01:42.420> doing<00:01:42.570> this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.300 

brings<00:01:48.470> us<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.920> chorus

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.560 

so<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:57.060> base<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.900> open<00:01:58.409> opening

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
so the base of it is just open opening

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.040 
so the base of it is just open opening
fourth<00:02:01.260> fret<00:02:02.060> second<00:02:03.060> fret<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
fourth fret second fret back to the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.230 
fourth fret second fret back to the
fourth<00:02:04.290> fret<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.010> open<00:02:05.400> there's<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> bar

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
fourth fret then open there's that bar

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:17.920 
fourth fret then open there's that bar
chords<00:02:06.510> on<00:02:06.600> there

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.130 

okay<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.310> chorus<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.720> song

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
okay so that is the chorus for the song

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.050 
okay so that is the chorus for the song
and<00:02:22.170> then<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.739> for<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.730> on

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and then we go and it's just for for on

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.490 
and then we go and it's just for for on
the<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.049> string<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.680> D<00:02:32.010> string<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:34.170> down<00:02:34.319> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the a string and D string going down to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.500 
the a string and D string going down to
the<00:02:34.590> two

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.520 

but<00:02:39.510> then<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.810> add<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:39.990> lot<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.320> sweet

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
but then you add a lot of sweet

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.970 
but then you add a lot of sweet
harmonics

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.510 

okay<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.349> last<00:02:51.560> part<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:52.010> we're<00:02:52.400> on

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
okay and then the last part is we're on

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.160 
okay and then the last part is we're on
E

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.500 

okay<00:02:56.010> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.760 

I'm<00:03:02.080> just<00:03:02.349> hitting<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.620> E

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
I'm just hitting on E

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.050 
I'm just hitting on E
then<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.790> three<00:03:06.300> four<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.850> one

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
then I'm going to three four all in one

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.930 
then I'm going to three four all in one
pick

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.020 

and<00:03:14.030> then<00:03:14.600> on<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.780> E<00:03:14.810> chord<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.710> do<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.340> so

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
and then on the E chord I can do this so

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.400 
and then on the E chord I can do this so
it's<00:03:17.180> open<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.780> two

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.080 

and<00:03:23.920> these<00:03:24.160> fingers<00:03:24.430> are<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.820> kind<00:03:25.000> of

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
and these fingers are just kind of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.490 
and these fingers are just kind of
stopping<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.540> e-string<00:03:25.690> from<00:03:26.080> ringing<00:03:26.320> out

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
stopping the e-string from ringing out

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:41.290 
stopping the e-string from ringing out
too<00:03:26.650> much<00:03:26.800> then<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:27.580> cool<00:03:27.790> harmonics

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.900 

all<00:03:42.110> right<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:43.190> only<00:03:43.310> other<00:03:43.490> part<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.820> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
all right so the only other part of the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.830 
all right so the only other part of the
song<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.890> bridge<00:03:45.890> which<00:03:46.520> is<00:03:46.700> keep<00:03:47.390> my<00:03:47.630> feet

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
song is the bridge which is keep my feet
