00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
dump it into the jar now you don't have

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.950 
dump it into the jar now you don't have
to<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:43.910> in<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.120> kitchen<00:00:44.269> you<00:00:44.510> can<00:00:44.570> do<00:00:44.840> it

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
to do this in the kitchen you can do it

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.290 
to do this in the kitchen you can do it
outside<00:00:45.250> but<00:00:46.250> we're<00:00:46.640> doing<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.059> in<00:00:47.239> the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
outside but we're doing this in the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.790 
outside but we're doing this in the
middle<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.600> winter<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:48.469> we're<00:00:48.590> growing

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
middle of winter and so we're growing

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.799 
middle of winter and so we're growing
everything<00:00:49.039> inside<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:50.149> then<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:50.359> take<00:00:50.539> cool

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
everything inside and then you take cool

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.590 
everything inside and then you take cool
water<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:52.129> you're<00:00:52.969> going<00:00:53.089> to<00:00:53.120> fill<00:00:53.329> up<00:00:53.449> your

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
water and you're going to fill up your

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.160 
water and you're going to fill up your
jar<00:00:53.839> and<00:00:54.760> swirl<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.089> rinse<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.749> seed

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
jar and swirl and rinse that seed

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.079 
jar and swirl and rinse that seed
because<00:00:57.649> even<00:00:57.949> though<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:58.190> seed<00:00:58.399> is<00:00:58.519> organic

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
because even though the seed is organic

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.259 
because even though the seed is organic
and<00:00:59.719> it's<00:00:59.870> clean<00:01:00.230> like<00:01:01.129> to<00:01:01.309> rinse<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:02.059> get

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
and it's clean like to rinse it and get

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.600 
and it's clean like to rinse it and get
as<00:01:02.390> much<00:01:02.539> dust<00:01:02.809> off<00:01:03.079> as<00:01:03.289> possible<00:01:03.890> then<00:01:04.460> I've

as much dust off as possible then I've

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.750

times<00:02:14.140> after<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.500> third<00:02:15.770> rinse<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.700> will<00:02:16.820> look

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
times after the third rinse it will look

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.820 
times after the third rinse it will look
like<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.360> there's<00:02:17.840> little<00:02:18.110> tail<00:02:18.320> starting

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
like this there's little tail starting

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.570 
like this there's little tail starting
on<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.190> sprouts<00:02:21.190> they've<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.430> about

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
on the sprouts they've just about

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.830 
on the sprouts they've just about
doubled<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.209> size

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
doubled in size

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.990 
doubled in size
they've<00:02:24.050> swollen<00:02:24.530> up<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.890> you've<00:02:25.610> got<00:02:25.790> twice

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
they've swollen up and you've got twice

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.900 
they've swollen up and you've got twice
as<00:02:26.209> much<00:02:26.360> wheat<00:02:26.600> as<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.870> had<00:02:26.990> before<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.730> next

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
as much wheat as you had before the next

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.940 
as much wheat as you had before the next
step<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:30.050> back<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> planting

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
step now is going back to the planting

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.420 
step now is going back to the planting
table

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
now that you've soaked your seed you've

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.770 
now that you've soaked your seed you've
sprouted<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:34.400> time<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.730> plant<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.180> you'll

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
sprouted it it's time to plant it you'll

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.810 
sprouted it it's time to plant it you'll
take<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> two<00:02:36.560> fighting<00:02:37.010> trays<00:02:37.280> with

to press the seed down into the soil the

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.029 
to press the seed down into the soil the
better<00:04:30.599> you<00:04:30.720> press<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.860> better

better you press it in the better
contact<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:33.449> wheat<00:04:33.659> will<00:04:33.900> have<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:35.069> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
contact the wheat will have with the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.210 
contact the wheat will have with the
soil<00:04:35.550> which<00:04:36.270> will<00:04:36.509> help<00:04:36.659> it<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.930> continue<00:04:37.919> to

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
soil which will help it to continue to

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.330 
soil which will help it to continue to
germinate<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.599> grow<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.919> now<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.129> it's

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
germinate and to grow so now that it's

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.550 
germinate and to grow so now that it's
packed<00:04:41.550> down<00:04:41.819> we're<00:04:42.750> gonna<00:04:42.870> give<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.259> little

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
packed down we're gonna give it a little

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.219 
packed down we're gonna give it a little
more<00:04:43.800> water<00:04:44.240> just<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.479> wet<00:04:45.659> the<00:04:45.780> top<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.169> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
more water just to wet the top of the

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.899 
more water just to wet the top of the
seed<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:51.440> then<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.560> next<00:04:52.830> step<00:04:53.039> is<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:53.879> need

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
seed and then the next step is we need

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.369 
seed and then the next step is we need
to<00:04:54.150> cover<00:04:55.490> key<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.669> get<00:04:56.849> good<00:04:57.389> wheat<00:04:57.569> grass<00:04:57.810> is

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
to cover key to get good wheat grass is

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.080 
to cover key to get good wheat grass is
at<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.800> beginning<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.430> need<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.699> start<00:05:00.000> it

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
at the beginning you need to start it

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.180 
at the beginning you need to start it
properly<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.840> keep<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.229> down<00:05:01.440> we're<00:05:02.129> gonna

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
properly so to keep it down we're gonna

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.260 
properly so to keep it down we're gonna
take<00:05:02.520> some<00:05:02.729> newspaper<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:04.770> I've<00:05:04.860> got<00:05:05.039> this
