save<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.900> environment<00:02:30.139> well<00:02:31.130> let's<00:02:31.730> find<00:02:32.000> out

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.330 

first<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.540> all<00:02:35.660> check<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.350> out<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:40.160> hear

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
first of all check this out you hear

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.699 
first of all check this out you hear
that<00:02:41.260> that's<00:02:42.260> right

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
that that's right

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.090 
that that's right
nothing<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:44.269> starts<00:02:45.109> using<00:02:45.440> electric<00:02:45.889> motor

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
nothing it starts using electric motor

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.960 
nothing it starts using electric motor
first<00:02:46.430> hence<00:02:47.329> there's<00:02:47.959> no<00:02:48.440> sound<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:49.609> takes<00:02:49.850> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
first hence there's no sound it takes a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.849 
first hence there's no sound it takes a
bit<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.120> time<00:02:50.269> for<00:02:50.600> one<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.750> get<00:02:50.989> used<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.319> but

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
bit of time for one to get used to but

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.629 
bit of time for one to get used to but
for<00:02:52.100> me<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:52.940> unnerving<00:02:53.829> see<00:02:54.829> I'm<00:02:55.069> pressing

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
for me it's unnerving see I'm pressing

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.970 
for me it's unnerving see I'm pressing
on<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> accelerator<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.930> doesn't<00:02:57.590> make<00:02:57.650> any

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980

on the accelerator and doesn't make any
sound<00:02:58.400> before<00:02:59.359> I<00:02:59.569> get<00:02:59.720> going<00:02:59.750> let's<00:03:00.350> reset<00:03:00.889> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
sound before I get going let's reset the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.160 
sound before I get going let's reset the
odometer<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.120> we'll<00:03:02.299> know<00:03:02.480> how<00:03:02.660> much<00:03:02.870> fuel<00:03:03.109> we

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
odometer so we'll know how much fuel we

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.470 
odometer so we'll know how much fuel we
have<00:03:03.319> burned<00:03:03.709> at<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.220> end<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.609> our<00:03:04.730> trip

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.080 

now<00:05:30.960> let's<00:05:31.260> see<00:05:31.470> how<00:05:31.800> much<00:05:32.010> fuel<00:05:32.370> i've<00:05:32.700> burned

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
now let's see how much fuel i've burned

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.400 
now let's see how much fuel i've burned
after<00:05:34.850> hmm<00:05:35.850> one<00:05:36.540> hundred<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:36.930> fifteen

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410

kilometers

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.570 

okay<00:05:46.630> it's<00:05:47.530> about<00:05:47.830> seven<00:05:48.730> liters<00:05:49.090> for<00:05:50.580> 115

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
okay it's about seven liters for 115

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.830 
okay it's about seven liters for 115
