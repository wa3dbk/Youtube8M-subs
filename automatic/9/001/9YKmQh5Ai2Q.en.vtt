00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
almost like an isometric thing kind of

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.580 
almost like an isometric thing kind of
no<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.450> much<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:52.079> your<00:02:52.230> arm<00:02:52.379> is

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
no not so much because your arm is

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.710 
no not so much because your arm is
actually<00:02:52.769> moving<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.639> it's<00:02:53.819> not<00:02:53.970> isometric

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
actually moving so it's not isometric

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.960 
actually moving so it's not isometric
