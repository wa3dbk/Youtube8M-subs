my<00:00:41.960> makeshift<00:00:44.379> melter<00:00:45.379> I<00:00:45.440> guess<00:00:46.059> basically<00:00:47.059> it

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
my makeshift melter I guess basically it

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.410 
my makeshift melter I guess basically it
got<00:00:47.600> colder<00:00:48.109> inside<00:00:48.309> got<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> excellent<00:00:50.149> old

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
got colder inside got a excellent old

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.450 
got colder inside got a excellent old
pot<00:00:50.749> that<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:51.109> cut<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.440> around<00:00:51.499> helped<00:00:52.039> keep<00:00:52.249> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
pot that I cut it around helped keep the

it didn't catch fire at all which I'm
not<00:03:58.390> sure<00:03:58.570> if<00:03:58.630> that's<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:58.870> cuz<00:03:59.140> it's<00:03:59.290> the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
not sure if that's just cuz it's the

okay we're gonna try to pour it into a
piece<00:04:12.610> of<00:04:12.640> metal<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.120> see<00:04:13.270> if<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.480> still<00:04:13.690> turns

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
piece of metal and see if it still turns

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:25.890 
piece of metal and see if it still turns
out<00:04:14.140> all<00:04:14.440> black<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:23.940> we're<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:25.150> smoothly<00:04:25.510> it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
out all black and we're so smoothly it

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.540

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
that was easy that it I really kind of

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.810 
that was easy that it I really kind of
expected<00:06:05.009> it<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.400> be<00:06:05.490> stuck
