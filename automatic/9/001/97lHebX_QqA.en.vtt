 furyk or mola villeta moneta 5 I come to 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.080
 bring a new news and it's that I 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.910
 you are asking on twitter for 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.679

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.749

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.829
 asking furyk has disappeared me 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.439
 police clothes 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.910
 rockstar is a lawyer or they ask me 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.859
 fury because I do not already have my clothes 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.750
 still police and trash clothes then 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.640
 well just what is happening is 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.839
 that rockstar has patched it 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.310
 they have simply got into the 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.029
 servers or have the files gotten 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.430
 of the game and they have cut it off by 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.230
 the online mode is worth we can simply 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.700
 have it in bank robberies that already 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 they know we can dress like police 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.510
 but before before after a 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.760
 tutorial or a trick how you want 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.469
 call him on how to have these clothes in mode 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.820
 online give it now not now 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.090
 simply if we go to clothing 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.890
 saved will appear without articles 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.260
 so then I want you to tell me 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.699
 If you think a hundred articles appear with 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.590
 articles tell me in the comments 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.539
 if you have disappeared or 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.730
 you still have it but as I'm seeing 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.920
 in edit clothes saved to me 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.019
 I appear empty and I do not appear 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.560
 police clothes or trash garbage 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.720
 I had previously 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.009
 then they apparently removed it from us 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.899
 simply what has gotten into the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.759
 servers or the game files and what 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.470
 have removed for online mode if what 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.939
 you still have hope that you put it on 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.890
 because if you put it on 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.530
 possibly you can keep it 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.060
 then we say it is worth that this is the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.220
 first news and now I come to bring 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.649
 another news and it is that you already know that it came out 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.720
 7 to 5 for pc and I started to go very 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.670
 file is good so they have brought some 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.490
 hackers who have found textures of 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.950
 new super gt which is a gta vehicle 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.690
 4 I do not want you to be wrong with the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.319
 rapid 7 that already manufactures a vehicle 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.209
 gta 5 in gta 5 is the rapid gt but the 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.360
 PC textures in the game files 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.770
 of gta 5 on pc appears the super gt vale 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.200
 as having on screen this 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.670
 vehicle that appears on playstation 4 in 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.729
 but it appears in the previous consoles 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.119
 is worth the speed and 7 but the one that appears in 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.039
 screen is the super gt that is from gta 4 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.799
 Well, now they may bring it 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.280
 improved people to 5 in the law in 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.560
 holguin and in pc it is worth but you 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.000
 you will say fury we are reached from 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.200
 these vehicles we want new vehicle 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.270
 we want 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.650
 we want good the truth how to see craft 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.959
 I would molar quite as I said 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.190
 asking fury what things you would like or 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.709
 what vehicle would you like that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.190
 Well, I would like the jetpack 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.900
 like everybody to be able to fly by 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.099
 the city but who knows where 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.319
 find or do not know where 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.599
 find because there's a lot of mystery there 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.860
 many odds a lot of people say 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.110
 that here it may be but we do not know 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.700
 where it is or if they are going to 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.170

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.209
