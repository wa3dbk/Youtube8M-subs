00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 this did not lose the fundamental order 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 but there is also one on the court 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 He perceives that what happened there is superior 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.110
 an angel and a deconcentration mark 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.110
 the next lateral 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.520
 but knowing you superior knowing that 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.910
 the goal was going to fall this key point is 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.910
 that after 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.610
 you have to see the edition already the most 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.610
 tranquility but a marker 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.820
 4 anyway from you but 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.750
 we proposed we had arrivals we had this 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.630
 a pig 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.920
 diego's goal those times 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.350
 Professor understands that this is the team 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.680
 that is already taking shape to ask for the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.680
 branch 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 lack still poor 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.430
 ending your period of the season 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 we still have to recover some that have not yet 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 they are in your life 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 us what we sell in week and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.550
 this week 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.880
 daily they were that is about 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.880
 we are oriented to eternal life 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.950
 We had already talked to the glass 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 happened if he does not care about everything 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 approaching hopefully 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.720
 why are 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:05.250
 complicates the climate or favors 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.670
 Mira dreams of playing in a fast court in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.810
 cold maybe we lost that advantage for the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.580
 uneven heat and restaurants but 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.800
 we also give other things and what 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.700
 advantages we do not want to take it out we want 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.700
 take out about a procedure 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.360
 and I hope we play in this climate 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.500
 I always studied cited content because 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.500
 given other things 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.069
 very resisted at times in the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.689
 unfair presentation and now in certain 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.790
 This is how things stand 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.079
 inevitable of daniel in the process 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.220
 he's just getting to know each other good 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.370
 long vacation companions 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.930
 the people well support him sometimes are a 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.300
 casual medium and stop reasoning 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 As the moment asks 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.819
 but now comes his victory is a guy 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.569
 winner 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.980
 they broke some rejection 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.130
 this bad he had at the start of the game 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.900
 and gave us the security of solvency 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.989
 the constant limitation 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.689
 an unusual time surely for you 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.939
 or any of these guys and some 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.300
 short as all there was no way to 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.030
 link with those above 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.250
 but good this one has to adapt to the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.860
 circumstances was for both teams and 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:33.520
 it is also late 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.520
 to link the pitch 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.920
 that complicated us the fact of 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:48.370
 do not see a partner with 25 treatments 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.370
 as well as to this party we can 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.190
 so complicated teachers that says the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.959
 injuries of ruiz díaz díaz is 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.400
 totally in benefits trained very 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:09.610
 well he 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:12.730
 it is a muscular discomfort of the plant 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.690
 of your foot for your luck we have swum without 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.940
 a normal day break from selling it 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.060
 did almost everyone was also from 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.610
 caution then I had many 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.550
 an arrival knowing that people were coming 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.410
 but the comment from us is 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.320
 always prioritize the health of 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.250
 boys and not lose them analyze them in 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.250
 2 3 4 weeks 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.650
 today it was good to know that there is no 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.810
 assured on Friday we have it totally 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.700
 teacher the message to spot the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.770
 video 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.720
 although it is not accompanying this we are going 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.840
 to win all together do not do it over 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.350
 powerful team like the admitted one we 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.310
 we will give all the support and support 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:06.170
 what the team feel like clothed 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:10.100
 it's not your luck to velarde the weight at 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:13.010
 favorite and today we have it and we join them and 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.510
 we present to power everything so that 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.920
 be transmitted to people and people come 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.920
 like that trust of supporting and 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.570
 the comparisons are odious but 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:32.080
 measure who me with the attitude that the 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:35.949
 last year, that's not non-negotiable 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.830
 the success of it is today we have this 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.270
 a little more quality but the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.430
 Team attitude has always been to go to 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.770
 seek and try to be the protagonist of 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.409
 local sometimes with more lights with less 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.389
 lights that we have to thank the 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.389
 boys who were last year 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.250
 time 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:15.669
 crystal we have seen hit a lot 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:19.270
 has hit enough is not a game of 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.770
 according to the manuel style we have 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.530
 of those playing the i's 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.680
 sometimes you favor some friction to 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.960
 sometimes it gets complicated but he wants rhythm and 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.550
 all at least we know that 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.229
 only of skills and that what you 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.870
 it comes well to the strict tur and as such 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.610
 you have to adapt and there's nothing 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.350
 reproach a nice match comes out on base 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.350
 the style nor president matters 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.810
 I did not mention it for a while and with all 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.909
 that creative inventiveness track in 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.419
 Canary aníbal not hold the ball does not 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.419
 increases its pace 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.850
 I do not know I think we need at the moment 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.110
 of the game in a fast court like 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.110
 rival and others 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.860
 i
