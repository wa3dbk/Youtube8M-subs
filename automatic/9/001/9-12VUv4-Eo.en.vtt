00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
some things the thing about the ocean

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520 
some things the thing about the ocean
that<00:01:20.820> looks<00:01:20.970> old<00:01:21.210> wrecks<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> stuff<00:01:21.930> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that looks old wrecks and stuff it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
that looks old wrecks and stuff it's
because<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.009> didn't<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.460> want<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> make<00:01:23.909> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
because I didn't just want to make this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.890 
because I didn't just want to make this
a<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.509> block<00:01:24.689> ocean<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> thought<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> would

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
a one block ocean so I thought I would

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.960 
a one block ocean so I thought I would
just<00:01:29.060> leave<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.479> things

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.470 
good I don't want to spoil anything so I
won't<00:01:47.170> get<00:01:47.380> really<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:48.070> won't<00:01:48.790> get<00:01:48.940> too<00:01:49.090> far<00:01:49.360> in

that<00:01:49.690> but<00:01:50.080> right<00:01:50.920> here<00:01:50.980> this<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.970> big<00:01:52.180> hill

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
that but right here this is the big hill

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.080 
that but right here this is the big hill
thing<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:54.070> believe<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.550> or<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:55.060> really

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
thing and believe it or not it really

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.380 
thing and believe it or not it really
does<00:01:55.840> take<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> long<00:01:56.500> time<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.980> build<00:01:57.160> because<00:01:57.880> I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
does take a long time to build because I

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.450 
does take a long time to build because I
don't<00:01:58.690> use<00:01:58.990> worldedit<00:01:59.590> or<00:01:59.920> anything<00:02:00.130> like

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
don't use worldedit or anything like

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.570 
don't use worldedit or anything like
that<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:01.000> may<00:02:01.870> or<00:02:02.140> may<00:02:02.290> not<00:02:02.320> start<00:02:02.860> using<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.430> but

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that I may or may not start using it but

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.330 
that I may or may not start using it but
most<00:02:03.970> likely<00:02:04.180> not

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
most likely not

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.490 
most likely not
so<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.700> takes<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.030> long<00:02:07.240> time<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.660> stopped<00:02:08.140> to

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
so this takes a long time I stopped to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.320 
so this takes a long time I stopped to
do<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.770> other<00:02:08.979> side<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.520> I'm<00:02:09.640> barely<00:02:09.970> done

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
do the other side and I'm barely done

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.440 
do the other side and I'm barely done
with<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:11.380> side<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:13.000> yeah

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
with this side but yeah

what this is but what I do is I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.610 
what this is but what I do is I
basically<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.700> beach<00:02:54.700> city<00:02:55.090> map<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.380> put

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
basically get a beach city map and I put

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.699 
basically get a beach city map and I put
the<00:02:56.739> image<00:02:57.100> right<00:02:57.370> next<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.820> me<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.600> build<00:02:59.410> it

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
the image right next to me and build it

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.320 
the image right next to me and build it
and<00:02:59.890> stuff<00:03:00.160> because<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:00.700> an<00:03:00.790> overview<00:03:01.239> of

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
and stuff because it's an overview of

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.830 
and stuff because it's an overview of
the<00:03:01.720> beach<00:03:01.959> city<00:03:02.260> map<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.610> try<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.060> basically

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
the beach city map so I try to basically

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.930 
the beach city map so I try to basically
mimic<00:03:05.590> all<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.890> buildings<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.519> stuff<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:06.880> I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
mimic all the buildings and stuff but I

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.289 
mimic all the buildings and stuff but I
think<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> garage<00:03:08.140> or<00:03:08.410> something

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.270 
think this is like a garage or something

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
let's get into the giant lady statue

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.790 
let's get into the giant lady statue
thing<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:56.240> she<00:04:56.330> usually<00:04:56.630> has<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> lot<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.470> moss

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
thing so she usually has a lot of moss

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.659 
thing so she usually has a lot of moss
around<00:04:58.070> her<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.729> I<00:04:59.360> try<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.630> make<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.669> as

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
around her and I try to make this as

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.530 
around her and I try to make this as
epic<00:05:02.150> as<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.419> can<00:05:02.750> because<00:05:03.760> for<00:05:04.760> me<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.240> think

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
epic as I can because for me it I think

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.960 
epic as I can because for me it I think
it<00:05:05.660> looks<00:05:05.870> pretty<00:05:06.050> cool<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.919> be<00:05:06.950> honest<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.729> I

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
it looks pretty cool to be honest and I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.969 
it looks pretty cool to be honest and I
like<00:05:08.479> how<00:05:08.660> it<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:08.930> came<00:05:09.229> out<00:05:09.380> but<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.710> hand

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
like how it this came out but the hand

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.250 
like how it this came out but the hand
looks<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.370> little<00:05:10.520> funny<00:05:10.880> though<00:05:11.120> because<00:05:11.300> it's

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
looks a little funny though because it's

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.280 
looks a little funny though because it's
a<00:05:12.320> little<00:05:12.470> bit<00:05:12.680> way<00:05:12.860> too<00:05:12.919> big<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.669> think<00:05:14.290> but

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
a little bit way too big I think but

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.480 
a little bit way too big I think but
yeah<00:05:16.070> I'm<00:05:16.550> not<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.750> isn't<00:05:17.990> perfect<00:05:18.440> but<00:05:19.040> it's

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
yeah I'm not this isn't perfect but it's

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.390 
yeah I'm not this isn't perfect but it's
good<00:05:19.640> enough<00:05:19.820> for<00:05:20.240> me<00:05:21.100> what<00:05:22.100> else

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
good enough for me what else

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.360 
good enough for me what else
oh<00:05:22.460> yeah<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.790> lighthouse<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:23.720> thing<00:05:24.340> yeah<00:05:25.340> I

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
oh yeah the lighthouse this thing yeah I

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.800 
oh yeah the lighthouse this thing yeah I
haven't<00:05:25.610> really<00:05:25.760> worked<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.540> at<00:05:26.690> home

haven't really worked on that at home

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.360 
haven't really worked on that at home

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.840 
probably gonna make up like major stuff
on<00:05:31.700> it<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.060> don't<00:05:32.270> even<00:05:32.390> know<00:05:32.770> but<00:05:33.770> yeah<00:05:34.340> that's

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850

sure<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.460> update<00:05:37.940> this<00:05:38.270> with<00:05:38.510> video<00:05:38.900> probably

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
sure to update this with video probably

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.760 
sure to update this with video probably
every<00:05:40.280> month<00:05:40.310> there<00:05:40.850> every<00:05:41.180> few<00:05:41.390> weeks<00:05:41.450> or<00:05:41.990> at

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
every month there every few weeks or at

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.020 
every month there every few weeks or at
least<00:05:42.979> once<00:05:43.190> I've<00:05:43.370> done<00:05:43.550> enough<00:05:43.850> I'm<00:05:44.000> not

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
least once I've done enough I'm not

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.520 
least once I've done enough I'm not
really<00:05:44.330> sure<00:05:44.600> but<00:05:45.669> this<00:05:46.669> has<00:05:47.120> been<00:05:47.450> a<00:05:47.720> huge

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
really sure but this has been a huge

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.520 
really sure but this has been a huge
pain<00:05:49.010> in<00:05:49.040> the<00:05:49.340> butt<00:05:49.760> because<00:05:50.060> I<00:05:50.570> need<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.229> fill

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
pain in the butt because I need to fill

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.610 
pain in the butt because I need to fill
out<00:05:51.710> all<00:05:51.950> of<00:05:52.160> these<00:05:52.400> palm<00:05:52.820> things<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:54.440> need

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
out all of these palm things and I need

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.590 
out all of these palm things and I need
to<00:05:54.710> place<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.130> water<00:05:55.400> I<00:05:55.550> need<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:56.090> get<00:05:56.390> rid<00:05:56.570> of

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
to place the water I need to get rid of

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.469 
to place the water I need to get rid of
this<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.260> expand<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.800> water<00:05:58.010> and<00:05:58.310> it<00:05:59.090> takes<00:05:59.300> a

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
this to expand the water and it takes a

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.450 
this to expand the water and it takes a
long<00:05:59.660> time<00:05:59.690> so<00:06:00.620> that's<00:06:00.830> probably<00:06:01.070> why<00:06:01.430> I

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
long time so that's probably why I

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.029 
long time so that's probably why I
really<00:06:01.760> don't<00:06:02.000> upload<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.780> mean<00:06:03.380> update<00:06:03.800> this

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
really don't upload I mean update this

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:04.540 
really don't upload I mean update this

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.240 
and pee
see<00:06:04.759> too<00:06:04.970> much<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.650> update<00:06:06.650> the<00:06:06.770> world<00:06:06.949> safe

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
see too much and update the world safe

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.900 
see too much and update the world safe
because<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:08.919> just<00:06:09.919> do<00:06:10.099> this<00:06:10.280> little<00:06:10.520> by<00:06:10.669> little

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
because I just do this little by little

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.240 
because I just do this little by little
I<00:06:11.180> don't<00:06:11.240> actually<00:06:11.539> try<00:06:12.020> working<00:06:12.680> on<00:06:12.949> in<00:06:13.129> law

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
I don't actually try working on in law

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.610 
I don't actually try working on in law
