imported<00:04:06.129> so<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:06.849> believe<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.419> take

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
imported so I believe you have to take

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.319 
imported so I believe you have to take
off<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.840> wristband<00:04:09.810> ok<00:04:11.609> ok<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:12.879> by<00:04:13.269> just

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
off the wristband ok ok so by just

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.939 
off the wristband ok ok so by just
looking<00:04:13.720> at<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.989> believe<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:14.439> is<00:04:14.500> where<00:04:14.769> this

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
looking at I believe this is where this

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.969 
looking at I believe this is where this
goes<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.989> put<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.259> in<00:04:17.349> and<00:04:17.620> then<00:04:17.739> just

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
goes and just put it in and then just

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.909 
goes and just put it in and then just
hold<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.250> wrist<00:04:18.459> band<00:04:18.669> together<00:04:18.789> so<00:04:19.659> it<00:04:20.620> works

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
hold the wrist band together so it works

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.810 
hold the wrist band together so it works
I<00:04:21.190> think<00:04:22.150> haha<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.860> bill<00:04:24.070> at<00:04:24.190> one<00:04:24.370> side<00:04:24.580> and

if I just lift this up if I show you
this<00:05:41.000> is<00:05:41.270> where<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.540> charger<00:05:41.690> goes<00:05:42.050> right

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
this is where the charger goes right

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.720 
this is where the charger goes right
there<00:05:43.090> put<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.180> in<00:05:44.240> there<00:05:44.450> and<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:46.580> should

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
there put it in there and you should

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.900 
there put it in there and you should
start<00:05:46.970> charging<00:05:48.130> there<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.220> go<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:49.730> just

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
start charging there you go and you just

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
not charging and then I believe you just
