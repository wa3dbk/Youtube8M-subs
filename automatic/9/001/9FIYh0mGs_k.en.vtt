00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.569
 they are 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:09.919
 I do not crack 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.279
 Follow the path 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.099
 Now you can see another multimedia document with Claus Triebel 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.400
 Please do not go further into the forest area 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:24.339
 this are under protection 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.339
 al 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.779
 but since you are there we are now 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.430
 East Frank TuS Rohbau Berges arrived at the site of the us dollar 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.240
 but still in the woods 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.490
 and we see her in the swath 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.790
 lies behind me 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.890
 a series of closely spaced ones 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.700
 builds judges of Roman times 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.269
 there are again this duty such wells by a jacket Genk 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.810
 Bausch did not fear it 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.389
 and things judge »then Lander that is 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.170
 Here we are only about 10 12 meters 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 over 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.210
 the great sole 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.470
 unlike them, 27 meters were saved over death so here's backs 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.280
 the tunnels pitted poets together and that is the goal the impact of who 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.630
 Construction above 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.240
 At this point I would like to tell you something about the history of tunneling 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 tell 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 this tunnel becomes the vet 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.140
 in the middle of the second century AD we have no certificate 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.649
 could have construction in writings 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.880
 but from the historical context we can say that 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.170
 the tunneling is not further back lamb peace already heard that no 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.200
 Mining began a thousand before Christ 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.520
 In ancient Iran the Etruscans arrived 700 BC 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.400
 but so real 2 0 big buildings so what we have here is a thousand 660 meters long 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.660
 this is for the first time to prove 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.179
 700 BC 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.130
 Became 701 BC 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.240
 Jerusalem besieged and King Basquiat 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.710
 builds a tunnel around a source outside the city lie 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.840
 in the city area 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.340
 In astonishingly, this pool will bid in the presence of procedure 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100
 what is the first one 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.299
 in the rather moderately built tunnel of history 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.949
 701 BC 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.550
 the second one comes 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.129
 in the second half of the sixth century BC 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.369
 a very important building 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.750
 Olp Albinos Brutzsch for the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.310
 for all Polywka test on the island of Samos 1036 meter long tunnel 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.279
 a water supply for the city 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.689
 On the other hand, this tunnel is also constructed and because 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.169
 Pauli - is the first engineer to proceed moderately with this structure 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.959
 he even brings insurance 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.140
 Driving down to meet compulsively 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.279
 he did not make one with a lot 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.489
 «Half asleep» 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.690
 and that went to the lot from the side to meet I call that a final 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.329
 Insurance paid 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.659
 that's just awesome to extend and perform something like that 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.230
 and he actually brings the water supply that way 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.470
 for Sam must be done these are the first two major tunnels 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.629
 the route post-doc then come to Tyrol still come afterwards 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.559
 and the largest Roman 2 0 is that of Claudius at the Functional Lake on the Lago 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:15.180
 Fuji No Daum in front of him already talked about six kilometers long 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.360
 bounced with Paul bad from 122 yards 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.009
 a grandiose structure 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.369
 with whom she also stood 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.369
 and let me represent Pliny writes the newspaper 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.909
 In the Prose area here tunneling begins almost everywhere until the second 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.629
 Century after Christ 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.730
 As I said at the Obermosel the tunnel we have a lot in Luxembourg 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.810
 very big and also 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.960
 wonderful office without to be visited is the fast Pletzer tunnel of choice 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.869
 of those in Luxembourg 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:48.119
 and then of course we have this building something with breaks 660 meters 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.700
 give 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.620
 really belonged to the large buildings of antiquity the old one the longest 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.700
 Tunnel for long-distance travel that were the only tunnel 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.989
 but if we look further then in the story 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.089
 over time to the middle of the fifth century when we see the 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.180
 Consider times after the Romans 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.099
 like the first railway tunnel in Germany 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.139
 1837 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.010
 until 39 is in Oberau in Saxony 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.169
 The first railway tunnel was built and parallel to it in Königsdorf near Cologne 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.549
 also a railway tunnel from 18 7 30 to 41 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.550
 These are the first major banks of modern times, neither in Calmbach need 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.560
 Journey one does not believe it again with shafts around the propulsion Koch 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.349
 hold 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.899
 but in between in these breaks 500 years 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.370
 have not been received yet 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.409
 only four tunnels have been built 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.020
 You can see how difficult that is 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.890
 to master this technique 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.320
 and amazing is that three of these would do of monastery communities 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.190
 are built 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.710
 in Salzburg in 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.690
 Thuringia 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.020
 and at the Laacher See in Maria Laach in the twelfth century 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.530
 a terrific tool to ensure flood protection 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.719
 also in this antique technique 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.139
 the shaft construction 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.139
 the light still process Pauli came dismantling way as you want 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.370
 the monks of the Middle Ages was built in the twelfth century 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.180
 This tour will be the monks 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.050
 in a position 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.430
 calls to read because the Truth as an antique cargo ship Steller describes in 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.600
 his ten books on architecture 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.169
 very well in the country or builds 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.710
 that was written in Latin which some could read so what the monks 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.059
 also had manuscripts 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.850
 in the sowas read what they copied they surrounded them further 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.900
 the medieval monks Kurt Bloch in Italy 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.780
 tunnels still in operation in special and see and from it 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.699
 learn and then build their tunnels 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.250
 if we then Arber 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.849
 19 97 still a fourth 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.490
 medieval 2 discovered by a secular builder in the Middle Ages 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.490
 built in the 15th century 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.370
 percentage of Tiergarten after the 2 0 can reduce heathen to supply 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.180
 the castle Blankenheim 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.700
 then that flows into a completely different constellation is a real builder 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.610
 who is the technology 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.569
 We use percent of learned animals pictures to master builders 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.710
 Perhaps one of his engineers from the mines could do that 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.729
 he had 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.449
 the Blankenheim species Verizon Mines 1 9% ore mining 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.199
 Percent maybe one was knowledgeable and could build in this newspaper 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.849
 So if we have one more time for the 97th 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.849
 rediscovered medieval tunnels then this is a historical technique 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:30.740
 sensation 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.090
 and there it closes 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.860
 and so tunneling research in the Rhineland we have 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.630
 in the Rhineland actually from all times 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.430
 some club ork 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.880
 Bäumer temporal tunnel construction advertise medieval tower built and we 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.479
 have the first train 2 0 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.539
 in Königsdorf 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:46.620
 the Rhineland 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.689
 is concerning this kind 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.279
 in the history of technology of this type or building technology in the history of technology 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:57.230
 Open-air museum biggest often enough, it is worth to come here 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.139
 and to look at it when you look at yourself 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.580
 interested in these things 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.639
 We are here now as I said from Hankes Pudels also at the end of this 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.439
 Tunnels and 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.469
 So actually at the end of our hike avoid small round or 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:14.749
 Sleeping room through the history of tunneling 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:18.160
 we have a tunnel construction in the terrain very well 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.020
 Percent 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.220
 Percent we have learned something about connecting more difficult techniques in 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.369
 the antique 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.219
 and as far as I am, I'm glad they were there 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:32.639
 I had fun with him through the Drover Heath 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.559
 Recommend us to visit the others as well 

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:39.740
 from the Tiergartentunnel in Blankenheim one can still 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.980
 see many remains and there is also a hiking trail the Tiergartentunnel 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.020
 trail 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.020
 if they have fun the monsters resist 

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:55.639
 Yemen continues to score seven athletes is summer 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.680
 Now they are commenting on the stage of the ditch 

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:10.009
 more
