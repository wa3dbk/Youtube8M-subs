00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850
 Y 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.940
 notice that today I bring you a little advice 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.180
 to undulate the hair of their pits 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.320
 we are going to make little tubes for the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.900
 hair to form the hair that we're going 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.240
 to occupy we are going to occupy these little tubes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.989
 of plastic that they use to put them 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.989
 The balloon 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.550
 and glue that sticks crazy foami's 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.800
 those that we go to a dollar 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.530
 we cut it from the thin bones that 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.129
 we want 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.129
 suspenders 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:02.510
 a dryer and scissors that's all we're going 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.670
 to start the first thing we are going to do 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.150
 cut 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.250
 our plastic tube to the size that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.290
 we want to make the tube of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.500
 according to the thickness that we are going to wave 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.770
 our hair on our tab 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.229
 we are going to cut it 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.549
 and we're going to grab a league of those from 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.520
 the little ones of those who see me 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.270
 as it will be about 3 centimeters are of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 the smallest 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 we're going to cut it 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.360
 and we are going to make a knot 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.060
 at the tip 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.250
 nudite 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.650
 it gives us the excess 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.650
 since we made the nudite at the tip 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.900
 let's grab our little tube 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.340
 and we're going to put glue that sticks 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.850
 madness to both parties so that it is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.600
 stuck inside and we do not fight that 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.600
 we are going to walk taking 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.390
 grab a stick or what you guys 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.730
 want so that the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.730
 knot inside the tube chick 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.280
 and that we stay well attached and not 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.560
 it is done to us 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.620
 at the beginning, of course, they are going to battle 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.840
 but since they have their tubes well agusto 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.599
 that are going to be doing 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.080
 and the curls to the dates as well as that 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.930
 very natural 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.880
 and if they are fixed it is stuck on one side 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 tucked in and on the other side we're going to tangle 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.900
 what in our 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.300
 in our hair the date and what 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.520
 we are going to put in this way you are going to battle 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.600
 least since it grabs in practice this what 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.330
 just 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.400
 be here in sant I said what I'm going to do and 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.410
 it stays like this should not be tight 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.380
 so that it does not mark the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.120
 the league itself and that our 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.370
 tubes for hair depths 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.150
 perfect 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.130
 Well, we 're going to get involved in our 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.370
 Hair of our date 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.000
 according to what the corrugated we want 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.910
 if we want it no more than the pure point 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.320
 we just want to override everything more more 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.760
 small higher up between higher 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:48.490
 it is therefore more wavy remains what can 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.490
 leave as I said 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.319
 This is imposing heat or putting the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.999
 dryer 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.540
 me when battaglia in a little bit by 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:05.700
 my nails but 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.700
 we're just going to put it on the other side 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.520
 and it should not be tight 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.010
 because if you leave it tight 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.590
 take out the league press the foam and then it 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.950
 is going to mark everything is marked then it should 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.100
 to be like that, nothing more than to hold you 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.380
 the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.380
 the horse of the futh 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.440
 well this did not put air and was 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.389
 so this ripple to this we are going to 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.870
 put hot air that would be with the with 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.870
 the dryer 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.729
 they do not need to put it a long time 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.250
 and take them out and see how good you are 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.320
 I hope this idea of these beautiful 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.080
 tubes to make the hair of 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.050
 our chips you liked and if 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.750
 They liked it and they have the little hand and tell me 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.750
 like see you in another video
