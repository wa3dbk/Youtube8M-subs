00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
his standalone head but I get more into

his standalone head but I get more into
the<00:01:15.229> detail<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.830> character<00:01:16.250> when<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:16.550> open

the detail on the character when I open

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.730 
the detail on the character when I open
up<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.270> figure<00:01:17.630> in<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.170> meantime<00:01:18.350> though

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
up the figure in the meantime though

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.139 
up the figure in the meantime though
let's<00:01:18.950> have<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> look<00:01:19.280> at<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.490> packaging<00:01:19.970> it's

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
let's have a look at the packaging it's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.910 
let's have a look at the packaging it's
the<00:01:20.240> same<00:01:20.450> as<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.899> other<00:01:21.050> ones<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:21.619> have<00:01:21.890> a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the same as the other ones so you have a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.550 
the same as the other ones so you have a
starburst<00:01:22.580> effect<00:01:22.790> they<00:01:23.690> have<00:01:23.899> removed<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
starburst effect they have removed the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.100 
starburst effect they have removed the
comic<00:01:25.100> book<00:01:25.310> edition<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.149> instead<00:01:26.570> given<00:01:26.990> us

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
comic book edition but instead given us

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.800 
comic book edition but instead given us
this<00:01:29.410> can<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.500> say<00:01:30.770> deplorable<00:01:31.430> I<00:01:31.729> think<00:01:32.660> that's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
this can I say deplorable I think that's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.109 
this can I say deplorable I think that's
probably<00:01:32.990> too<00:01:33.259> extreme<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.039> do<00:01:34.399> not<00:01:34.850> like

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
probably too extreme but I do not like

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.969 
probably too extreme but I do not like
this<00:01:35.360> backdrop<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.229> think<00:01:36.410> it's<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:36.830> a

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
this backdrop I just think it's it's a

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.160 
this backdrop I just think it's it's a
waste<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.179> could<00:01:38.360> have<00:01:38.450> given<00:01:38.569> us<00:01:38.810> even<00:01:39.080> a

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
waste and you could have given us even a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.770 
waste and you could have given us even a
poster<00:01:39.619> even<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.220> poster<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.030> think<00:01:41.569> would<00:01:41.720> have

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
poster even a poster I think would have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.570 
poster even a poster I think would have
been<00:01:41.899> nicer<00:01:42.319> than<00:01:42.470> giving<00:01:42.770> us<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.920> backdrop

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
been nicer than giving us a backdrop

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.809 
been nicer than giving us a backdrop
this<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.720> don't<00:01:45.619> know<00:01:45.770> any<00:01:46.069> collector

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
this this I don't know any collector

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.300 
this this I don't know any collector
that<00:01:47.270> first<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.289> all<00:01:48.410> wants<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.830> utilize<00:01:49.280> that

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
that first of all wants to utilize that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.580 
that first of all wants to utilize that
much<00:01:49.819> space<00:01:50.149> on<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> shelf<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.500> they

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
much space on a shelf just so that they

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.800 
much space on a shelf just so that they
can<00:01:51.740> have<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.920> backsplash<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:53.149> just<00:01:53.600> kind<00:01:53.750> of

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
can have a backsplash I just kind of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.609 
can have a backsplash I just kind of
think<00:01:53.959> it's<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.200> point<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.649> pointless<00:01:55.179> addition

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
think it's a point a pointless addition

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.410 
think it's a point a pointless addition
but<00:01:57.619> there<00:01:58.009> we<00:01:58.100> had<00:01:58.190> mr.<00:01:58.429> freeze<00:01:58.700> on<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.179> back

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
but there we had mr. freeze on the back

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.089 
but there we had mr. freeze on the back
the<00:01:59.750> other<00:01:59.780> characters<00:02:00.289> in<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.500> wave<00:02:00.709> are<00:02:01.539> the

the other characters in the wave are the

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.620 
the other characters in the wave are the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.930 

leaves<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.710> bad<00:02:55.920> taste<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.430> my<00:02:56.490> mouth<00:02:56.580> every

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.790 
time I think about that movie that's not
try<00:03:00.690> not<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.020> think<00:03:01.200> about<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.440> right<00:03:01.650> now

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
try not to think about it right now

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.880 
try not to think about it right now
let's<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.130> look<00:03:02.490> at<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.890> nicer-looking

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
let's actually look at the nicer-looking

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.550 
let's actually look at the nicer-looking
mr.<00:03:05.520> freeze<00:03:05.790> then<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.150> god-awful

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
mr. freeze then that god-awful

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200 
mr. freeze then that god-awful
Schwarzenegger<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.680> mr.<00:03:07.980> freeze<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.940> figure

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
Schwarzenegger of mr. freeze the figure

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.200 
Schwarzenegger of mr. freeze the figure
itself<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:10.920> nice<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
itself is really really nice the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.230 
itself is really really nice the
coloring<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.140> probably<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.470> most<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
coloring I think is probably the most is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.570 
coloring I think is probably the most is
probably<00:03:15.240> one<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.560> biggest<00:03:16.580> selling

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
probably one of the biggest selling

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.400 
probably one of the biggest selling
points<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.180> figure<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.690> mean<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.320> get

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
points of this figure I mean you get

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.980 
points of this figure I mean you get
this<00:03:19.590> really<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.100> nice<00:03:20.459> blue<00:03:21.060> bluish

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
this really really nice blue bluish

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.590 
this really really nice blue bluish
color<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.560> don't<00:03:23.340> know<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.760> skin<00:03:24.209> because

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
color I don't know if it's skin because

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.420 
color I don't know if it's skin because
it's<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.080> hard<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.500> quite<00:03:25.709> make<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:25.980> out<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it's it's hard to quite make it out it

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.930 
it's it's hard to quite make it out it
looks<00:03:26.459> here<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.209> it's<00:03:27.420> part<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.720> his<00:03:27.870> body

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
looks here like it's part of his body

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.480 
looks here like it's part of his body
but<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.240> he's<00:03:30.450> got<00:03:30.690> these<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:32.130> looks<00:03:32.340> like

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
but then he's got these it looks like

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.940 
but then he's got these it looks like
it's<00:03:32.640> armor<00:03:33.090> here<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:34.170> don't<00:03:34.530> know<00:03:34.650> if<00:03:34.800> these

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
it's armor here so I don't know if these

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800 
it's armor here so I don't know if these
are<00:03:35.100> supposed<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.400> be<00:03:35.490> his<00:03:35.640> arms<00:03:35.970> or<00:03:36.690> if

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
are supposed to be his arms or if

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.710 
are supposed to be his arms or if
they're<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.020> repaints<00:03:37.770> over<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.720> I'm

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
they're just repaints over of what I'm

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.570 
they're just repaints over of what I'm
almost<00:03:40.080> thinking<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> repaint

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
almost thinking it was a repaint

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.160 
almost thinking it was a repaint
they've<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:42.000> repainted<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.020> was

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
they've just repainted this this was

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.230 
they've just repainted this this was
supposed<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.380> be<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> different<00:03:43.770> color<00:03:44.060> but<00:03:45.060> I

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
supposed to be a different color but I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.900 
supposed to be a different color but I
do<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.810> blue<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.320> also<00:03:47.100> do<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.670> fact

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
do like the blue I also do like the fact

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.680 
do like the blue I also do like the fact
that<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:49.140> can<00:03:49.320> even<00:03:49.470> see<00:03:50.690> condensation

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
that the you can even see condensation

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.780 
that the you can even see condensation
on<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.470> inside<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.010> his<00:03:53.100> mask<00:03:53.310> from<00:03:53.580> him

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
on the inside of his mask from him

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.810 
on the inside of his mask from him
breathing<00:03:54.709> well<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.739> guess<00:03:56.280> where<00:03:56.489> his<00:03:56.580> breath

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
breathing well I guess where his breath

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.790 
breathing well I guess where his breath
is<00:03:56.970> froze<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.630> because<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.410> can<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.680> these

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
is froze to because you can see these

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.410 
is froze to because you can see these
little<00:03:59.130> specks<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.580> snow<00:03:59.820> which<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.180> really

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
little specks of snow which is really

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.650 
little specks of snow which is really
really<00:04:00.570> nice<00:04:00.750> as<00:04:01.560> well<00:04:02.180> they've<00:04:03.180> really<00:04:03.510> done

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
really nice as well they've really done

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.600 
really nice as well they've really done
a<00:04:03.720> good<00:04:03.900> job<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.410> see<00:04:04.950> even<00:04:05.250> like

a good job that you can see even like

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.670 
a good job that you can see even like
parts<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.690> ice<00:04:06.930> where<00:04:07.320> his<00:04:07.500> suit<00:04:08.190> has<00:04:08.400> froze

came<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.580> us<00:04:20.730> prior<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.540> DC<00:04:21.870> superheroes<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.740> I

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
came to us prior to DC superheroes so I

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.130 
came to us prior to DC superheroes so I
would<00:04:23.010> say<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.430> figure<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:23.880> really<00:04:24.150> nice<00:04:24.450> if

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
would say this figure is really nice if

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.980 
would say this figure is really nice if
you've<00:04:25.410> seen<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.770> review<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.130> Bane<00:04:26.490> as

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
you've seen my review of Bane as

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.300 
you've seen my review of Bane as
disappointed<00:04:27.990> as<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.260> was<00:04:28.500> with<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.919> figure

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
disappointed as I was with that figure

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.390 
disappointed as I was with that figure
it's<00:04:29.520> it's<00:04:30.320> bittersweet<00:04:31.320> then<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.979> see<00:04:32.160> such<00:04:32.370> a

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
it's it's bittersweet then to see such a

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.880 
it's it's bittersweet then to see such a
nicely<00:04:33.240> sculpted<00:04:33.650> nicely<00:04:34.650> articulated

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
nicely sculpted nicely articulated

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.080 
nicely sculpted nicely articulated
figure<00:04:35.880> with<00:04:36.419> mr.<00:04:36.750> freeze<00:04:36.990> here<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
figure with mr. freeze here the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.460 
figure with mr. freeze here the
interesting<00:04:39.330> thing<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.720> point<00:04:39.960> out<00:04:40.110> as<00:04:40.290> well

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
interesting thing to point out as well

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.640 
interesting thing to point out as well
as<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.770> his<00:04:40.950> boots<00:04:41.220> these<00:04:42.260> not<00:04:43.260> sure<00:04:43.410> if<00:04:43.530> it's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
as in his boots these not sure if it's

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.080 
as in his boots these not sure if it's
from<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.890> waist<00:04:44.100> down<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.580> know<00:04:44.669> certainly

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
from the waist down but I know certainly

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.310 
from the waist down but I know certainly
with<00:04:45.300> these<00:04:45.450> boots<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.140> they<00:04:46.260> were

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
with these boots I think they were

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.580 
with these boots I think they were
reused<00:04:46.950> for<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.310> Lex<00:04:47.850> Luthor<00:04:48.540> figure<00:04:48.930> which<00:04:49.470> I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
reused for the Lex Luthor figure which I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.640 
reused for the Lex Luthor figure which I
will<00:04:49.740> also<00:04:49.770> be<00:04:50.190> doing<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.460> review<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.870> if<00:04:52.530> you

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
will also be doing a review of so if you

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.710 
will also be doing a review of so if you
guys<00:04:52.770> can<00:04:53.070> keep<00:04:53.729> an<00:04:53.850> eye<00:04:53.940> on<00:04:54.000> those<00:04:54.150> boots<00:04:54.419> here

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
guys can keep an eye on those boots here

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
guys can keep an eye on those boots here
and<00:04:54.840> see<00:04:55.020> I'm<00:04:55.169> pretty<00:04:55.530> sure

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
and see I'm pretty sure

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.029 
and see I'm pretty sure
they<00:04:55.979> are<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.280> exact<00:04:56.580> same<00:04:56.669> boots<00:04:57.060> but<00:04:58.039> really

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
they are the exact same boots but really

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.400 
they are the exact same boots but really
really<00:04:59.160> nice<00:04:59.430> detailing<00:04:59.910> on<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.449> on<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.139> head

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
really nice detailing on the on the head

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.010 
really nice detailing on the on the head
as<00:05:01.710> well<00:05:02.550> he's<00:05:02.759> got<00:05:02.910> that<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.300> goggles<00:05:03.750> it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
as well he's got that the goggles it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.580 
as well he's got that the goggles it
it's<00:05:04.770> almost<00:05:05.310> like<00:05:05.729> it's<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.599> mr.<00:05:07.259> freeze

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
it's almost like it's the mr. freeze

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.129 
it's almost like it's the mr. freeze
from<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.949> Batman<00:05:08.490> animated<00:05:08.699> series<00:05:09.389> but<00:05:09.900> just

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
from the Batman animated series but just

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.400 
from the Batman animated series but just
really<00:05:10.319> jacked<00:05:10.740> up<00:05:10.919> on<00:05:11.069> roids<00:05:12.020> if<00:05:13.020> we<00:05:13.139> put<00:05:13.319> the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
really jacked up on roids if we put the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.430 
really jacked up on roids if we put the
figure<00:05:13.620> down<00:05:13.770> just<00:05:14.039> for<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.220> second<00:05:14.610> here

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
figure down just for a second here

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.129 
figure down just for a second here
and<00:05:16.440> we<00:05:17.400> look<00:05:17.729> at<00:05:17.849> his<00:05:18.030> accessory<00:05:18.539> here<00:05:18.810> he

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
and we look at his accessory here he

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.430 
and we look at his accessory here he
comes<00:05:19.410> with<00:05:19.590> this<00:05:19.680> huge<00:05:20.690> energy<00:05:21.889> energy<00:05:22.889> gun

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
comes with this huge energy energy gun

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.800 
comes with this huge energy energy gun
freeze<00:05:25.440> gun<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.800> guess<00:05:26.130> his<00:05:26.490> freeze<00:05:26.819> gun<00:05:27.090> but<00:05:27.780> he

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
freeze gun I guess his freeze gun but he

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.240 
freeze gun I guess his freeze gun but he
also<00:05:27.960> comes<00:05:28.169> with<00:05:28.259> this<00:05:28.470> really<00:05:28.650> large<00:05:28.919> bat

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
also comes with this really large bat

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.490 
also comes with this really large bat
backpack<00:05:29.849> there's<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.270> peg<00:05:30.690> on<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.990> backpack

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
backpack there's a peg on the backpack

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.760 
backpack there's a peg on the backpack
here<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:32.430> she<00:05:32.669> can<00:05:32.819> sit<00:05:33.090> into<00:05:33.770> his<00:05:34.770> back<00:05:35.099> just

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
here that she can sit into his back just

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.460 
here that she can sit into his back just
snaps<00:05:37.770> into<00:05:37.949> place<00:05:38.159> there<00:05:40.610> like<00:05:41.610> that<00:05:41.819> and

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
snaps into place there like that and

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.170 
snaps into place there like that and
then<00:05:43.470> he's<00:05:43.620> got<00:05:43.740> all<00:05:44.009> these<00:05:44.220> hoses<00:05:44.819> and<00:05:44.940> stuff

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
then he's got all these hoses and stuff

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.089 
then he's got all these hoses and stuff
which<00:05:45.539> I<00:05:45.720> think<00:05:45.900> add<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.259> the<00:05:46.380> effect<00:05:46.650> of<00:05:47.039> the

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
which I think add to the effect of the

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:47.390 
which I think add to the effect of the
gun

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
gun

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.700 
gun
I<00:05:47.430> love<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.389> gun<00:05:48.599> though<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:48.870> mean<00:05:49.080> look<00:05:49.440> at<00:05:49.560> it

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
I love the gun though I mean look at it

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.170 
I love the gun though I mean look at it
I<00:05:49.740> mean<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:49.979> got<00:05:50.130> ice<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.729> everything<00:05:51.030> else

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
I mean you got ice and everything else

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.620 
I mean you got ice and everything else
on<00:05:51.479> it<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:53.250> can<00:05:53.400> actually<00:05:53.520> see<00:05:53.729> where<00:05:54.389> the

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
on it you can actually see where the

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.420 
on it you can actually see where the
barrel<00:05:55.169> has<00:05:55.349> frozen<00:05:56.069> from<00:05:56.400> firing<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.509> energy

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
barrel has frozen from firing the energy

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.730 
barrel has frozen from firing the energy
firing<00:05:59.430> the<00:06:01.400> firing<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:03.090> ice<00:06:03.270> here<00:06:03.740> now

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
firing the firing the the ice here now

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.029 
firing the firing the the ice here now
one<00:06:05.039> thing<00:06:05.340> that's<00:06:05.639> interesting<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:06.719> I<00:06:07.289> they

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
one thing that's interesting and I they

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.649 
one thing that's interesting and I they
actually<00:06:08.400> don't<00:06:08.610> mention<00:06:08.820> it<00:06:09.030> on<00:06:09.180> this<00:06:09.419> figure

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
actually don't mention it on this figure

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.170 
actually don't mention it on this figure
I'm<00:06:10.620> looking<00:06:10.979> at<00:06:11.070> the<00:06:11.190> figure<00:06:11.460> itself<00:06:11.610> here

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
I'm looking at the figure itself here

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.149 
I'm looking at the figure itself here
and<00:06:12.419> if<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:12.690> look<00:06:12.990> on<00:06:13.169> the<00:06:13.320> end<00:06:13.349> barrel

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
and if you look on the end barrel

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.600 
and if you look on the end barrel
there's<00:06:15.090> an<00:06:15.270> actual<00:06:15.599> nozzle<00:06:16.199> it<00:06:17.009> almost<00:06:17.340> looks

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
there's an actual nozzle it almost looks

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.700 
there's an actual nozzle it almost looks
like<00:06:17.669> this<00:06:18.060> is<00:06:18.389> supposed<00:06:18.780> to<00:06:18.840> fire<00:06:19.199> something

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
like this is supposed to fire something

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.969 
like this is supposed to fire something
I<00:06:19.860> don't<00:06:20.130> know<00:06:20.190> whether<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.550> be<00:06:20.610> water<00:06:20.940> or<00:06:21.979> or

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
I don't know whether it be water or or

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.459
