00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello how about good friends let's do 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.729
 then a tutorial of how 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.729
 record our videogame games 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.529
 it can be clear that this is your program 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.870
 It's not rap or other 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.990
 this program is called fan 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.140
 what we are going to do is to install it 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.350
 well we are not going to download the raps 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.150
 because when we make a video with him 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.770
 with the brahms program 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.600
 then that language weighs a lot and with this 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.130
 little program that I have here is but good 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.130
 I'm going to tell 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.500
 is 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.950
 our saint to be over us 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.260
 Program 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:52.720
 but with this program we can also 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.030
 record this tutorials and more stuff here 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.370
 is this program is with which we are going to 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.370
 record video games we can prove it 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.330
 let's see the window lens 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.730
 all right 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.580
 this is a window this is to record 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.660
 the for 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.660
 for example 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.380
 for tutorials but in this case what 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.480
 we will use for the place 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.330
 It is a very good program that serves us 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.800
 to record from well places tutorials 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.390
 good as we are not going to download without list 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.540
 for how we will download without 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 license we are going to tax only a few 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 10 minutes with the program license 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.600
 recorded more but in this case we are going to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.990
 download without license here we can 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.140
 put that is for the gameplay or 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.590
 video game that is for the rectangle 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.910
 we can adjust for example let's 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.910
 find another 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.440
 you can put the dimensions that 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.610
 we want 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.180
 nothing else is to look for that red box is what 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.860
 We compounding we can get out of here like that 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 only part was going to record 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.670
 well we got out of that and we're going to start 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.670
 download the program 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.159

 it's about downloading a file that 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.830
 we are going to have to execute 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.830
 let's wait a while 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.530

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.030
 the one that we're going to open this account 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.100
 after this video we are going to start 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.770
 make gameplays about him 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.920
 especially this channel is dedicated to 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.680
 nintendo ds videos so let's go to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.870
 walk with cigars like games of 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.220
 nintendo ds here where we can finish 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.220
 for execution 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.370
 Here we will configure it for how 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.590
 you want this one you want to access 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.700
 tutorials or record some parts of the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.240
 We will give you this screen but that 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.460
 that says rectangle on the screen here 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.920
 it's going to look like and we put it in 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.600
 our magnifying glass to find what screen 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.570
 they want to record or what piece they want 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.460
 record that this marking is marked 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:57.680
 but if not, if we can not modify it with 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:02.510
 this let's see let's go and we start here 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.510
 what we want to do great 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.270
 that marked piece is what 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.720
 will record while the program 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.780
 is thrilling but in this case if 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.150
 you want to record video games there 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.880
 to give the objective and they will come to direct x 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.880
 let's open a video game automatically 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.000
 we will look like 112 numbers in the 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.350
 corner to start recording in both 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.760
 you're the same let's see for this in 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.610
 general of legacy 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.730
 this is where they want to be saved from 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.730
 let the video be saved here 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.840
 here is to start recording the 12's 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.419
 between 12 we can change 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.050
 today we can let go thousands we can 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.360
 as we show so we put you if 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.319
 we want to hide the cursor if not 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.210
 we want the video to be seen what 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.789
 we hide because if we want it to be 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.620
 there were things like this we return to 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.220
 add import clicks and that for 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:10.870
 tutorial videos or is here tells us that 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:14.039
 the video and all this the sound the 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.949
 picture we can take pictures with this 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:22.919
 for example objective rectangle and 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.919
 we want to take an image 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.570
 let it be saved with suppose 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.570
 right now in the east 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.120
 and here it tells us that we want and that 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.810
 we want our format to come out 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:48.130
 image for example you put a 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:51.850
 the quality is marked and we give it in the 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.310
 lion was just taking the picture here says 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.820
 patrick a knows that he is remembered in 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.220
 the desktop and as you can see is the 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.270
 picture that we put is the picture that we 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.270
 took out the photo 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.430
 as we say here to press the v8 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.479
 we can be record or pay you but if 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.479
 let's record a piece 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:20.680
 to see this bit 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.680
 let's make the program 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.260
 this is the video 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:35.400
 how did you see that is the video I recorded it 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:37.950
 short as they came to see this well 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.630
 is configured to the Vatican with this what 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.090
 can use for different 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.920
 variations of what you want 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.130
 good that yes of everything take care and until the 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.130
 gold
