00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:15.050
 we actually in really cool pool 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.699
 you can build so you need a thing 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.909

 does not have to be and water like that 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.339
 First you build two fields so 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:36.969

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:43.300

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.700
 warm 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.810
 The warm out so then you build one 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.290
 a donor 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.290

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.710
 Research it is so smoky here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.180
 that is because the factual achieve 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.380
 I need me once briefly the floor a 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.009
 Wow me then I connect the same 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:44.130
 That's where I come from 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.130
 get in here 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.650
 you have everything connected 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.970
 rather that important that one 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.470
 Simply hauptmann here up there 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.539
 is clear you can do that if he's for it 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 build your house or as much as you buy 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.820
 could hide it better 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.920
 I just need to be open like 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.920
 see what you see what happens here 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.170
 I 'm extremely open 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.320
 then you build somewhere I do it 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 make a bit nicer say now 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.320
 me once 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 it should be if you somehow 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.070
 to build something in front of a house or should 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.560
 would have to be cool Buldern now 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.340
 of course, right and then build straight 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:51.810
 you have to donate with water buckets 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:56.550
 do that and then you need nh24 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.300
 is a pool of automatically here 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.400
 automatically full 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.450
 and if you fell inside now 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.460
 that at home we were the water 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.470
 yes, something just wanted to be 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.130
 Show if I think that's just cool 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.260
 is so automatic pool to from 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.550
 you do not have to down with the fire 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.230
 but you could have been extra 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.270
 without the foreword you could do it 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.470
 of course huge make huge pulleys 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.090
 they just have to boom so wild on all 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.310
 if you have direct connections 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.940
 be careful 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.210
 everything is done right 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.600
 ask what purpose did they 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.290
 I do not think so but have understood 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:49.780
 then just ask me in the comments 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:53.360
 if you like the video if you like it 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:59.530
 have something and ask what you have 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:03.110
 something should build the comments here 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.010
