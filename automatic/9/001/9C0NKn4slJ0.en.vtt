00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:14.330
 hey jude and fitness presents 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550
 ah 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.290
 fitness and health 6 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.649
 the best choice 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.739
 it depends on the person we have several 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.840
 possibilities we recommend two types of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.670
 training in general the first one is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.739
 long-lasting and low intensity 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.680
 where the person works approximately 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.829
 at 70 65 percent capacity 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.829
 maximum 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.610
 that option is a very very option 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.470
 traditional we have many years using 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 this type of training the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.280
 inconvenient is that it takes a lot 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 time many times we need to be more 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.010
 one hour and a half hour or two 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 cardiovascular hours and usually 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.640
 people do not have so much time 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.920
 then to a more modern option and more 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.410
 effective is to train with intervals of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.440
 High intensity high intervals 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.350
 intensity are more productive and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.910
 burn fat after training 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 after finishing the cardio session 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.560
 the body has to recharge all the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 energy that they burn in that session and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.810
 start to burn fat then it is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.820
 convenient to do it fasting and not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 have breakfast until one hour after 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 end the session to give time to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.100
 that the body uses its fat 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 reservation is a more modern training 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 much more efficient and you can also 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.340
 adapt to the person's time if the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.740
 person has little time we put it is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.530
 to that option if the person has a lot 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.080
 time we put the first option or 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.510
 we can even combine the ones one day 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.590
 a long week long duration with 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.869
 low intensity 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.799
 and another day a week alternating from 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.789
 High intensity 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.789
 and short duration 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.350
