real well or take it off down this
gridwall<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.750> put<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.530> I've<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
gridwall I put up here and I've got to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
gridwall I put up here and I've got to
extend<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.789> today<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.450> they're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
extend it on down today because they're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
extend it on down today because they're
almost<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.170> end<00:01:34.289> or<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.759> growing

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
almost to the end or just growing

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:45.770 
almost to the end or just growing
horizontally<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:42.000> bar<00:01:44.659> giant<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
horizontally now and some bar giant the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.020 
horizontally now and some bar giant the
work<00:01:45.960> tomato<00:01:46.350> plants

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.330 

I<00:01:49.119> think<00:01:49.750> that's<00:01:49.900> about<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:50.260> tall<00:01:50.470> as<00:01:50.650> they<00:01:50.799> yet

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.969 

but<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:54.520> see<00:01:54.790> how<00:01:54.970> I've<00:01:55.060> got<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.979> back

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
but you can see how I've got the back

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.890 
but you can see how I've got the back
wall<00:01:57.280> structured<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.150> grid<00:01:58.420> Wilson

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
wall structured with this grid Wilson

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.990 
wall structured with this grid Wilson
they<00:01:58.990> can<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.350> take<00:01:59.560> off<00:02:00.000> horizontally

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
they can just take off horizontally

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.060 
they can just take off horizontally
these<00:02:01.630> tomato<00:02:01.990> plants<00:02:02.409> are<00:02:02.530> actually<00:02:02.860> ones
