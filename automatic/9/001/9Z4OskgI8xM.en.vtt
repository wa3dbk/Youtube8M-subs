00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.679
 the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.199
 main welcome to the recipe book of the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.590
 winston today we are going to do 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:29.060
 little ribs in pasilla chile sauce 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.279
 this to generate the ingredients 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.620
 good for balanced baby ribs 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.640
 I have cooked lazcoz and in agua conagua 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.070
 onion salt is reduced development is 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.720
 reduced the water and now we are going to give them 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.600
 a freiberg we have green raw tomato 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:52.280
 one half of an onion one tooth of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.180
 big garlic two chili peppers 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.400
 a cube of chicken broth 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.400
 let's fry the rib 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.540
 let's put a little oil 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.540
 in rib 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 and let's wait until it starts to brown 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:16.000
 and here while in another pan 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.730
 let's put the chilies easy 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.780
 the chile pasilla has to be fried but 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.780
 it's a very fast process 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.320
 we are going to put the chiles pills in the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.320
 oil when it is already hot 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.030
 It's very big, I'm going to leave 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 and they're going to see that it's going to start 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.560
 inflate 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.560
 this we should leave around 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.010
 15 seconds nothing more hot oil 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.770
 change a little bit of color and start 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.620
 drop the aroma and like you start to 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 inflate 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.210
 loose color in the oil 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.560
 if the tablet is ready 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.710
 let's have it in the blender because it's going 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.710
 to be liquefied 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.390
 and there is a retinue left over here with the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.150
 what do we make of chile pasilla what are we going to 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.590
 add to incorporate the meat so that 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.590
 also have that flavor 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.550
 It already started 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.269
 and we 're going to leave it for a little while 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.269
 slow 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.519
 along with the chilies easy since already 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.330
 we learned we're going to kick out because we're going to 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.640
 also liquefy the tomatoes thus raw 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.360
 as he had told them at first the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.510
 Garlic 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.630
 half the onion and broth 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.580
 diced chicken 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.850
 we are going to add water so that 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.850
 I can 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.010
 this is to try that we do not stay very 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.510
 aguada has to be a kind of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.880
 mass 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.360
 I'm going to liquefy 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.360
 or not 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.590
 now let's add this here where 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.060
 we have the rib that is being asked 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.740
 I 'm going to lower the fire a little 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.580
 because it is very high 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.640
 come up so they can see how it is 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.800
 already opening the rib has a little 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.290
 of oil but the ideal is this so that 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.709
 be like a kind of pretty 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.709
 we add it 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.690
 and they do not lend us more than waiting 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.470
 boil and we are going to rectify salt since 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.470
 release the first boil in a moment 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.470
 we came back 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.749
 here we are already back and it started to boil 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.810
 so let's have a little salt 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.810
 nothing more for 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.620
 and here while you can see what I have in 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.450
 this command passing some remarkable 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.760
 images 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.640
 that's not part of the recipe simply 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.540
 nothing more to decorate right now 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.240
 let's prepare the dish 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.349
 in a moment we return 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.030
 here we also have to accompany some 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.010
 beans from the pot 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.550
 is very typical here in Mexico 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.710
 any region here we are in jalisco 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.300
 and we met them in a clay pot 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.300
 typical of tonalá here 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.310
 Well, here we have the dish 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.860
 finished are the little ribs are sauce 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.620
 from chile pasilla we put some nopales 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.590
 a roast roasted onions 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.200
 tortillas doraditas with beans of the 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.870
 pot and cheese sprinkled on a plate 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.220
 of mud very typical of here of tonalá 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.360
 jalisco 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.729
 well, it's all 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.770
 this number is more than telling them that 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:04.069
 comment that they subscribe that leave us is 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:07.810
 a request some comment and it 's all 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.810
