00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and everything to the head unit and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.370 
and everything to the head unit and then
for<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> install<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> Impala<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> also

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
for the install in the Impala we also

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.140 
for the install in the Impala we also
need<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.830> adapter<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> original

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
need this adapter because the original

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.580 
need this adapter because the original
Impala<00:01:27.600> stereo<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> 1.5<00:01:29.939> din<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
Impala stereo is a like a 1.5 din and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.120 
Impala stereo is a like a 1.5 din and
we're<00:01:31.590> Paul<00:01:31.890> installing<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> single<00:01:32.939> din<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
we're Paul installing a single din so as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.469 
we're Paul installing a single din so as
you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.759> adapter<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you can see this adapter is going to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.859 
you can see this adapter is going to
give<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> flush<00:01:37.560> mount<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.750> look

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
give you a flush mount so if we look

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
give you a flush mount so if we look
from<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> top<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> head<00:01:41.340> unit

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
from the top you can see the head unit

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060 
from the top you can see the head unit
syncs<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:43.200> way<00:01:43.290> back<00:01:43.470> into<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> adapter

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
syncs all the way back into the adapter

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
syncs all the way back into the adapter
so<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.909> basically<00:01:45.270> flush

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
so it's going to be basically flush

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.830 
so it's going to be basically flush
mounted<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.049> -<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.659> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
mounted with the - and this is the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.429 
mounted with the - and this is the
adapter<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.880> Metra<00:01:51.799> 99<00:01:53.030> -<00:01:54.030> 3300<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
adapter it's a Metra 99 - 3300 and I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.139 
adapter it's a Metra 99 - 3300 and I
think<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.130> actually<00:01:59.310> listed<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.790> eBay<00:01:59.969> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
think it's actually listed on eBay is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.080 
think it's actually listed on eBay is
for<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.890> isuzu<00:02:01.890> hombre<00:02:01.920> or<00:02:02.759> something<00:02:03.000> like

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
for a isuzu hombre or something like

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
for a isuzu hombre or something like
that<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:06.439> that's<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.680> adapter<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> want

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that so that's the adapter you want

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.670 
that so that's the adapter you want
that'll<00:02:08.610> fit<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.330> B<00:02:09.780> bodies

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that'll fit the the B bodies

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.289 
that'll fit the the B bodies
then<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> adapter<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.730> includes<00:02:14.150> this

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
then with the adapter it includes this

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.149 
then with the adapter it includes this
little<00:02:14.360> shell<00:02:14.870> which<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.260> basically<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.739> spacer

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
little shell which is basically a spacer

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.589 
little shell which is basically a spacer
here<00:02:16.189> if<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.549> didn't<00:02:16.819> want<00:02:16.969> this<00:02:17.120> flush<00:02:17.359> mount

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
here if you didn't want this flush mount

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.630 
here if you didn't want this flush mount
you'd<00:02:17.750> put<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.109> in<00:02:18.769> between<00:02:19.129> there<00:02:19.310> but<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.579> do

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
you'd put that in between there but I do

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.369 
you'd put that in between there but I do
want<00:02:19.909> to<00:02:19.939> flush<00:02:20.150> them<00:02:20.269> out<00:02:20.359> so<00:02:21.079> I'm<00:02:21.200> not<00:02:21.260> going

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
want to flush them out so I'm not going

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.750 
want to flush them out so I'm not going
to<00:02:21.439> be<00:02:21.530> using<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:24.189> and<00:02:25.189> then<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.430> also<00:02:25.579> need

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
to be using that and then you also need

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.039 
to be using that and then you also need
this<00:02:26.319> metro<00:02:27.319> wiring<00:02:27.680> harness<00:02:28.010> GM<00:02:29.260> 4:01<00:02:30.260> and

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
this metro wiring harness GM 4:01 and

looking<00:04:48.000> at<00:04:48.150> how<00:04:48.719> we<00:04:48.900> can<00:04:49.080> kind<00:04:49.469> of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
looking at how we can kind of

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.740 
looking at how we can kind of
conveniently<00:04:50.009> route<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.490> cable<00:04:51.000> all<00:04:51.689> the

conveniently route this cable all the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.270 
conveniently route this cable all the
way<00:04:51.900> out<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.379> somewhere<00:04:52.830> where<00:04:52.979> it's<00:04:53.099> going<00:04:53.219> to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
way out to somewhere where it's going to

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.629 
way out to somewhere where it's going to
get<00:04:53.430> good<00:04:53.969> XM<00:04:54.330> signal<00:04:55.190> alright<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.430> back

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
get good XM signal alright so back

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.219 
get good XM signal alright so back
outside<00:04:56.879> here<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.360> decided<00:04:57.780> where<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:57.990> wanted

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.230 
the X an antenna which is right here
pretty<00:05:00.690> much<00:05:00.870> dead<00:05:01.620> center<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.219> back<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.180> the

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
pretty much dead center and back of the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.290 
pretty much dead center and back of the
vehicle<00:05:04.370> nice<00:05:05.370> thing<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.669> if<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:05.849> put<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.120> there

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
vehicle nice thing is if I put it there

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.119 
vehicle nice thing is if I put it there
because<00:05:06.539> of<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.080> high<00:05:07.560> mount<00:05:07.770> bike<00:05:07.949> lane<00:05:08.099> I

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
because of the high mount bike lane I

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.490 
because of the high mount bike lane I
can't<00:05:08.430> see<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.729> from<00:05:08.909> inside<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:10.139> it's<00:05:10.319> totally

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
can't see it from inside so it's totally

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:20.649 
can't see it from inside so it's totally
transparent<00:05:12.289> cat<00:05:13.289> over<00:05:13.650> there<00:05:16.190> there<00:05:17.190> is

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.159 

anyway<00:05:21.659> so<00:05:21.719> if<00:05:22.020> we<00:05:22.139> look<00:05:22.349> in<00:05:22.469> the<00:05:22.590> trunk<00:05:24.169> what

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
anyway so if we look in the trunk what

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.490 
anyway so if we look in the trunk what
that<00:05:25.379> means<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:27.300> wire<00:05:27.840> comes<00:05:28.259> up

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
that means is that that wire comes up

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.300 
that means is that that wire comes up
and<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:31.500> know<00:05:31.590> but<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:31.830> definitely<00:05:31.979> do<00:05:32.250> a

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
and you know but I definitely do a

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.740 
and you know but I definitely do a
better<00:05:32.520> job<00:05:32.610> making<00:05:33.210> sure<00:05:33.270> nothing<00:05:33.539> gets

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
better job making sure nothing gets

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.899 
better job making sure nothing gets
pinched<00:05:34.169> here<00:05:34.409> but<00:05:34.560> it's<00:05:35.430> going<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.580> come<00:05:35.759> up

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
pinched here but it's going to come up

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.510 
pinched here but it's going to come up
and<00:05:36.090> I'm<00:05:36.210> going<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.360> get<00:05:36.479> some<00:05:36.659> zip<00:05:36.840> ties<00:05:36.870> but

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
and I'm going to get some zip ties but

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.350 
and I'm going to get some zip ties but
effectively<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.580> comes<00:05:38.759> down<00:05:38.909> here<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.210> then

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
effectively it comes down here and then

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.409 
effectively it comes down here and then
it's<00:05:39.479> going<00:05:39.569> to<00:05:39.629> run<00:05:39.810> along<00:05:39.960> this<00:05:40.259> wiring<00:05:40.560> here

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
it's going to run along this wiring here

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.110 
it's going to run along this wiring here
so<00:05:42.419> it<00:05:42.479> just<00:05:42.659> travels<00:05:43.080> with<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.849> with<00:05:44.849> that

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
so it just travels with the with that

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.480 
so it just travels with the with that
wiring<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:47.610> then<00:05:48.539> from<00:05:48.900> there<00:05:49.110> down<00:05:49.440> into<00:05:50.400> the

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
wiring and then from there down into the

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.700 
wiring and then from there down into the
vehicle<00:05:50.819> and<00:05:50.969> up<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.289> front<00:05:52.529> there

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
vehicle and up to the to the front there

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.730 
vehicle and up to the to the front there
so<00:05:53.520> that's<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:54.029> that's<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.080> plan<00:05:55.319> for<00:05:55.349> the<00:05:55.620> X

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
so that's the that's the plan for the X

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.339 
so that's the that's the plan for the X
I'm<00:05:55.949> antenna<00:05:56.719> would<00:05:57.719> have<00:05:57.839> been<00:05:57.930> a<00:05:57.960> lot<00:05:58.139> nicer

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
I'm antenna would have been a lot nicer

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.829 
I'm antenna would have been a lot nicer
to<00:05:58.560> run<00:05:58.830> this<00:05:58.979> cable<00:05:59.400> you<00:05:59.580> know<00:06:00.000> back<00:06:00.479> along

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:00.839 
to run this cable you know back along

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.769 
to run this cable you know back along
here<00:06:01.139> in<00:06:01.289> here<00:06:01.650> but<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.849> just<00:06:02.879> simply<00:06:03.479> does<00:06:03.750> not

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:03.779 
here in here but it just simply does not

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.079 
here in here but it just simply does not
fit<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.830> need<00:06:04.949> that<00:06:05.159> big<00:06:05.400> of<00:06:05.490> an<00:06:05.580> opening<00:06:05.909> so

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
fit you need that big of an opening so

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.119 
fit you need that big of an opening so
it's<00:06:06.240> got<00:06:06.389> to<00:06:06.479> be<00:06:06.509> zip<00:06:06.930> tied<00:06:07.169> up<00:06:07.319> here<00:06:07.560> some

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
it's got to be zip tied up here some

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.290 
it's got to be zip tied up here some
sort<00:06:08.310> of<00:06:08.599> seamless<00:06:09.599> sort<00:06:09.810> of<00:06:09.960> way<00:06:11.120> all<00:06:12.120> right

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
sort of seamless sort of way all right

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.939 
sort of seamless sort of way all right
so<00:06:12.449> I<00:06:12.479> picked<00:06:12.750> up<00:06:12.870> a<00:06:13.050> few<00:06:13.319> other<00:06:13.469> things<00:06:13.740> at

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
so I picked up a few other things at

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.320 
so I picked up a few other things at
RadioShack<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.819> are<00:06:14.909> going<00:06:15.029> to<00:06:15.089> be<00:06:15.180> useful

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
RadioShack that are going to be useful

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.290 
RadioShack that are going to be useful
for<00:06:15.599> this<00:06:15.810> install<00:06:16.849> first<00:06:17.849> of<00:06:17.969> all<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.180> can

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
for this install first of all you can

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.839 
for this install first of all you can
always<00:06:18.419> use<00:06:18.659> electrical<00:06:19.080> tape<00:06:19.639> when<00:06:20.639> making

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
always use electrical tape when making

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:21.920 
always use electrical tape when making
the<00:06:21.029> connection<00:06:21.449> between<00:06:21.599> these<00:06:21.870> two

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
the connection between these two

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.920 
the connection between these two
harnesses<00:06:22.560> but<00:06:23.180> heat<00:06:24.180> shrink<00:06:24.419> tubing<00:06:24.659> will

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
harnesses but heat shrink tubing will

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.629 
harnesses but heat shrink tubing will
peel<00:06:25.169> off<00:06:25.229> and<00:06:25.620> it's<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.770> lot<00:06:25.949> more<00:06:26.099> permanent

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
peel off and it's a lot more permanent

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.600 
peel off and it's a lot more permanent
so<00:06:26.849> I<00:06:27.089> got<00:06:28.020> some<00:06:28.319> different<00:06:29.099> sizes<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.490> heat

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
so I got some different sizes of heat

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.650 
so I got some different sizes of heat
shrink<00:06:29.819> tubing<00:06:30.120> and

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
shrink tubing and

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.060 
shrink tubing and
use<00:06:31.020> that<00:06:31.200> for<00:06:31.410> all<00:06:31.500> these<00:06:31.680> connections

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.450 

additionally<00:06:35.210> this<00:06:36.260> head<00:06:37.260> unit<00:06:37.590> has<00:06:37.800> a<00:06:37.830> aux

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
additionally this head unit has a aux

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.650 
additionally this head unit has a aux
port<00:06:39.000> where<00:06:39.240> is<00:06:39.360> it

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
port where is it

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.020 
port where is it
aux<00:06:39.930> port<00:06:40.320> on<00:06:40.470> the<00:06:40.560> back<00:06:40.710> there<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:41.280> so

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
aux port on the back there and so

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.960 
aux port on the back there and so
ideally<00:06:42.960> I'd<00:06:43.080> like<00:06:43.110> that<00:06:43.530> routed<00:06:44.010> you<00:06:44.100> know<00:06:44.220> so

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
ideally I'd like that routed you know so

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.330 
ideally I'd like that routed you know so
that<00:06:45.150> I<00:06:45.180> have<00:06:45.420> an<00:06:45.660> aux<00:06:46.200> in<00:06:46.470> my<00:06:46.590> -<00:06:46.800> you<00:06:47.250> know

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
that I have an aux in my - you know

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.460 
that I have an aux in my - you know
we're<00:06:47.730> gonna<00:06:47.820> have<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.060> USB<00:06:48.450> in<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:48.870> I'll

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
we're gonna have the USB in and I'll

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.530 
we're gonna have the USB in and I'll
have<00:06:49.590> an<00:06:49.680> oxen<00:06:50.070> as<00:06:50.190> well<00:06:50.370> and<00:06:51.090> so<00:06:51.330> I<00:06:51.360> got<00:06:51.510> a

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
have an oxen as well and so I got a

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.070 
have an oxen as well and so I got a
six-foot<00:06:52.080> just<00:06:53.040> 3.5<00:06:53.880> millimeter<00:06:54.510> stereo<00:06:54.810> -

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
six-foot just 3.5 millimeter stereo -

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.450 
six-foot just 3.5 millimeter stereo -
stereo<00:06:55.470> cable<00:06:56.120> from<00:06:57.120> Radio<00:06:57.750> Shack<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:59.370> was

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
stereo cable from Radio Shack that was

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.700 
stereo cable from Radio Shack that was
15<00:06:59.820> bucks<00:07:00.030> and<00:07:00.300> so<00:07:00.480> that's<00:07:00.720> going<00:07:00.990> to<00:07:01.050> you<00:07:01.680> know

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
15 bucks and so that's going to you know

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.110 
15 bucks and so that's going to you know
plug<00:07:02.010> in<00:07:02.160> here<00:07:02.430> and<00:07:02.610> then<00:07:02.700> I'll<00:07:02.820> route<00:07:03.000> the

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
plug in here and then I'll route the

you get control through the head unit

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.830 
you get control through the head unit
rather<00:07:21.240> than<00:07:21.450> through<00:07:21.600> the<00:07:21.630> mp3<00:07:22.200> player

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840
