on this but this is a v6 I know it what

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.620 
on this but this is a v6 I know it what
these<00:00:21.650> hubcaps

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.300 

the<00:00:26.630> interiors<00:00:27.170> in<00:00:27.199> great<00:00:27.500> shape<00:00:27.769> but<00:00:28.100> I'm

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
the interiors in great shape but I'm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.750 
the interiors in great shape but I'm
quite<00:00:28.519> sure<00:00:28.580> that<00:00:28.789> they<00:00:28.970> also<00:00:29.090> reupholster<00:00:29.840> it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.729 

well<00:00:34.760> YouTube<00:00:35.150> this<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:35.809> a<00:00:36.580> 1983<00:00:38.199> Ford<00:00:39.199> Mustang

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
well YouTube this is a 1983 Ford Mustang

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.920 
well YouTube this is a 1983 Ford Mustang
GLX<00:00:41.860> with<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.890> so-called<00:00:43.390> 31,000<00:00:44.390> miles<00:00:44.540> but

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
GLX with a so-called 31,000 miles but

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.399 
GLX with a so-called 31,000 miles but
since<00:00:45.229> this<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.589> five<00:00:45.830> digits<00:00:46.250> odometer

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
since this is the five digits odometer

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.299 
since this is the five digits odometer
it<00:00:48.409> likely<00:00:48.680> has<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.309> hundred<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.089> thirty<00:00:50.299> one<00:00:50.390> I

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
it likely has a hundred and thirty one I

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.590 
it likely has a hundred and thirty one I
don't<00:00:52.309> believe<00:00:52.519> it<00:00:52.790> has<00:00:52.909> any<00:00:53.089> more<00:00:53.269> than<00:00:53.420> that

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
don't believe it has any more than that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.829 
don't believe it has any more than that
because<00:00:53.780> if<00:00:53.989> this<00:00:54.080> car<00:00:54.290> had<00:00:54.320> over<00:00:54.699> 231<00:00:55.839> it

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
because if this car had over 231 it

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.410 
because if this car had over 231 it
would<00:00:57.080> have<00:00:57.170> been<00:00:57.320> an<00:00:58.070> absolute<00:00:58.850> box<00:00:59.119> and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
would have been an absolute box and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.680 
would have been an absolute box and
this<00:00:59.900> car<00:01:00.140> actually<00:01:01.129> isn't<00:01:01.670> considering<00:01:02.510> its

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
this car actually isn't considering its

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.560 
this car actually isn't considering its
age

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.929 

so

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
so

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.340 
so
there's<00:01:11.509> not<00:01:11.570> really<00:01:11.719> much<00:01:11.840> like<00:01:12.079> a<00:01:12.170> trick

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
there's not really much like a trick

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.469 
there's not really much like a trick
around<00:01:12.590> here<00:01:12.829> I<00:01:13.100> don't<00:01:13.579> know<00:01:13.700> it's<00:01:14.149> even<00:01:14.240> worth

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
around here I don't know it's even worth

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.520 
around here I don't know it's even worth
it<00:01:14.630> but<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.810> might<00:01:15.020> as<00:01:15.049> well<00:01:15.140> just<00:01:15.320> say<00:01:15.469> it

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
it but I might as well just say it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.240 
it but I might as well just say it
anyways<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:17.479> looks<00:01:17.539> like<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:18.170> an<00:01:18.289> insert<00:01:18.829> on

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
anyways it looks like it's an insert on

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.550 
anyways it looks like it's an insert on
top<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.700> dashboard<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:21.049> dashboard<00:01:21.079> is

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
top of the dashboard the dashboard is

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560 
top of the dashboard the dashboard is
supposed<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.860> be<00:01:22.009> soft<00:01:22.250> with<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.399> touch<00:01:22.640> they

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
supposed to be soft with the touch they

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.279 
supposed to be soft with the touch they
put<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.020> hard<00:01:24.380> plastic<00:01:24.649> for<00:01:25.369> protection

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
put in this hard plastic for protection

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.600 
put in this hard plastic for protection
so<00:01:27.289> possibily<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.920> dashboard<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.340> cracked

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
so possibily the dashboard is cracked

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.529 
so possibily the dashboard is cracked
I'm<00:01:28.850> not<00:01:29.000> sure

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
I'm not sure

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.710 
I'm not sure
so<00:01:29.780> I'm<00:01:29.869> not<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:30.170> remove<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.530> cover<00:01:31.720> so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
so I'm not going to remove that cover so

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.300 
so I'm not going to remove that cover so
pretty<00:01:33.140> much<00:01:33.289> straightforward<00:01:33.770> climate

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
pretty much straightforward climate

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.899 
pretty much straightforward climate

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
