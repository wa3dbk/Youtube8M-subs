00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hi folks I just wanted to put quick

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.070 
hi folks I just wanted to put quick
question<00:00:05.069> out<00:00:05.220> there<00:00:05.690> because<00:00:06.690> I'm<00:00:06.899> not

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
question out there because I'm not

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.810 
question out there because I'm not
really<00:00:07.440> sure<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.490> answer<00:00:08.610> myself<00:00:10.700> here<00:00:11.700> we

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
really sure of the answer myself here we

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.839 
really sure of the answer myself here we
aren't<00:00:12.090> new<00:00:12.269> mayor<00:00:12.570> again<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.830> put<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.700> on

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
aren't new mayor again I put one on

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.810 
aren't new mayor again I put one on
earlier<00:00:15.389> with<00:00:15.660> her<00:00:15.859> some<00:00:16.859> guys<00:00:17.100> stand<00:00:17.580> around

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
earlier with her some guys stand around

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.349 
earlier with her some guys stand around
in<00:00:18.529> weird<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.949> spacesuits<00:00:20.670> pointing<00:00:21.240> up

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
in weird kind of spacesuits pointing up

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.870 
in weird kind of spacesuits pointing up
to<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.570> sky<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.900> people<00:00:24.900> were<00:00:25.019> saying<00:00:25.320> now

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
to the sky but people were saying now

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.820 
to the sky but people were saying now
I've<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.330> both<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> these<00:00:27.869> frames<00:00:28.289> from<00:00:28.590> two

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I've got both of these frames from two

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.820 
I've got both of these frames from two
different<00:00:29.039> cameras<00:00:29.990> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.320> same<00:00:31.560> base

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
different cameras of the same base

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.590 
different cameras of the same base
they're<00:00:32.460> obviously<00:00:32.940> runs<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.660> distance<00:00:34.410> away

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
they're obviously runs a distance away

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.639 
they're obviously runs a distance away
compared<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:37.219> now<00:00:39.350> let's<00:00:40.350> just

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
compared to the other now let's just

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.360 
compared to the other now let's just
step<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.250> forward<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:42.770> assumably<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
step it forward as assumably what is the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.069 
step it forward as assumably what is the
moon<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> sun's<00:00:45.059> gone<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.450> unless<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.899> see

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
moon the sun's gone down unless you see

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.319 
moon the sun's gone down unless you see
the<00:00:46.200> moon<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.500> coming<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.969> now<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:49.500> previous

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
the moon is coming up now in previous

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
the moon is coming up now in previous
debates<00:00:51.329> when<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.320> suffer<00:00:52.649> object

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
debates when when they suffer object

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.869 
debates when when they suffer object
appears<00:00:53.640> around<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:55.070> people<00:00:56.070> say<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.610> can't

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
appears around now people say it can't

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.170 
appears around now people say it can't
be<00:00:56.969> an<00:00:57.090> object<00:00:57.739> because<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.969> camera<00:00:59.969> lens

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
be an object because it's camera lens

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.310 
be an object because it's camera lens
flare<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> overlaps<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.160> building

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
flare because it overlaps the building

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.890 
flare because it overlaps the building
so<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.830> object<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.729> yet<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.750> an

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so it's not an object but yet this is an

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380 
so it's not an object but yet this is an
object<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> still<00:01:08.400> overlaps<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
object and that still overlaps the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
object and that still overlaps the
building<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.990> that's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.650> camera<00:01:11.070> lens

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
building and that's not camera lens

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
building and that's not camera lens
flare<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.450> argue<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.020> mean<00:01:13.530> obviously

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
flare they would argue I mean obviously

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
flare they would argue I mean obviously
the<00:01:14.280> fact<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> overlaps<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.270> building

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the fact that it overlaps the building

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
the fact that it overlaps the building
its<00:01:15.780> flare<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.950> doesn't<00:01:17.280> stop<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> from

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
its flare but it doesn't stop it from

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
its flare but it doesn't stop it from
being<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.150> object<00:01:19.100> let's<00:01:20.100> step<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.830> now<00:01:22.830> as

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
being an object let's step it on now as

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.399 
being an object let's step it on now as
you<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:24.000> overlapped<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.259> building

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
you see it overlapped to be the building

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.100 
you see it overlapped to be the building
and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> object<00:01:29.130> comes<00:01:29.369> through<00:01:30.110> yes

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and then this object comes through yes

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
and then this object comes through yes
it<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.619> overlaps<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> building<00:01:32.700> no<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.299> not

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it over overlaps the building no I'm not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
it over overlaps the building no I'm not
sad<00:01:33.659> using<00:01:33.960> camera<00:01:34.770> flare<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.400> could<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
sad using camera flare it could be it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
sad using camera flare it could be it
could<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.840> camera<00:01:37.200> flare<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> argument

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
could be camera flare but the argument

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929 
could be camera flare but the argument
that<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> overlaps<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.710> building<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.790> it's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that it overlaps the building so it's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
that it overlaps the building so it's
obviously<00:01:42.390> got<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.869> camera<00:01:43.259> flare<00:01:43.500> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
obviously got to be camera flare it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.130 
obviously got to be camera flare it's
not<00:01:44.399> very<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:46.759> because<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.240> does<00:01:48.540> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
not very good one because so does so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.069 
not very good one because so does so
does<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.619> other<00:01:49.970> object<00:01:50.970> probably<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.840> moon

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.810 

as<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.219> does<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.640> well

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
as you can see that does as well

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.359 
as you can see that does as well
therefore<00:01:57.659> move<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> camera

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
therefore move over to the have a camera

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.700 
therefore move over to the have a camera
and<00:02:02.780> step<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.990> forward<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and step that forward this is this the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.100 
and step that forward this is this the
moon<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> running<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> same<00:02:09.420> sequence

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
moon it is running at the same sequence

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.630 
moon it is running at the same sequence
time<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.739> showed<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.430> other

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
time as I just showed you on the other

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.200 
time as I just showed you on the other
camera

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
camera

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.740 
camera
as<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.170> see<00:02:14.970> that's<00:02:15.970> what<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.300> find<00:02:16.570> curious

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
as you see that's what I find curious

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.570 
as you see that's what I find curious
because<00:02:17.320> it's<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.340> two<00:02:18.870> objects<00:02:20.580> two

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
because it's like this two objects two

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.640 
because it's like this two objects two
objects<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.330> shock<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.870> same<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.320> there<00:02:23.500> was

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
objects in shock the same as there was

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.890 
objects in shock the same as there was
around<00:02:23.950> their<00:02:24.330> camera<00:02:25.330> flare<00:02:25.600> at<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.840> bottom

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
around their camera flare at the bottom

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.140 
around their camera flare at the bottom
of<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.560> two<00:02:27.370> objects<00:02:28.260> strange<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.910> said

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
of it and two objects strange as I said
