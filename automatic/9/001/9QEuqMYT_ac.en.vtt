the<00:01:41.240> wooden<00:01:41.599> rails<00:01:41.899> here<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.470> believe<00:01:43.190> if<00:01:43.550> I'm

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the wooden rails here I believe if I'm

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.389 
the wooden rails here I believe if I'm
not<00:01:43.819> mistaken<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.599> made<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:45.020> Michigan<00:01:45.890> Michigan

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
not mistaken I made of Michigan Michigan

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.990 
not mistaken I made of Michigan Michigan
white<00:01:46.970> ash<00:01:47.349> with<00:01:48.349> some<00:01:48.619> linseed<00:01:49.369> oil<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:49.880> them

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
white ash with some linseed oil on them

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.990 
white ash with some linseed oil on them
I<00:01:50.179> think<00:01:50.599> is<00:01:50.720> what<00:01:50.869> they<00:01:50.989> do<00:01:51.849> they<00:01:52.849> have

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
I think is what they do they have

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.449 
I think is what they do they have
different<00:01:53.349> washing<00:01:54.349> systems<00:01:54.860> or<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.250> could

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
different washing systems or you could

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.249 
different washing systems or you could
go<00:01:55.670> without<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.209> lashing<00:01:56.630> system<00:01:57.020> if<00:01:57.140> you

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
go without the lashing system if you

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.460 
go without the lashing system if you
want<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.950> got<00:01:58.429> it<00:01:58.880> with<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.229> pretty

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
want I got it with and it's a pretty

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.249 
want I got it with and it's a pretty
pretty<00:02:01.459> fine<00:02:01.759> setup<00:02:02.239> I<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.869> lot<00:02:03.020> it's

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
pretty fine setup I like it a lot it's

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.680 
pretty fine setup I like it a lot it's
pretty<00:02:03.470> simple<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.729> we'll<00:02:04.940> go<00:02:05.119> through<00:02:05.149> that

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
pretty simple and we'll go through that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.990 
pretty simple and we'll go through that

you can see the lashing system coming

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.440 
you can see the lashing system coming
off<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.420> back<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.980> which<00:03:01.120> have<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> few

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
off the back of that which have a few

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.180 
off the back of that which have a few
different<00:03:02.840> names<00:03:03.020> but<00:03:03.350> they're<00:03:03.560> runners<00:03:03.860> if

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190

you will they do a pretty good job they

you will they do a pretty good job they
got<00:03:08.120> these<00:03:09.100> brass<00:03:10.100> loops<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> webbing

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
got these brass loops with the webbing

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.380 
got these brass loops with the webbing
coming<00:03:12.530> off<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.980> tied<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.580> back<00:03:13.790> which

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
coming off of it tied in the back which

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.300 
coming off of it tied in the back which
is<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.600> lashing<00:03:15.140> system<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.709> hold<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.070> gear

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
is the lashing system to hold you gear

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.750 
is the lashing system to hold you gear
down<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:17.480> don't<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.200> have<00:03:18.380> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
down you don't have to have that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.330 
down you don't have to have that
typically<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:20.540> these<00:03:20.720> side<00:03:21.110> runners<00:03:21.620> that

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
typically just these side runners that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.240 
typically just these side runners that
go<00:03:22.550> up<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.060> sides<00:03:23.989> eventually<00:03:24.650> up<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.040> top

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
go up the sides eventually up to the top

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.620 
go up the sides eventually up to the top
of<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.520> sled<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.060> then<00:03:26.540> out<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.870> front

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
of the sled and then out the front

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.560 
of the sled and then out the front
sometimes<00:03:29.630> it's<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.930> same<00:03:31.030> piece<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.209> cordage

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
sometimes it's the same piece of cordage

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.259 
sometimes it's the same piece of cordage
that<00:03:32.780> comes<00:03:33.019> out<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.370> hump<00:03:34.820> line<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.180> you

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
that comes out to the hump line that you

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.500 
that comes out to the hump line that you
pull<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.920> sometimes<00:03:36.920> they're<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:38.299> this

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
pull on sometimes they're not in this

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.320 
pull on sometimes they're not in this
case<00:03:38.799> they're<00:03:39.799> not<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.730> we'll<00:03:40.880> get<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.209> know

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
case they're not and we'll get to know

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.800 
case they're not and we'll get to know
again<00:03:41.720> just<00:03:42.440> like<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.830> back<00:03:43.100> has<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.269> brass

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
again just like the back has that brass

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.610 
again just like the back has that brass
loop<00:03:45.459> they<00:03:46.459> go<00:03:46.670> all<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.690> way<00:03:47.720> up<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.080> side<00:03:48.350> at

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
loop they go all the way up the side at

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.400 
loop they go all the way up the side at
each<00:03:48.890> runner<00:03:49.780> allows<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.170> weave<00:03:51.380> your

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
each runner allows you to weave your

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.039 
each runner allows you to weave your
lashing<00:03:52.100> system<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:53.060> hold<00:03:53.209> all<00:03:53.480> your<00:03:53.510> gear<00:03:53.900> in

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
lashing system to hold all your gear in

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.970 
lashing system to hold all your gear in
place<00:03:54.579> and<00:03:55.579> again<00:03:55.940> it's<00:03:56.450> got<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.840> runners<00:03:57.769> on

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
place and again it's got the runners on

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.400 
place and again it's got the runners on
both<00:03:58.220> sides<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.940> go<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.870> length<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.320> the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
both sides that go the length of the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.490 
both sides that go the length of the
slug<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.610> once<00:04:01.790> your<00:04:02.030> lashing<00:04:02.570> gets<00:04:03.140> all<00:04:03.380> the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
slug so once your lashing gets all the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.819 
slug so once your lashing gets all the
way<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.980> front<00:04:05.230> they've<00:04:06.230> got<00:04:08.410> these<00:04:09.410> teeth

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
way to the front they've got these teeth

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.530 
way to the front they've got these teeth
hair<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.579> wear<00:04:10.820> put<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.660> strap<00:04:11.989> through<00:04:12.019> and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
hair to wear put the strap through and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.840 
hair to wear put the strap through and
cinch<00:04:14.540> all<00:04:14.720> your<00:04:14.930> stuff<00:04:15.200> down<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.489> doesn't

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
cinch all your stuff down and it doesn't

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.300 
cinch all your stuff down and it doesn't
pull<00:04:17.030> back<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.450> other<00:04:17.600> way<00:04:18.070> that's<00:04:19.070> pretty

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
pull back the other way that's pretty

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.210 
pull back the other way that's pretty
fancy<00:04:19.870> works<00:04:20.870> well<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.440> haven't<00:04:21.859> had<00:04:22.010> any

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
fancy works well I haven't had any

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.150 
fancy works well I haven't had any
issues<00:04:22.430> with<00:04:22.669> it<00:04:22.970> yet<00:04:23.320> all<00:04:24.320> right<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.979> then<00:04:25.130> on
