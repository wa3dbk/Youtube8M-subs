00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
30 times now this is where they call the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
30 times now this is where they call the
skinner<00:01:17.939> blend<00:01:18.150> after<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.780> roll<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.259> 20<00:01:19.530> 30

skinner blend after you roll for 20 30

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
skinner blend after you roll for 20 30
times<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.280> depends<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> how<00:01:20.850> big<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.240> your

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
times that depends to how big is your

clay<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.990> something<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.530> from

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
clay you get something like this from

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.700 
clay you get something like this from
one<00:01:23.939> color<00:01:24.210> gradually<00:01:25.140> turning<00:01:25.380> into<00:01:25.619> another

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
one color gradually turning into another

to do is fold them again like what we
did<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:48.740> horizontally<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.130> i'm

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
did just now horizontally and now i'm

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
did just now horizontally and now i'm
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.780> roll<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:52.020> vertically<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
going to just roll them vertically to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.209 
going to just roll them vertically to
give<00:01:53.490> me<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> longest<00:01:54.540> skinner<00:01:54.840> blend<00:01:55.189> then<00:01:56.189> i

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
give me a longest skinner blend then i

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.170 
give me a longest skinner blend then i
start<00:01:56.759> rolling

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
start rolling

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.790 
start rolling
to<00:01:58.330> get<00:01:58.750> myself<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.470> really<00:01:59.980> why<00:02:00.160> sit<00:02:00.670> alone

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
to get myself a really why sit alone

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.690 
to get myself a really why sit alone
oops<00:02:02.800> oh<00:02:05.550> they<00:02:06.550> got<00:02:06.730> stick<00:02:06.970> together<00:02:08.700> yep

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
oops oh they got stick together yep

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.840 
oops oh they got stick together yep
that's<00:02:10.090> how<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.570> looks<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.080> from<00:02:11.980> read<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
that's how that looks like from read the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.250 
that's how that looks like from read the
pinkish<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.600> then<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.320> white<00:02:14.940> yep<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.230> is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
pinkish and then to white yep so this is

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.410 
pinkish and then to white yep so this is
how<00:02:17.620> my<00:02:17.890> skinner<00:02:18.250> blend<00:02:18.490> that's<00:02:18.880> like<00:02:19.090> after<00:02:19.390> I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
how my skinner blend that's like after I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.790 
how my skinner blend that's like after I
wrote<00:02:19.660> them<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.050> my<00:02:20.170> pasta<00:02:20.350> machine

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
wrote them in my pasta machine

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.310 
wrote them in my pasta machine
vertically<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.060> graduations<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.080> color

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
vertically see that graduations of color

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.730 
vertically see that graduations of color
from<00:02:24.100> red<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.610> white<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:26.410> I'm<00:02:26.470> going<00:02:26.650> to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
from red to white and now I'm going to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.320 
from red to white and now I'm going to
tell<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:26.950> guys<00:02:27.160> how<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.430> make<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.760> tree<00:02:28.090> color

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
tell you guys how to make a tree color

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.240 
tell you guys how to make a tree color
skinner<00:02:28.750> blend<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:29.470> color<00:02:29.680> skin<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.130> line

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
skinner blend and for color skin of line

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
skinner blend and for color skin of line
yeah<00:02:30.489> just<00:02:30.730> ignore<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.209> this<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:31.900> some

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
yeah just ignore this this is just some

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.860 
yeah just ignore this this is just some
tea<00:02:32.410> tree<00:02:32.650> mask<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.310> put<00:02:33.550> on<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.630> forehead

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
tea tree mask that I put on my forehead

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.990 
tea tree mask that I put on my forehead
so<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.739> true<00:02:35.980> color<00:02:36.250> skinner<00:02:36.850> blend

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
so this is the true color skinner blend

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.660 
so this is the true color skinner blend
oh<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.840> needs<00:02:37.959> just<00:02:38.140> three<00:02:38.650> different<00:02:39.130> color

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
oh it needs just three different color

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.030 
oh it needs just three different color
clay<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.270> cut<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.600> into<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.140> shape<00:02:41.830> of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
clay and cut that into this shape of

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.800 
clay and cut that into this shape of
course<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.640> have<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.820> make<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.239> almost<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
course you have to make that almost the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.140 
course you have to make that almost the
same<00:02:43.989> size<00:02:44.050> my<00:02:44.590> drawing<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:44.980> pretty<00:02:45.370> rough<00:02:45.850> sir

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
same size my drawing is pretty rough sir

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.540 
same size my drawing is pretty rough sir
yeah<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.780> make<00:02:47.050> them<00:02:47.200> into<00:02:47.410> one<00:02:47.800> two<00:02:48.250> tree

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
yeah just make them into one two tree

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.460 
yeah just make them into one two tree
and<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> shape<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.300> this<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.900> course<00:02:50.380> you

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
and in the shape of this of course you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.750 
and in the shape of this of course you
have<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.620> make<00:02:50.860> them<00:02:51.010> into<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> same<00:02:51.489> size

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
have to make them into the same size

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.120 
have to make them into the same size
hopefully<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.780> entry<00:02:53.290> make<00:02:53.739> them<00:02:53.890> into

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
hopefully the one entry make them into

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.030 
hopefully the one entry make them into
the<00:02:54.250> same<00:02:54.670> size<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.630> triangle<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.560> two<00:02:56.800> is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
the same size of triangle the two is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.340 
the same size of triangle the two is
slightly<00:02:57.459> bigger<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.180> hope<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.050> makes<00:02:59.260> sense

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
slightly bigger I hope that makes sense

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.620 
slightly bigger I hope that makes sense
so<00:03:00.250> what<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.489> do<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.730> basically<00:03:01.120> really

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
so what you do is basically really

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.570 
so what you do is basically really
simple<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.080> just<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.709> what<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:02.950> did<00:03:03.190> just<00:03:03.459> now

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
simple you just do what I did just now

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.050 
simple you just do what I did just now
just<00:03:03.820> fold<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.570> tree<00:03:04.810> colors<00:03:05.549> together<00:03:06.549> like

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
just fold the tree colors together like

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.150 
just fold the tree colors together like
that<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.600> then<00:03:08.049> just<00:03:08.080> roll<00:03:08.560> them<00:03:08.739> into<00:03:08.950> your

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
that and then just roll them into your

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.830 
that and then just roll them into your
pasta<00:03:09.549> machine<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:09.970> keep<00:03:10.209> them<00:03:10.390> continue

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
pasta machine and keep them continue

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.990 
pasta machine and keep them continue
doing<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.400> would<00:03:12.549> after<00:03:12.880> you

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
doing that and then you would after you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.759 
doing that and then you would after you
see<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.269> graduations<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.080> color<00:03:14.320> from

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
see of graduations of color from

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.850 
see of graduations of color from
whatever<00:03:15.370> color<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.000> have<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> tree

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
whatever color you have like the tree

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.800 
whatever color you have like the tree
graduations<00:03:17.860> color<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.430> then<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.269> you

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
graduations color and then you just you

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.070 
graduations color and then you just you
can<00:03:19.989> stop<00:03:20.350> oh<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.220> want<00:03:21.459> your<00:03:21.730> clay<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.690> be

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
can stop oh if you want your clay to be

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.500 
can stop oh if you want your clay to be
long<00:03:23.350> instead<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:24.040> white<00:03:24.580> then<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.360> do

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
long instead of white then you just do

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.940 
long instead of white then you just do
what<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.690> did<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.080> then<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.350> just<00:03:26.530> pull<00:03:26.799> them

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
what I did and then you just pull them

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.610 
what I did and then you just pull them
together<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.610> then<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:28.840> roll<00:03:29.230> them<00:03:29.410> into

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
together and then just roll them into

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.940 
together and then just roll them into
your<00:03:29.920> pasta<00:03:30.310> machine<00:03:30.610> vertically<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.690> now

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
your pasta machine vertically and now

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.170 
your pasta machine vertically and now
I'm<00:03:32.950> going<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.190> tell<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.400> guys<00:03:33.519> how<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:34.000> the

I'm going to tell you guys how to do the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.080 
I'm going to tell you guys how to do the
full<00:03:34.450> color<00:03:34.750> skinner<00:03:35.110> blend<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.850> what

you're going to do just cut the four
different<00:03:38.920> colors<00:03:39.100> into<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:40.030> shape<00:03:40.360> four

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
different colors into this shape four

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.440 
different colors into this shape four
triangles<00:03:41.680> basically<00:03:42.250> where<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.850> one<00:03:43.180> and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
triangles basically where the one and

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.900 
triangles basically where the one and
the<00:03:43.480> four<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.440> same<00:03:44.709> size<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.250> triangle

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
the four is the same size of triangle

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.509 
the four is the same size of triangle
and<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.750> two<00:03:46.989> entry<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.890> same<00:03:48.100> size<00:03:48.310> of

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
and the two entry is the same size of

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.000 
and the two entry is the same size of
triangle<00:03:49.000> basically<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.660> entry<00:03:50.440> will<00:03:50.980> be

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
triangle basically to entry will be

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.490 
triangle basically to entry will be
bigger<00:03:51.610> than<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.150> one<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.600> four<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.140> hope<00:03:53.380> that

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
bigger than the one and four I hope that

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.710 
bigger than the one and four I hope that
makes<00:03:53.799> sense<00:03:53.950> basically<00:03:54.640> no<00:03:55.329> matter<00:03:55.510> how<00:03:55.660> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
makes sense basically no matter how the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.539 
makes sense basically no matter how the
colors<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.410> do<00:03:56.650> for<00:03:56.860> your<00:03:56.950> skin<00:03:57.100> of<00:03:57.250> land

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
colors you do for your skin of land

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.030 
colors you do for your skin of land
always<00:03:58.060> remember<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.660> last<00:03:58.959> color<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.860> color

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
always remember the last color the color

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.880 
always remember the last color the color
at<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.370> end<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:01.030> always<00:04:01.320> small<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.709> one

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
at the end is always small and the one

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.280 
at the end is always small and the one
in<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.160> middle<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.670> big<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.840> do<00:04:04.989> five

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
in the middle is big like you do five

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.920 
in the middle is big like you do five
color<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:06.070> color<00:04:06.250> one<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.940> five<00:04:07.329> will<00:04:07.660> be<00:04:07.780> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
color the color one and five will be the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.980 
color the color one and five will be the
small<00:04:08.440> triangle<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:10.120> two<00:04:10.389> tree<00:04:10.720> and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
small triangle and the two tree and

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.840 
small triangle and the two tree and
what<00:04:11.140> will<00:04:11.410> be<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.620> big<00:04:11.830> triangle<00:04:12.520> where<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
what will be the big triangle where the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.430 
what will be the big triangle where the
two<00:04:13.060> three<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.420> four<00:04:13.660> will<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.930> same<00:04:14.140> size

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
two three and four will be the same size

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.520 
two three and four will be the same size
and<00:04:14.650> one<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.430> five<00:04:15.670> will<00:04:15.850> be<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.060> same<00:04:16.270> size
