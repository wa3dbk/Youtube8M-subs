the<00:00:05.879> short<00:00:06.150> answer<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.720> question<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.470> far

the short answer to this question is far

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
enough we find people spend a lot of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.890 
enough we find people spend a lot of
time<00:00:10.800> asking<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> range<00:00:11.880> before<00:00:12.509> they

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
time asking about the range before they

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.020

buy<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> bike<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:14.309> never<00:00:14.490> hear<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.820> it

again<00:00:15.210> once<00:00:15.570> they<00:00:15.690> actually<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.520> we<00:00:17.520> just

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
again once they actually get it we just

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.279 
again once they actually get it we just
don't<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.390> stories<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.779> people

hours now this is where it gets tricky

hours now this is where it gets tricky
because<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.680> many<00:01:07.799> variables<00:01:08.189> but

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
because there are so many variables but

because there are so many variables but
on<00:01:09.330> average<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.560> expect<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.250> between

15 and 25 watt hours per mile this
number<00:01:16.439> fluctuates<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.790> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
number fluctuates so much because of

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
number fluctuates so much because of
differences<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.450> terrain<00:01:19.100> rider-waite

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
many watt hours you will use you can use

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.539 
many watt hours you will use you can use
that<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.759> calculate<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.299> expected<00:01:30.810> range<00:01:31.549> we

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that to calculate your expected range we

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.999 
that to calculate your expected range we
find<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> 18<00:01:33.420> watt<00:01:33.659> hours<00:01:33.960> per<00:01:33.990> mile<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
find that 18 watt hours per mile is the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.490 
find that 18 watt hours per mile is the
most<00:01:35.220> common<00:01:35.640> average<00:01:35.939> across<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.450> board<00:01:36.689> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
most common average across the board so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
most common average across the board so
that's<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.860> we'll<00:01:37.979> use<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.520> predict<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that's what we'll use to predict the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.469 
that's what we'll use to predict the

because they can so to be conservative

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
because they can so to be conservative
we<00:02:07.170> generally<00:02:07.590> advise<00:02:07.860> people<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> expect

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
we generally advise people to expect

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
we generally advise people to expect
about<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> same<00:02:09.629> range<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> 48<00:02:10.709> volt

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
about the same range out of a 48 volt

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.020 
about the same range out of a 48 volt
battery<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.819> standard<00:02:12.390> 36<00:02:12.930> volt<00:02:13.140> battery

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
battery as a standard 36 volt battery

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.760 
battery as a standard 36 volt battery
so<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.240> assume<00:02:15.330> you're<00:02:15.660> using<00:02:15.840> 24<00:02:16.500> watt

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
so if we assume you're using 24 watt

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.730 
so if we assume you're using 24 watt
hours<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.100> mile<00:02:17.490> then<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> 48<00:02:18.900> volt<00:02:19.350> battery

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
hours a mile then the 48 volt battery

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.330 
hours a mile then the 48 volt battery
should<00:02:19.830> give<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.430> about<00:02:20.640> 20<00:02:20.940> miles
