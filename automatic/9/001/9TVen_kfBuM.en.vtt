thing it sounds amazing if you've ever
actually<00:03:37.890> used<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.610> x5<00:03:38.940> cards

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
actually used one of the x5 cards

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.630 
actually used one of the x5 cards
instead<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> built-in<00:03:40.080> audio<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:41.310> you've

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
instead of the built-in audio you you've

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.190 
instead of the built-in audio you you've
really<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.060> recognize<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> mean<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.080> they

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
really you recognize that I mean it they

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280 
really you recognize that I mean it they
sound<00:03:43.700> absolutely<00:03:44.700> awesome<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.900> much<00:03:46.080> better

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
sound absolutely awesome so much better

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.750 
sound absolutely awesome so much better
than<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.560> built-in<00:03:46.739> audio<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:47.610> also

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
than the built-in audio so it's also

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.490 
than the built-in audio so it's also
really<00:03:48.239> nice<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.570> easy<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.989> get<00:03:49.080> into<00:03:49.380> this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
really nice and easy to get into this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.940 
really nice and easy to get into this

around the case

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.540 
around the case
I<00:04:09.750> mean<00:04:10.140> sure<00:04:10.320> you've<00:04:10.500> seen<00:04:10.650> custom<00:04:11.040> jobs<00:04:11.280> that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
I mean sure you've seen custom jobs that

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.620 
I mean sure you've seen custom jobs that
are<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.850> are<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:12.000> little<00:04:12.180> bit<00:04:12.269> better<00:04:12.420> than

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
are that are a little bit better than

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.390 
are that are a little bit better than
this<00:04:12.720> but<00:04:12.870> typically<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:14.100> know<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.220> don't

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
this but typically you know you don't

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.509 
this but typically you know you don't
