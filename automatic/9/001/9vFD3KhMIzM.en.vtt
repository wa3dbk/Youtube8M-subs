00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
can get out of this and this is most

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
can get out of this and this is most
likely<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:15.990> my<00:00:16.199> last<00:00:16.410> attempt<00:00:17.400> just

because<00:00:17.850> I'm<00:00:17.940> pretty<00:00:18.060> tired<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
because I'm pretty tired right now and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230 
because I'm pretty tired right now and
I've<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> host<00:00:19.920> which<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.820> extra

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240

I've got a host which is an extra
advantage<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.529> guess<00:00:22.710> especially<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.220> black

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
advantage I guess especially in black

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.179 
advantage I guess especially in black
ops<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.760> since<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> knife<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.660> bad<00:00:25.189> host

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
ops you since the knife is so bad host

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
ops you since the knife is so bad host
really<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:26.880> gives<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> upper

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
really it really gives you the upper

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.589

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
advantage and let's see if I can just

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.110

I might need to switch it up to the
pecan<00:02:13.280> pie<00:02:13.400> knives<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.910> little<00:02:14.360> bit<00:02:14.450> more<00:02:14.660> just

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
pecan pie knives a little bit more just

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.740 
pecan pie knives a little bit more just
cuz<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.250> blitz<00:02:16.489> knife<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.820> good<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:17.390> times

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
cuz like a blitz knife is good at times

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.110 
cuz like a blitz knife is good at times
but<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.620> common<00:02:18.950> types<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.340> little<00:02:19.910> bit<00:02:20.000> more

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
but the common types a little bit more

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
but the common types a little bit more
consistent<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.660> think<00:02:20.900> that's<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.560> some

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
consistent I think that's in some

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.430 
consistent I think that's in some
situations<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.700> give<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.360> up<00:02:23.570> if<00:02:24.290> you're
