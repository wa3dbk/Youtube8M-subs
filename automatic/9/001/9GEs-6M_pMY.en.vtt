00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 a salute to all the friends of jeans 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.839
 china a.it new exclusive boxing 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.990
 Italian for you readers this time 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.150
 we will see first contact with the kubot x11 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 a device that is characterized by 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.350
 a specific package that is not much 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.150
 very updated but at some points of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.580
 view is very interesting also e 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.789
 especially because what we are about to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 see is the most waterproof device 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.199
 thin in the world with peak certification 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 68 obviously the water resistance 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.309
 will be verified in the review 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.020
 thank you first of all change e 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.579
 puntocom simple beads that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 available on the store or at a price 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.760
 discounted for all collectors thanks 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 to the discount code that you will find 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 in the article linked in description 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.450
 let's see immediately an unboxing box 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 black on which the name of the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.219
 producer is another written keep in 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.680
 touch device that we will see in a while 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.719
 under this tray on which they come 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.300
 show some features 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.489
 structural features of the smartphone 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.920
 here too you see the insertion 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.539
 of the micro sd and the sim we find the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 second protective film in addition to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.299
 the one we find already applied a 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 User manual which is in English is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 multilingual but it is not even present 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 the Italian here we find also 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.580
 the Italian a charger already in 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.640
 European format from a camper is a cable 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.159
 usb micro usb finally we have it 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 I show was already installed let's say 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.220
 on the device a protective cover in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.200
 soft rubber we eat to improve 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.210
 a little the accessories supplied by 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.619
 kubot x11 which is not however 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.799
 very complete as we have 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.869
 seen missing the device earphones 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 which as you can see a little square I use a little 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.630
 tile but all in all it does not seem 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.160
 be bad to obviously check the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.330
 water resistance also because here 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.000
 I see the micro USB slot and discovered it not 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.260
 we have a door as they are 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.780
 present on the other side but let's go to 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.680
 see the structure of the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.280
 smartphone the kubot x11 measures 151.3 x 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.150
 75 x 65 mm thick for a weight 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.209
 total 2850 milan battery loses 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.400
 included that is not removable from of 182 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.870
 grams therefore a weight certainly not 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 reduced but I must tell the truth 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.860
 at least not from these first impressions 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.020
 it seems to me to be exaggerated above all 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.270
 because probably the distribution 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.590
 of the same very very good on this 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.970
 device 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.590
 we see in the structure on the side 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.120
 left we find the power button of 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.000
 turning off is if anything I go 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.130
 to press to turn on the smartphone e 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.690
 the slot for the micro sd 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.930
 on the other side we find the barbell 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.239
 of the volume and the two slots for the sims 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.280
 laterally the 3.5 mm jack for the 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.810
 earphones at the top of the receivers 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.030
 infrared for the use of the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 device as a micro slot remote control 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.160
 usb of microphone main speaker of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.190
 system in the back we find 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.790
 instead the 16 megapixel camera with 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.610
 sensor sony mx 214 one of the specifications 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.580
 very interesting of the kubot x11 is a 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.750
 Dual LED flash even dual ton 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.010
 therefore from this point of view the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.310
 photographic sector and very much 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.810
 edited on the cube on this kubot 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.610
 let's go see the unlock the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.459
 device we are going to increase a little 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.660
 the brightness otherwise you don't see 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.760
 just nothing 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.170
 here it is now much better in the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.390
 front part at the top we find 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.489
 obviously the 8 megapixel camera 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.350
 casting capsules and sensors of 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.450
 brightness and proximity at the bottom does not 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.340
 the soft keys are present on the body 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.530
 touch because as you see the same are 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.959
 directly to the display a display that is 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.940
 5.5 inch drive with resolution 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.739
 hd 1080 x 720 pixels realized by jd e 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.660
 especially made with technology 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.480
 internal or the technology that there 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100
 allows to greatly reduce the thickness 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.680
 of the panels and therefore accordingly 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.080
 also that of the devices and in this 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.920
 case he did it because we find a 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.099
 device alone 6 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.750
 mm so really very very thin 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.900
 from the hardware point of view like 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.590
 anticipated the qubit x11 not yes 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.270
 features for a lot of hardware 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.980
 modern and a little outdated in that 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.340
 mounts the old trotta core chipset 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.079
 average generation that admits the 65 92 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.090
 which on this smartphone is in the 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.230
 version a or the version with coconut 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.050
 maximum 1.4 gigahertz side by side 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.150
 this processor 2GB of RAM and 16 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.750
 gigabyte of internal memory we see 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.340
 only partitions you all into one 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.960
 partition of about 13 gigabytes 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.970
 obviously available in this too 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.850
 In this case it will be possible to insert a micro 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.650
 sd and use it as a primary disk of 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.560
 so no problem writing from 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.210
 point of view of internal storage sd 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.220
 up to 32 gigabytes 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.880
 from the point of view of design as already 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.830
 quickly anticipated the kubot x11 is 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.410
 certainly a little square a little 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.130
 tile is not very modern remembers a 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.820
 po the yosh han x8 is definitely not 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.979
 very original from this point of view 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.210
 obviously all these aspects will have to 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.710
 be thorough about the review 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.840
 complete including those concerning 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.580
 the solidity we say from the structure that 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.800
 but all in all it seems to be 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.080
 pretty good though I don't want to 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.630
 express myself further for maybe not 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.539
 say wrong things but also the 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.660
 maximum support 4g connectivity 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.090
 in fact all'acca spa plus wifi bgn 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.669
 bluetooth in version 4.0 and is present 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.770
 I also show you the fm radio 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.240
 for this unboxing they gave everything to me 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.640
 remember you can take advantage of it as 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.550
 always in the comment box for all 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.110
 questions about this kubot x11 of course 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.060
 we will be delighted to respond to 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.810
 themselves in the context of the review 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.350
 full 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.350
 thank you
