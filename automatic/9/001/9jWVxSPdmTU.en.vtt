what's up hu and this is going to be a
very<00:00:03.899> basic<00:00:04.200> tutorial<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.069> getting<00:00:05.460> started

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
very basic tutorial on getting started

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.140 
very basic tutorial on getting started
with<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.359> inheritance<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.230> vector<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.970> I'm

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
with the inheritance of vector so I'm

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.370 
with the inheritance of vector so I'm
just<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> create<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.840> simple<00:00:10.110> animation

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
just going to create a simple animation

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.299 
just going to create a simple animation
where<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:12.120> cloner<00:00:12.420> objects<00:00:13.200> move<00:00:13.500> from<00:00:13.769> an<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
where the cloner objects move from an a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.700 
where the cloner objects move from an a
pattern<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> V<00:00:15.870> pattern<00:00:15.900> they're<00:00:16.560> going

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
pattern into a V pattern they're going

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.000 
pattern into a V pattern they're going
to<00:00:16.800> morph<00:00:17.070> between<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.699> shapes<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:19.010> pretty

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to morph between the two shapes a pretty

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.679 
to morph between the two shapes a pretty
simple<00:00:20.340> effect<00:00:20.670> we're<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> create<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
simple effect we're going to create this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.070 
simple effect we're going to create this
from<00:00:21.869> scratch<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> start

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
from scratch so I'm just going to start

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.259 
from scratch so I'm just going to start
from<00:00:25.230> scratch<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> create<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.519> mold

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
from scratch I'm going to create a mold

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.450 
from scratch I'm going to create a mold
text<00:00:27.599> object<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> label<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
text object just going to label it a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
text object just going to label it a
then<00:00:30.090> go<00:00:30.210> into<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> settings<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.380> text

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
then go into the settings here for text

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.590 
then go into the settings here for text
I'm<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> put<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:35.239> I'm<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> have

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I'm going to put a and I'm going to have

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479 
I'm going to put a and I'm going to have
to<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.870> editable<00:00:37.440> which<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> Velva

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
to make this editable which is a Velva

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
to make this editable which is a Velva
pain<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.420> highlight<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
pain but if you just highlight it and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.819 
pain but if you just highlight it and
then<00:00:40.440> hit<00:00:40.649> C<00:00:41.989> then<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.469> through<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
then hit C then go down through this

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.369 
then hit C then go down through this
stack<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> you'll<00:00:44.579> find<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.239> spline<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
stack and you'll find a spline and a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.520 
stack and you'll find a spline and a
sort<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> NURBS<00:00:47.100> object<00:00:47.989> extrude<00:00:48.989> object<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
sort of NURBS object extrude object and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
sort of NURBS object extrude object and
hit<00:00:49.649> C<00:00:49.920> again<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.180> you'll<00:00:51.300> end<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.660> like

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
hit C again and you'll end up with like

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
hit C again and you'll end up with like
the<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:52.890> caps<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> front<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the a and the two caps for the front and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.139 
the a and the two caps for the front and
back<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.570> select<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
back so just select them all and go to

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
back so just select them all and go to
objects<00:00:57.149> connect<00:00:57.570> objects<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.140> delete<00:00:58.379> now

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
objects connect objects and delete now

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.100 
objects connect objects and delete now
we<00:00:58.859> finally<00:00:59.370> got<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> polygon<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:02.899> if<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.989> go

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we finally got a polygon a and if I go

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.350 
we finally got a polygon a and if I go
to<00:01:04.140> point<00:01:04.500> mode<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.369> click<00:01:06.740> and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
to point mode and then I right click and

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.929 
to point mode and then I right click and
hit<00:01:09.710> space<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> select<00:01:11.670> mode

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
hit space it's going to select mode

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.570 
hit space it's going to select mode
right<00:01:12.210> click<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.010> rip<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.130> optimize

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
right click and then rip on optimize

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
right click and then rip on optimize
option<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> make<00:01:15.810> sure<00:01:15.840> all

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
option which is going to make sure all

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
option which is going to make sure all
the<00:01:16.710> vertexes<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.400> welded<00:01:17.759> together<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the vertexes are welded together the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
the vertexes are welded together the
mesh<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.439> nice<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.770> clean<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> optimized<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
mesh is nice and clean and optimized so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
mesh is nice and clean and optimized so
that's<00:01:21.600> our<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> piece<00:01:22.820> I'm<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> create

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that's our a piece I'm going to create

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.210 
that's our a piece I'm going to create
an<00:01:24.360> over<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> mo<00:01:25.020> text<00:01:25.380> object<00:01:26.330> call<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.479> B<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
an over a mo text object call this B and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
an over a mo text object call this B and
then<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> text<00:01:29.670> option<00:01:30.380> make<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> B<00:01:32.990> just

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
then in the text option make a B just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
then in the text option make a B just
move<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.950> hit<00:01:35.490> C<00:01:37.490> find<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> two

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
move that out then hit C find the two

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
move that out then hit C find the two
pieces<00:01:39.090> let's<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.049> again<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.790> three

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
pieces let's see again I like all three

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
pieces let's see again I like all three
pieces<00:01:42.390> object<00:01:43.310> connect<00:01:44.310> objects<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.850> delete

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
pieces object connect objects and delete

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.210 
pieces object connect objects and delete
and<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.600> gives<00:01:45.899> us<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.520> polygon<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> BES

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
and that gives us the polygon the BES

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.469 
and that gives us the polygon the BES
I'm<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.729> click<00:01:50.759> again<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I'm just going to right click again and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.399 
I'm just going to right click again and
I'm<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> optimize<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.649> mesh<00:01:54.409> okay

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I'm just going to optimize the mesh okay

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.350 
I'm just going to optimize the mesh okay
so<00:01:55.470> we've<00:01:55.740> got<00:01:55.770> our<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.610> our<00:01:56.700> B<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.180> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so we've got our a and our B I'm just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
so we've got our a and our B I'm just
going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.630> rid<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> rid<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> set<00:01:58.680> point

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
going to get rid of rid of the set point

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.980 
going to get rid of rid of the set point
one

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.830 

so<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.040> I'm<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.310> create<00:02:03.729> whoops<00:02:04.510> a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
so now I'm going to create whoops a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.680 
so now I'm going to create whoops a
little<00:02:05.350> glitch<00:02:05.560> here<00:02:08.850> three<00:02:09.850> now<00:02:10.030> here<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.390> go

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
little glitch here three now here we go

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.910 
little glitch here three now here we go
I'm<00:02:11.440> going<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.680> create<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.950> cloner<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:13.920> I'm

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I'm going to create a cloner and I'm

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.449 
I'm going to create a cloner and I'm
just<00:02:15.069> going<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.280> use<00:02:15.400> fears<00:02:15.790> for<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:16.120> so

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
just going to use fears for now so

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.970 
just going to use fears for now so
creates<00:02:18.459> fear<00:02:18.819> put<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.270> under<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> corner<00:02:19.980> I'm

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
creates fear put it under the corner I'm

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.449 
creates fear put it under the corner I'm
going<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.220> make<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> sphere<00:02:21.760> pretty<00:02:22.450> small

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
going to make the sphere pretty small

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.949 
going to make the sphere pretty small
now<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.640> cloner<00:02:24.940> I'm<00:02:25.239> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> go<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.630> an

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
now on cloner I'm going to go to an

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.979 
now on cloner I'm going to go to an
object<00:02:26.500> mode<00:02:27.209> I'm<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.569> drag<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
object mode I'm just going to drag and

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.199 
object mode I'm just going to drag and
drop<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.860> as<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.910> see<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
drop the a and as you can see the

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.040 
drop the a and as you can see the
spheres<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:31.959> cloning<00:02:32.410> onto<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:34.050> but

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
spheres are now cloning onto the a but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.080 
spheres are now cloning onto the a but
instead<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> vertex<00:02:36.010> distribution<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.850> want<00:02:37.030> to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
instead of vertex distribution I want to

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.090 
instead of vertex distribution I want to
kind<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.450> more<00:02:37.600> random<00:02:38.500> natural<00:02:38.950> air

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
kind of more random natural air

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.440 
kind of more random natural air
distribution<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:39.880> I'm<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.360> go

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
distribution so I'm actually going to go

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.870 
distribution so I'm actually going to go
to<00:02:40.480> volume<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:42.250> way<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.670> going<00:02:42.790> to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
to volume that way it's just going to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.960 
to volume that way it's just going to
try<00:02:43.209> put<00:02:44.110> some<00:02:44.290> kind<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.500> randomly<00:02:45.459> over<00:02:45.850> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
try put some kind of randomly over the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.250 
try put some kind of randomly over the
volume<00:02:46.330> which<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.630> pretty<00:02:46.900> cool

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
volume which is pretty cool

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.960 
volume which is pretty cool
then<00:02:47.440> I'm<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.120> me<00:02:50.489> create<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.880> T

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
then I'm just going to me create a T

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.840 
then I'm just going to me create a T
clones<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.110> increase<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.530> count<00:02:53.850> and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
clones so just increase the count and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.880 
clones so just increase the count and
I'm<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:55.060> going<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.239> make<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.800> invisible<00:02:56.800> in

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
I'm just going to make a invisible in

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.059 
I'm just going to make a invisible in
the<00:02:56.980> viewport<00:02:57.489> actual<00:02:57.970> polygon<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.860> as<00:02:59.950> you

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
the viewport actual polygon and as you

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.050 
the viewport actual polygon and as you
can<00:03:00.160> see<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.580> kind<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.819> scattering<00:03:01.660> off<00:03:03.060> sort

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
can see it's kind of scattering off sort

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.420 
can see it's kind of scattering off sort
of<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.780> shaped<00:03:05.319> scattering<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.040> spheres

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
of a a a shaped scattering of spheres

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.539 
of a a a shaped scattering of spheres
which<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> good<00:03:07.269> start<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:08.130> now<00:03:09.130> we<00:03:09.280> want

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
which is a good start so now we want

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.180 
which is a good start so now we want
these<00:03:09.730> spheres<00:03:10.360> going<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.720> move<00:03:10.959> from<00:03:11.829> over

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
these spheres going to move from over

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.620 
these spheres going to move from over
here<00:03:12.459> over<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.600> B<00:03:14.070> now<00:03:15.070> if<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.150> are<00:03:16.299> had<00:03:16.600> a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
here over to the B now if you are had a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.680 
here over to the B now if you are had a
look<00:03:16.780> at<00:03:16.900> my<00:03:17.019> matrix<00:03:17.820> tutorial<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.540> should

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
look at my matrix tutorial you should

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.120 
look at my matrix tutorial you should
really<00:03:19.870> check<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.170> out<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:20.680> basically<00:03:20.920> we're

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
really check it out but basically we're

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.340 
really check it out but basically we're
just<00:03:21.160> going<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.489> create<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.820> matrix<00:03:22.660> cloner

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
just going to create a matrix cloner

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.890 
just going to create a matrix cloner
which<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.650> basically<00:03:23.950> just<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.459> cloner<00:03:24.900> except

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
which is basically just a cloner except

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.110 
which is basically just a cloner except
it<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.140> stores<00:03:26.560> position<00:03:27.130> data<00:03:27.310> that's<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
it just stores position data that's it

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.030 
it just stores position data that's it
there's<00:03:28.360> no<00:03:28.390> these<00:03:28.840> squares<00:03:29.230> on<00:03:29.500> actual

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
there's no these squares on actual

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.690 
there's no these squares on actual
objects<00:03:30.700> they're<00:03:30.850> just<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.410> positions<00:03:32.700> just

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
objects they're just like positions just

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.610 
objects they're just like positions just
kind<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.540> virtual<00:03:35.049> positions<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> I'm<00:03:38.440> going

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
kind of virtual positions so I'm going

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.699 
kind of virtual positions so I'm going
to<00:03:39.150> set<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.269> matrix<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.870> object<00:03:41.290> mode<00:03:41.470> and

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
to set this matrix to object mode and

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.030 
to set this matrix to object mode and
the<00:03:42.700> object<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.540> be<00:03:43.660> B<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.290> we<00:03:45.010> can

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
the object is going to be B and we can

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.259 
the object is going to be B and we can
see<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.459> matrix<00:03:46.440> positions<00:03:47.440> kind<00:03:48.160> of

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
see the matrix positions kind of

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.170 
see the matrix positions kind of
scattered<00:03:49.269> over<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.630> B<00:03:49.780> which<00:03:50.079> is<00:03:50.200> good<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
scattered over the B which is good and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.490 
scattered over the B which is good and
distribution<00:03:52.180> I'm<00:03:52.630> going<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.870> set<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.109> again

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
distribution I'm going to set this again

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.340 
distribution I'm going to set this again
to<00:03:53.739> volume<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.690> I'm<00:03:55.690> going<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.840> match<00:03:56.079> the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
to volume and I'm going to match the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
to volume and I'm going to match the
number<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.280> clones<00:03:57.910> we<00:03:58.180> created<00:03:58.690> for<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.079> so

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
number of clones we created for the a so

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.860 
number of clones we created for the a so
created<00:04:00.370> 80<00:04:00.579> clones<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.329> I'm<00:04:01.450> going<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.690> do<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
created 80 clones so I'm going to do the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.860 
created 80 clones so I'm going to do the
exact<00:04:02.230> same<00:04:02.440> for<00:04:02.739> our<00:04:02.859> matrix<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.660> we've<00:04:04.750> got

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
exact same for our matrix and we've got

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.680 
exact same for our matrix and we've got
80<00:04:05.109> kind<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.560> positions<00:04:06.160> on<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.970> B<00:04:07.150> I'm<00:04:07.420> just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
80 kind of positions on the B I'm just

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.650 
80 kind of positions on the B I'm just
going<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.900> make<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.079> D<00:04:08.260> kind<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.590> invisible

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.570 

so<00:04:13.660> if<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.380> just<00:04:14.530> go<00:04:14.650> back<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.980> cloner<00:04:15.250> now

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
so if I just go back to the cloner now

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.599 
so if I just go back to the cloner now
we're<00:04:16.359> ready<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.660> add<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.019> factor<00:04:17.829> mograph

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
we're ready to add the factor mograph

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.659 
we're ready to add the factor mograph
effector<00:04:19.680> inheritance<00:04:20.680> effector<00:04:21.130> I'm<00:04:21.430> just

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
effector inheritance effector I'm just

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.110 
effector inheritance effector I'm just
going<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:21.880> move<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.120> down<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.660> stack<00:04:22.900> and

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
going to move that down the stack and

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.320 
going to move that down the stack and
the<00:04:26.100> object<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.250> looking<00:04:27.550> for<00:04:27.730> an<00:04:27.820> object<00:04:27.940> here

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
the object is looking for an object here

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.730 
the object is looking for an object here
under<00:04:29.139> a<00:04:29.490> factor<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.110> yeah<00:04:32.110> that's<00:04:32.530> going<00:04:32.680> to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
under a factor and yeah that's going to

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.360 
under a factor and yeah that's going to
be<00:04:32.830> our<00:04:32.980> matrix<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.650> just<00:04:35.800> drag<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.130> drop<00:04:36.160> that

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
be our matrix so just drag and drop that

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.490 
be our matrix so just drag and drop that
because<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.700> matrix<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.240> basically<00:04:37.320> got<00:04:38.320> hold

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
because the matrix is basically got hold

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.590 
because the matrix is basically got hold
of<00:04:38.620> B<00:04:38.800> positions<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:39.669> we<00:04:39.790> want<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.060> want<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:40.510> to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
of B positions so we want to want it to

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.280 
of B positions so we want to want it to
go<00:04:40.690> directly<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.590> matrix<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.510> then<00:04:43.510> if<00:04:44.200> I

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
go directly to the matrix and then if I

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.070 
go directly to the matrix and then if I
play<00:04:44.530> with<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.710> strength<00:04:45.040> nothing<00:04:45.460> happens

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
play with a strength nothing happens

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.570 
play with a strength nothing happens
final<00:04:47.080> step<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.470> we<00:04:47.680> need<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.919> take<00:04:48.100> this<00:04:48.310> here

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
final step is we need to take this here

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.330 
final step is we need to take this here
morph<00:04:48.880> motion<00:04:49.330> object<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.470> now<00:04:50.710> when<00:04:51.250> you

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
morph motion object and now when you

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.580 
morph motion object and now when you
play<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:51.820> slider<00:04:53.730> its<00:04:54.730> cloning<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:56.500> I'm

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
play with this slider its cloning so I'm

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.080 
play with this slider its cloning so I'm
just<00:04:56.710> going<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.919> hide<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.370> matrix<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:58.000> the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
just going to hide the matrix in the

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.960 
just going to hide the matrix in the
viewport<00:04:59.190> and<00:05:00.190> we've<00:05:00.340> got<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:00.580> cloning<00:05:04.650> so

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
viewport and we've got this cloning so

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.030 
viewport and we've got this cloning so
what<00:05:06.970> we<00:05:07.090> what<00:05:07.990> we<00:05:08.020> can<00:05:08.229> do<00:05:08.350> then<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.590> we<00:05:08.919> can

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
what we what we can do then is we can

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.719 
what we what we can do then is we can
create<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.370> fall-off<00:05:09.900> just<00:05:10.900> linear<00:05:11.290> fall-off

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
create a fall-off just linear fall-off

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.460 
create a fall-off just linear fall-off
I'm<00:05:12.729> just<00:05:12.940> going<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.120> rotate<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:14.760> 90<00:05:15.760> degrees

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
I'm just going to rotate that 90 degrees

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.200 
I'm just going to rotate that 90 degrees
whoops

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:31.490 

should<00:05:24.210> work<00:05:24.480> so<00:05:28.760> yep<00:05:29.840> inheritance<00:05:30.840> factor<00:05:31.320> I

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
should work so yep inheritance factor I

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.670 
should work so yep inheritance factor I
just<00:05:31.800> set<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.040> strength<00:05:32.430> 100<00:05:36.140> as<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:37.350> can<00:05:37.500> see

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
just set the strength 100 as you can see

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.290 
just set the strength 100 as you can see
now<00:05:37.980> we<00:05:38.550> have<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.730> much<00:05:38.970> more<00:05:39.180> natural

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
now we have a much more natural

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.930 
now we have a much more natural
spillover<00:05:45.560> it's<00:05:46.560> basically<00:05:46.860> one<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.190> factor

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
spillover it's basically one the factor

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.710 
spillover it's basically one the factor
touches<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.910> cloner<00:05:50.910> that's<00:05:51.450> when<00:05:51.600> they

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
touches the a cloner that's when they

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.540 
touches the a cloner that's when they
start<00:05:51.960> going<00:05:52.200> because<00:05:52.980> this<00:05:53.160> is<00:05:53.280> a<00:05:53.310> linear

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
start going because this is a linear

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.810 
start going because this is a linear
cloner<00:05:54.090> just<00:05:54.270> imagine<00:05:54.810> this<00:05:54.960> like<00:05:55.140> as<00:05:55.320> a<00:05:55.820> flat

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
cloner just imagine this like as a flat

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.020 
cloner just imagine this like as a flat
infinite<00:05:57.480> plane<00:05:58.040> that<00:05:59.040> just<00:05:59.250> slices<00:05:59.670> for<00:05:59.910> it

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
infinite plane that just slices for it

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.750 
infinite plane that just slices for it
and<00:06:00.270> then<00:06:00.480> we<00:06:01.380> can<00:06:01.860> adjust<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.340> fall<00:06:02.580> off

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
and then we can adjust the fall off

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.150 
and then we can adjust the fall off
slightly<00:06:03.620> seems<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.710> be<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.830> bit<00:06:05.060> strong<00:06:07.160> that

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
slightly seems to be a bit strong that

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.390 
slightly seems to be a bit strong that
would<00:06:08.310> be<00:06:08.400> here<00:06:12.650> actually<00:06:13.650> maybe<00:06:13.800> it's<00:06:13.980> better

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
would be here actually maybe it's better

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.160 
would be here actually maybe it's better
before<00:06:14.640> more<00:06:15.510> gradual<00:06:17.600> so<00:06:18.600> yeah<00:06:18.750> those<00:06:18.990> are

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
before more gradual so yeah those are

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.630 
before more gradual so yeah those are
the<00:06:19.230> basics<00:06:19.710> of<00:06:19.920> the<00:06:20.220> inheritance<00:06:21.180> corner
