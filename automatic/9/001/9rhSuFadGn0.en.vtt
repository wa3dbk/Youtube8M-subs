for<00:05:06.220> my<00:05:06.310> layout<00:05:06.700> video<00:05:07.260> I've<00:05:08.260> been<00:05:08.560> searching

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
for my layout video I've been searching

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.490 
for my layout video I've been searching
around<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.640> you<00:05:10.480> know<00:05:10.600> like<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.110> try<00:05:11.170> and<00:05:11.380> get

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
around and you know like I try and get

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.580 
around and you know like I try and get
stuff<00:05:11.740> for<00:05:11.890> free<00:05:12.750> but<00:05:13.750> it's<00:05:13.900> not<00:05:14.050> working<00:05:14.230> so

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
stuff for free but it's not working so

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.040 
stuff for free but it's not working so
far<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.160> moment<00:05:16.090> I'm<00:05:16.150> just<00:05:16.180> practicing<00:05:16.930> in

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
far so moment I'm just practicing in

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.340 
far so moment I'm just practicing in
this<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.610> Monte<00:05:19.510> where<00:05:19.630> does<00:05:19.780> I<00:05:19.810> say<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.080> can

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
this and Monte where does I say you can

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.390 
this and Monte where does I say you can
use<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.740> tie<00:05:21.270> you<00:05:22.270> can<00:05:22.390> tie<00:05:22.540> pieces<00:05:22.990> together

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
use the tie you can tie pieces together

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.690 
use the tie you can tie pieces together
with<00:05:24.400> bonsai<00:05:25.120> wire<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:27.040> can<00:05:27.220> do<00:05:27.370> things

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
with bonsai wire you can do things

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.910 
with bonsai wire you can do things
sometimes

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
sometimes

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:41.650 
sometimes
I<00:05:28.980> said<00:05:29.700> logo<00:05:30.770> let's<00:05:31.770> see<00:05:31.920> what<00:05:32.100> we<00:05:32.190> can<00:05:32.220> get

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.300 

remember<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:42.750> don't<00:05:42.900> have<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.200> stay<00:05:43.560> within

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
remember you don't have to stay within

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.450 
remember you don't have to stay within
the<00:05:44.520> constraints<00:05:44.910> of<00:05:45.120> your<00:05:45.900> technical<00:05:46.890> aspect

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
the constraints of your technical aspect

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.910 
the constraints of your technical aspect
of<00:05:47.520> it<00:05:50.540> you<00:05:51.540> can<00:05:51.960> have<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.200> wood<00:05:52.440> coming<00:05:52.710> out

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
of it you can have the wood coming out

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.060 
of it you can have the wood coming out
the<00:05:53.070> top<00:05:53.280> just<00:05:54.210> give<00:05:54.390> it<00:05:54.540> a<00:05:54.630> bit<00:05:54.780> more<00:05:54.810> height

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
the top just give it a bit more height

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.450 
the top just give it a bit more height
I<00:05:57.140> say<00:05:58.140> I'm<00:05:58.230> only<00:05:58.380> doing<00:05:58.650> this<00:05:58.740> quickly<00:05:59.040> so

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
I say I'm only doing this quickly so

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:08.690 
I say I'm only doing this quickly so
don't<00:06:00.380> expect<00:06:01.380> too<00:06:01.830> much<00:06:07.370> it's<00:06:08.370> all<00:06:08.460> about

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
don't expect too much it's all about

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.650 
don't expect too much it's all about
creating<00:06:12.170> creating<00:06:13.170> different<00:06:13.560> levels

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
creating creating different levels

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.550 
creating creating different levels
because<00:06:15.660> you<00:06:15.750> don't<00:06:15.930> want<00:06:16.080> everything<00:06:16.290> up

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
because you don't want everything up

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.420 
because you don't want everything up
high<00:06:16.740> you<00:06:16.800> want<00:06:18.260> your<00:06:19.260> bits<00:06:19.620> and<00:06:19.800> pieces<00:06:19.980> down

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
high you want your bits and pieces down

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.250 
high you want your bits and pieces down
low<00:06:20.970> as<00:06:21.150> well<00:06:23.510> don't<00:06:24.510> just<00:06:24.720> have<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.990> use<00:06:25.110> them

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
low as well don't just have to use them

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:32.080 
low as well don't just have to use them
and<00:06:25.380> do<00:06:25.530> it

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:45.300 

you<00:06:33.090> can<00:06:33.240> add<00:06:33.360> in<00:06:33.710> some<00:06:34.710> dragon<00:06:35.040> rock

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.100 

I'm<00:06:45.850> sorry<00:06:46.090> I'm<00:06:46.240> only<00:06:46.420> doing<00:06:46.690> this<00:06:46.780> roughly

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
I'm sorry I'm only doing this roughly

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.430 
I'm sorry I'm only doing this roughly
sir<00:06:47.470> I<00:06:50.310> put<00:06:51.310> a<00:06:51.730> bit<00:06:52.389> more<00:06:52.570> planning<00:06:52.780> and<00:06:53.139> if<00:06:53.260> I

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
sir I put a bit more planning and if I

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.150 
sir I put a bit more planning and if I
wasn't<00:06:56.070> going<00:06:57.070> to<00:06:57.160> do<00:06:57.310> it<00:06:58.770> properly<00:06:59.770> and

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
wasn't going to do it properly and

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.710 
wasn't going to do it properly and
obviously<00:07:00.460> the<00:07:00.669> substrate<00:07:01.090> level<00:07:01.240> isn't<00:07:01.630> how

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
obviously the substrate level isn't how

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.960 
obviously the substrate level isn't how
I<00:07:01.750> wanted<00:07:04.590> I'll<00:07:05.590> be<00:07:05.830> added<00:07:06.100> substrate<00:07:06.580> after

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
I wanted I'll be added substrate after

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.420 
I wanted I'll be added substrate after
I've<00:07:07.060> messed<00:07:07.300> around<00:07:07.480> with<00:07:07.690> wood<00:07:07.960> all<00:07:08.169> right

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
I've messed around with wood all right

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.930 
I've messed around with wood all right
bangle<00:07:09.430> the<00:07:09.639> the<00:07:10.630> substrate<00:07:11.460> how<00:07:12.460> I<00:07:12.490> want<00:07:12.820> it

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
bangle the the substrate how I want it

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.600 
bangle the the substrate how I want it
then<00:07:13.210> I<00:07:13.330> can<00:07:13.570> push<00:07:13.780> bits<00:07:14.020> of<00:07:14.169> wood<00:07:14.320> in<00:07:14.500> to<00:07:14.740> get<00:07:15.580> a

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
then I can push bits of wood in to get a

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.500 
then I can push bits of wood in to get a
stay<00:07:16.150> in<00:07:16.210> place<00:07:16.560> I'm<00:07:17.560> just<00:07:18.330> trying<00:07:19.330> to<00:07:19.360> give

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
stay in place I'm just trying to give

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.700 
stay in place I'm just trying to give
you<00:07:19.630> guys<00:07:19.810> an<00:07:19.990> idea<00:07:20.050> of<00:07:20.790> what<00:07:21.790> you<00:07:21.880> can<00:07:22.030> do

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
you guys an idea of what you can do

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.500 
you guys an idea of what you can do
we'll<00:07:23.710> just<00:07:23.890> leave<00:07:23.980> it<00:07:24.040> at<00:07:24.190> that<00:07:24.340> I'll<00:07:25.180> make

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
we'll just leave it at that I'll make

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.060 
we'll just leave it at that I'll make
this<00:07:25.630> camera<00:07:25.900> again<00:07:26.230> so<00:07:26.380> you<00:07:26.530> can<00:07:26.620> see<00:07:26.680> a<00:07:26.830> bit

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
this camera again so you can see a bit

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:34.920 
this camera again so you can see a bit
closer<00:07:27.280> up<00:07:33.090> so<00:07:34.090> just<00:07:34.300> after<00:07:34.419> a<00:07:34.600> couple<00:07:34.660> of

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
closer up so just after a couple of

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.370 
closer up so just after a couple of
minutes<00:07:35.140> got<00:07:35.320> this<00:07:36.540> the<00:07:37.540> Manzi<00:07:37.870> wood<00:07:38.020> and<00:07:38.229> the

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380 
minutes got this the Manzi wood and the

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.860 
minutes got this the Manzi wood and the
dragon<00:07:38.680> stone
