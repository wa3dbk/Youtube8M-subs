job against the Ravens offense

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
job against the Ravens offense
specifically<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> run<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.530> did<00:02:07.710> in

the colts would win

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.590 
the colts would win
