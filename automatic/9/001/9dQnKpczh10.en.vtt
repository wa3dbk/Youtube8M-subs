00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.850
 Hello, good morning, I'm Fermin, the cook 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.440
 wooden 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:13.150
 let's present this is a good skewer 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.849
 simple and quite with squid to the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.849
 iron with a dressing that later 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 we have to take that first plate 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.820
 we 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.010
 at the same time of cooking you need the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.870
 chips where the iron is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.050
 approximately 45 minutes is that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.000
 it does not interest much 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.000
 the best of sneezing and all of 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.479
 all right 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:33.900
 It is also interesting that you read 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:33.900
 let's use what we do 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.789
 we have put the leave 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.770
 and a short time that is not burned either 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.150
 just catch the juices of iu 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.460
 here at first you throw nothing 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.780
 of salt 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.180
 when I turn it around so it does not 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.400
 so it's not clear that I'm not 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.250
 two points 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.280
 it is very important to pour the salty 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.200
 turn it around insisted 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.200
 is I do not know that in bread simply 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.000
 It is also very important 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.000
 how to treat it 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:30.010
 there are many I caught less than what they do 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.170
 is seriously crush gift 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.360
 dry site 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.700
 it has to be juicy juicy fiery 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.940
 where is the Chinese inside us 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.830
 we clean them thoroughly 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 I'm just going to tell you that we get some 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.870
 40-50 kilos per week 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:58.330
 of the 40 50 kilos that we have taken 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.330
 given tests and tests and that's how more 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.200
 the simple big one because this one you leave it like this 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.820
 do not fill it with winners we do not do 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.170
 another variety of squid that are 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.140
 sides of the year 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.120
 and it's the same 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.860
 but we fight with onion or teaspoon 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.909
 and sometimes we have done the most 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.980
 those more laborious is more laborious 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.200
 fill them clear that we do the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.840
 chipirÃ³n of risks in its ink but 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.610
 as as our specialty are the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.400
 squid and let's say so many 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.530
 chipirones songs we have gone to the most 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.720
 easy that is grilled and baby squid 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.890
 always fresh and see in entity between 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.510
 always always always very 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.010
 important it shows a lot of the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.490
 difference of a frozen lion chip a 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.910
 fresh cyclone 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.360
 well then 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.360
 Y 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.630
 once we have the baby squid 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.810
 we throw a dressing 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.720
 it is an abyss hills the famous abyss 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.680
 giles de 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 stirred with onion parsley and some 7 of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.610
 all ways of screaming since always 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:41.659
 has a secret to an element 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.659
 peculiar that not only in this also 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.020
 let's do a little bit 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.839
 It is not interesting to wet it too much 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.339
 so much that it gets soaked because 

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.440
 if not in the end what you eat your 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:03.660
 mobile 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.070
 and then we'll take a little 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.070
 the candy with modern 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.479
 and there we have the pinchito 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.639
 of cuttlefish 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:23.529
 is I think our star skewer the 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.900
 bar along with hunting because blind 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:29.300
 we also sell we sell quite the 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.310
 deer when it's season 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.700
 and then we have a lot of variety of sayings 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.410
 but 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.790
 but this is the king but there is always 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.680
 some that come out more than others and do not 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.690
 knows 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.110
 thank you very much for having us 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.680
 presented this exquisite skewer of 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.680
 pick up lines
