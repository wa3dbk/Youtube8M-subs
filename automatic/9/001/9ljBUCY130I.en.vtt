00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.000
 Everyone has a competition in his mind 

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.800
 About good ideas and bad ideas 

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.900
 Hoping to win good ideas 

00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:08.000
 For me I always have two 

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.100
 I have this thing that I believe in .. the good thing 

00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:11.400
 This is what I believe in 

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.400
 There is this thing! 

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:17.200
 I do not believe in it ... but it exists 

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.500
 It is always that thing .. and then this thing 

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.950
 It became like classification in my mind 

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.500
 Which he called: Of course 

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:30.999
 But maybe 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I will give you an example 

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:41.600
 Like: Of course children who are allergic to nuts 

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.000
 They must protect ... of course 

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.500
 We must separate their food from walnuts 

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.000
 And to have their medicines all the time 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.000
 And anyone who makes or offers food 

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:58.000
 He must be aware of the deadly sensitivity of the nut, of course 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.000
 But maybe .. 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:07.000
 Maybe if you touch the nut you will have to die 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.800
 of course not 

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.000
 Jesus Christ 

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.000
 I have a nephew who has the same sensitivity 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.650
 I would be disappointed if something happened to him 

00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:25.000
 But maybe .. 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.000
 Maybe if we did that for a year 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:36.000
 We will eliminate allergy from walnuts forever 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.500
 No, of course not 

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.000
 Of course if you were fighting for your homeland 

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.750
 Being shot or hurt will be a terrible tragedy 

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:53.600
 Of course, of course 

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:56.000
 But maybe .. 

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.000
 Maybe if you took your weapon and went to another country 

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.700
 I was shot, it would not be strange 

00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:07.500
 Maybe if you hit a shot from the person you were looking at you 

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's a little wrong 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.200
 Of course, of course 

00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:32.000
 Slavery is the worst thing that has ever happened 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.000
 Hear, hear 

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.000
 All of you have applauded the dead children of the walnut 

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:41.000
 For the children who died because of the nuts you applauded 

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.500
 So you are with me in this now 

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:45.000
 Do you understand? 

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.500
 You are not entitled to choose 

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:51.500
 These children did nothing to you 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.000
 Of course, of course 

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.000
 Slavery is the worst thing that has ever happened 

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.500
 Of course every time he talked 

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:03.500
 Blacks in American Jews in Egypt 

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:06.000
 Every time a smooth man is enslaved 

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.900
 It's horrible, of course 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
 But maybe .. 

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.000
 Perhaps every monumental achievement of man in history 

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:19.000
 It was because of slavery 

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.000
 In everything wherever you go 

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.000
 How did they build these pyramids? 

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:28.000
 They just threw people away and tortured them until they finished them 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 How can we travel across the country by train so fast? 

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.500
 We just threw some Chinese into the caves and blew them up 

00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:36.500
 We did not care about what happened to them 

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:41.000
 There is no limit to what you can do when you do not care for certain people 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.000
 You can do anything 

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:47.000
 Hence the greatness of man 

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:51.000
 We are bad people who do not care about others 

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.500
 Even today, how do we own this technology? 

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.000
 Because in the factory that produces these they jumped out of the roof .. because it's a nightmare there 

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.000
 You really have a choice 

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.000
 You can get candles and horses 

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.400
 And be nice to others 

00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:09.000
 Or let someone suffer for a while 

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.600
 Just to write a comment on YouTube 

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.000
 While you are defecating
