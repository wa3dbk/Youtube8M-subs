goodra<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.330> I'm<00:01:05.259> thinking<00:01:05.890> I<00:01:06.009> can<00:01:06.190> probably

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
goodra and I'm thinking I can probably

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.210 
goodra and I'm thinking I can probably
live<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.299> dragon<00:01:07.810> pulse<00:01:07.990> if<00:01:08.619> he<00:01:08.890> went<00:01:09.040> for<00:01:09.190> the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
live a dragon pulse if he went for the

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.340 
live a dragon pulse if he went for the
Draco<00:01:09.610> there's<00:01:10.270> no<00:01:10.540> hope<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:11.020> would<00:01:11.229> have

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
Draco there's no hope I would have

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.109 
Draco there's no hope I would have
definitely<00:01:11.710> died<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.549> was<00:01:12.729> thinking<00:01:12.880> this

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
definitely died but I was thinking this

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.899 
definitely died but I was thinking this
would<00:01:13.270> be<00:01:13.299> like<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.570> really<00:01:14.070> bulky<00:01:15.070> goodra<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:15.880> I

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
would be like a really bulky goodra so I

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.039 
would be like a really bulky goodra so I
thought<00:01:16.149> I'd<00:01:16.299> be<00:01:16.420> able<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.630> but<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:16.930> was

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
thought I'd be able to but that was

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.289 
thought I'd be able to but that was
really<00:01:17.380> close<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:18.009> came<00:01:18.130> close<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.940> just

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
really close I came close to just

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.600

getting<00:01:19.570> destroyed<00:01:20.049> there<00:01:20.320> I'm<00:01:20.979> very<00:01:21.399> lucky

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.650 
heliolisk I predicting the switch into
something<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:13.239> for<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.480> side

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
something and I just go for the side

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.870 
something and I just go for the side
shot<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.859> case<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.160> wanted<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> stay<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.820> I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
shot in case you wanted to stay and I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.430 
shot in case you wanted to stay and I
would<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.120> destroyed<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.690> goodra<00:02:17.079> well

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
would have destroyed the goodra well

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.920 
would have destroyed the goodra well
most<00:02:18.280> likely<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.670> would<00:02:19.329> have<00:02:19.450> destroyed<00:02:19.750> him

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
most likely I would have destroyed him

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.990 
most likely I would have destroyed him
and<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.980> would<00:02:21.100> hit<00:02:21.280> anything<00:02:21.519> else<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:21.910> his

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and it would hit anything else on his

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.390 
and it would hit anything else on his
team<00:02:22.180> hard<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.750> he<00:02:23.470> gets<00:02:23.680> smacked<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
team hard so he gets smacked with the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.110 
team hard so he gets smacked with the
psyshock

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
psyshock

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.069

and<00:02:25.739> down<00:02:26.739> goes<00:02:26.890> his<00:02:27.070> Helius<00:02:27.630> back<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.840> comes

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
and down goes his Helius back in comes

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.140 
and down goes his Helius back in comes
his<00:02:29.260> goodra<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.920> don't<00:02:30.130> know<00:02:30.220> why<00:02:30.519> he<00:02:30.820> went<00:02:30.940> back

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
his goodra I don't know why he went back

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.670 
his goodra I don't know why he went back
into<00:02:31.329> his<00:02:31.480> guter<00:02:31.750> here<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.989> be<00:02:32.079> honest<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.500> guess

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
into his guter here to be honest I guess

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.220 
into his guter here to be honest I guess
maybe<00:02:32.950> he<00:02:33.100> thought<00:02:33.250> he<00:02:33.310> could<00:02:33.609> take<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.820> hit<00:02:34.230> but

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
maybe he thought he could take a hit but

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.410 
maybe he thought he could take a hit but
there's<00:02:35.799> nothing<00:02:36.459> he<00:02:36.579> can<00:02:36.730> do<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.910> me<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.180> could

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
there's nothing he can do to me I could

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.640 
there's nothing he can do to me I could
have<00:02:37.510> potentially<00:02:38.049> actually<00:02:38.320> just<00:02:38.470> set<00:02:38.560> up

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
have potentially actually just set up

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.710 
have potentially actually just set up
more<00:02:38.799> coal<00:02:39.010> mines<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.640> thing<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.540> maybe

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
more coal mines on this thing but maybe

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.210 
more coal mines on this thing but maybe
he<00:02:40.900> did<00:02:41.019> have<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> stalks<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.799> that's

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
he did have the stalks of that that's

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.190 
he did have the stalks of that that's
actually<00:02:42.489> probably<00:02:43.209> why<00:02:43.750> he<00:02:43.900> brought<00:02:44.109> it<00:02:44.170> back

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
actually probably why he brought it back

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400 
actually probably why he brought it back
in<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:46.150> I'm<00:02:46.359> just<00:02:46.540> gonna<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:47.290> another

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
in but I'm just gonna go for another

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.120 
in but I'm just gonna go for another
side<00:02:47.769> shock<00:02:48.010> take<00:02:48.220> out<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.519> goodra<00:02:49.060> and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
side shock take out that goodra and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.039 
side shock take out that goodra and
focus<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.400> going<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> rampage<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.900> I

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
focus is just going on a rampage here I

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.660 
focus is just going on a rampage here I
did<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.350> think<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.709> delphox<00:02:54.220> went<00:02:54.519> through

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
did not think that delphox went through

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.330 
did not think that delphox went through
entire<00:02:54.940> teams<00:02:55.239> until<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:56.140> battle<00:02:56.350> he's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
entire teams until this battle he's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.280 
entire teams until this battle he's
gonna<00:02:57.459> bring<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.790> his<00:02:57.940> Venusaur<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.870> make<00:02:59.140> it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
gonna bring in his Venusaur and make it

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.890 
gonna bring in his Venusaur and make it
evolve<00:02:59.530> now<00:02:59.829> but<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> saw<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.180> coming<00:03:01.569> from<00:03:01.690> a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
evolve now but I saw that coming from a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.199 
evolve now but I saw that coming from a
mile<00:03:02.500> away<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:02.980> I'm<00:03:03.400> not<00:03:03.549> gonna<00:03:03.760> go<00:03:03.940> for<00:03:04.120> the

mile away so I'm not gonna go for the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.930 
mile away so I'm not gonna go for the
flamethrower<00:03:05.019> like<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:06.280> might<00:03:06.609> think<00:03:06.850> I

would I'm obviously gonna go for the

would I'm obviously gonna go for the

special defensive walls and in general
