00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
because this this machine is printing

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.399

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
stick and it goes in two steps basically

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.499 
stick and it goes in two steps basically
the<00:01:34.609> Ray<00:01:34.819> goes<00:01:35.060> on<00:01:35.329> first<00:01:35.599> and<00:01:36.369> my<00:01:37.369> name<00:01:37.639> which

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
the Ray goes on first and my name which

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.809 
the Ray goes on first and my name which
is<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.840> flag<00:01:39.139> and<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.829> two<00:01:40.039> dots<00:01:40.310> at<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.729> top

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
is the flag and the two dots at the top

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.359 
is the flag and the two dots at the top
that<00:01:41.479> goes<00:01:41.689> on<00:01:41.929> first<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.770> then<00:01:42.919> the<00:01:43.039> Machine

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
that goes on first and then the Machine

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.209 
that goes on first and then the Machine
comes<00:01:43.669> back<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.329> puts<00:01:44.569> along<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:44.990> black<00:01:45.229> so

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
comes back and puts along the black so
