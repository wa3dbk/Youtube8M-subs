00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
in the right spot but it doesn't look

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.450 
in the right spot but it doesn't look
good<00:02:01.390> now<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.320> is<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.770> looks<00:02:02.980> like<00:02:03.160> when

it's not hurting then you're probably

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.020 
it's not hurting then you're probably
not<00:02:19.180> doing<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.780> good<00:02:19.960> enough<00:02:20.490> remember<00:02:21.490> do<00:02:22.000> not
