00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
thinking the assault strike package is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
thinking the assault strike package is
gonna<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> main<00:01:38.850> thing<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
gonna be the main thing to use it's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
gonna be the main thing to use it's
gonna<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> best<00:01:40.500> strike<00:01:41.250> package<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> use

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
gonna be the best strike package to use

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
gonna be the best strike package to use
and<00:01:42.090> i'm<00:01:42.420> gonna<00:01:42.600> give<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> main<00:01:43.140> reason

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and i'm gonna give you the main reason

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
and i'm gonna give you the main reason
why<00:01:43.619> i<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.549> no<00:01:45.090> lock<00:01:45.899> on

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
why i think that there are no lock on

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.359 
why i think that there are no lock on
launchers<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.740> game<00:01:46.860> there's<00:01:47.040> no<00:01:47.100> lock

with one of your RPGs now that to me is
a<00:02:19.960> tremendous<00:02:20.530> step<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> right<00:02:21.220> direction

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
a tremendous step in the right direction

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.580 
a tremendous step in the right direction
that's<00:02:21.820> why<00:02:21.970> I'm<00:02:22.060> really<00:02:22.450> digging<00:02:22.660> ghosts<00:02:23.020> so

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
that's why I'm really digging ghosts so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.430 
that's why I'm really digging ghosts so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
far I'm i love it man and I'm thinking

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.200 
far I'm i love it man and I'm thinking
that<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.160> tremendous<00:02:27.610> step<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.060> right

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
that it's a tremendous step in the right

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.090 
that it's a tremendous step in the right
direction<00:02:28.240> because<00:02:28.630> cod4<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.740> remember

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
direction because cod4 if you remember

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.490 
direction because cod4 if you remember
cod4<00:02:30.610> was<00:02:31.270> exactly<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> same<00:02:31.990> way<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.170> didn't

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
cod4 was exactly the same way you didn't

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.750 
cod4 was exactly the same way you didn't
have<00:02:32.620> lock<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:33.010> launchers<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.550> got<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
have lock on launchers if you got a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.070 
have lock on launchers if you got a
helicopter<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.570> only<00:02:34.750> way<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.990> we're

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
helicopter the only way that we're

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.810 
helicopter the only way that we're
getting<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.380> down<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:36.070> by<00:02:36.220> shooting<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.700> with

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
getting it down was by shooting it with

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.900 
getting it down was by shooting it with
an<00:02:36.940> RPG<00:02:37.090> luckily<00:02:37.780> or<00:02:38.370> hitting<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.550> with<00:02:39.670> their

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
an RPG luckily or hitting it with their

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.430 
an RPG luckily or hitting it with their
gun<00:02:40.090> which<00:02:40.300> i<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.810> cool<00:02:40.990> because<00:02:41.140> if<00:02:41.350> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
gun which i think is cool because if you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.920 
gun which i think is cool because if you
earn<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> 15<00:02:42.160> kill<00:02:42.370> streak<00:02:42.580> like<00:02:42.790> an<00:02:42.880> ac-130<00:02:43.450> why

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
earn a 15 kill streak like an ac-130 why

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.300 
earn a 15 kill streak like an ac-130 why
should<00:02:44.140> somebody<00:02:44.350> take<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.890> few<00:02:44.920> shots

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
should somebody take just a few shots

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.740 
should somebody take just a few shots
from<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.610> stinger<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.060> take<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.390> down<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.600> think

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
from a stinger and take you down I think

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
from a stinger and take you down I think
that<00:02:46.960> they<00:02:47.050> should<00:02:47.080> be<00:02:47.260> able<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:47.740> should

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
that they should be able they should

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.860 
that they should be able they should
have<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.160> expose<00:02:48.460> themselves<00:02:48.670> by<00:02:49.390> shooting<00:02:49.810> it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
have to expose themselves by shooting it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.330 
have to expose themselves by shooting it
with<00:02:49.990> their<00:02:50.170> gun<00:02:50.350> or<00:02:50.530> something<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:50.980> think

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
with their gun or something like I think

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.650 
with their gun or something like I think
that<00:02:51.460> that's<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.820> best<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> do<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.540> and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
that that's the best way to do it and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.300 
that that's the best way to do it and
because<00:02:53.320> there's<00:02:53.440> no<00:02:53.560> lock<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:53.950> launchers<00:02:54.280> in

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
because there's no lock on launchers in

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.880 
because there's no lock on launchers in
the<00:02:54.490> game<00:02:54.640> once<00:02:54.940> again<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.510> believe<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.740> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
the game once again I believe that the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.590 
the game once again I believe that the
assault<00:02:57.250> strike<00:02:57.550> package<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.090> going<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.510> be

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
assault strike package is going to be

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.490 
assault strike package is going to be
the<00:02:58.900> most<00:02:59.440> quote-unquote<00:03:00.210> overpowered

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the most quote-unquote overpowered

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.390 
the most quote-unquote overpowered
strike<00:03:02.500> package<00:03:02.830> in<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:02.980> game<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.280> gonna

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
strike package in the game it's gonna

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.310 
strike package in the game it's gonna
have<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> best<00:03:03.970> kill<00:03:04.240> streak<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:05.110> think

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
have the best kill streak and I think

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.840 
have the best kill streak and I think
it's<00:03:05.410> gonna<00:03:05.530> be<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.800> one<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.010> we<00:03:06.250> see<00:03:06.460> mostly
