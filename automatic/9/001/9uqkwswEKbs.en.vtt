actually<00:01:23.149> really<00:01:23.630> do<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.409> will<00:01:25.159> say<00:01:25.369> that

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
actually really do like I will say that

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.670 
actually really do like I will say that
if<00:01:25.700> your<00:01:25.850> lips<00:01:26.060> are<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.329> little<00:01:26.420> dry<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:27.350> will

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
if your lips are a little dry it will

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.100 
if your lips are a little dry it will
show<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.549> little<00:01:28.789> bit<00:01:28.969> of<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.149> dryness<00:01:29.539> so<00:01:30.079> I

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
show a little bit of that dryness so I

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.749 
show a little bit of that dryness so I
would<00:01:30.320> highly<00:01:30.680> suggest<00:01:30.710> using<00:01:31.219> a<00:01:31.430> lip<00:01:31.579> balm

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
would highly suggest using a lip balm
