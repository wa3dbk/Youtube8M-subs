model<00:03:18.910> what<00:03:19.540> was<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.810> feedback<00:03:19.989> for<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
model what was the feedback for the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.190 
model what was the feedback for the
previous<00:03:20.920> model<00:03:21.220> oh<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.549> was<00:03:21.670> excellent

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
previous model oh it was excellent

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.600 
previous model oh it was excellent
everybody<00:03:23.200> really<00:03:23.680> loved<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:23.890> curve<00:03:24.340> design

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
everybody really loved that curve design

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.490 
everybody really loved that curve design
and<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.060> curve<00:03:25.269> feature<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:26.140> simply

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and the curve feature just simply

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.470 
and the curve feature just simply
because<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:27.310> felt<00:03:27.579> better<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:28.000> felt<00:03:28.180> better<00:03:28.299> in

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
because it felt better it felt better in

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.150 
because it felt better it felt better in
the<00:03:28.540> hand<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.930> pocket<00:03:29.350> along<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.620> contour<00:03:30.130> of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
the hand and pocket along the contour of

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.400 
the hand and pocket along the contour of
the<00:03:30.250> face<00:03:30.549> there<00:03:31.360> were<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.540> few<00:03:31.810> things<00:03:32.079> that

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
the face there were a few things that

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.289 
the face there were a few things that
we've<00:03:32.829> listened<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.549> feedback<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.239> they

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
we've listened to the feedback and they

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.479 
we've listened to the feedback and they
wanted<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.660> expand<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> memory<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.370> added

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
wanted to expand the memory so we added

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.580 
wanted to expand the memory so we added
a<00:03:36.640> micro<00:03:37.000> SD<00:03:37.329> card<00:03:37.600> support<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.170> 2<00:03:38.350> terabytes

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
a micro SD card support to 2 terabytes

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.530 
a micro SD card support to 2 terabytes
now<00:03:39.430> we<00:03:39.489> know<00:03:39.700> there's<00:03:39.910> not<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> 2<00:03:40.329> terabyte

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
now we know there's not a 2 terabyte

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.930 
now we know there's not a 2 terabyte
micro<00:03:41.170> SD<00:03:41.470> card<00:03:41.709> out<00:03:41.829> there<00:03:42.070> but<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.519> will<00:03:42.670> take

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
micro SD card out there but it will take

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.220 
micro SD card out there but it will take
whatever<00:03:43.329> card<00:03:43.630> if<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.989> want

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
whatever card if you want

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.809 
whatever card if you want
put<00:03:44.379> in<00:03:44.500> there<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:45.160> was<00:03:45.280> another<00:03:45.520> feature

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
put in there that was another feature

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.089 
put in there that was another feature
and<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.180> also<00:03:46.480> screen<00:03:46.840> sites<00:03:47.140> people<00:03:47.650> wanted

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
and then also screen sites people wanted

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.520 
and then also screen sites people wanted
to<00:03:48.129> have<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.459> larger<00:03:48.849> screen<00:03:49.269> but<00:03:49.870> yet<00:03:50.080> have

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
to have the larger screen but yet have

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.020 
to have the larger screen but yet have
it<00:03:50.560> fit<00:03:50.830> more<00:03:51.010> comfortably<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.730> hand<00:03:51.760> in

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
it fit more comfortably in the hand in

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.640 
it fit more comfortably in the hand in
pockets<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.569> we<00:03:52.690> brought<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> from<00:03:53.200> six<00:03:53.470> inches

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
pockets so we brought it from six inches

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.250 
pockets so we brought it from six inches
down<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> five<00:03:54.489> point<00:03:54.790> five<00:03:54.970> minutes<00:03:55.330> but

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
down to a five point five minutes but

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.229 
down to a five point five minutes but
yet<00:03:56.500> we<00:03:56.709> still<00:03:56.739> went<00:03:57.190> edge<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.640> edge<00:03:57.760> with<00:03:58.060> it

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
yet we still went edge to edge with it

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.970 
yet we still went edge to edge with it
so<00:03:58.510> with<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.840> five<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.260> half<00:03:59.319> inches<00:03:59.739> edge

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
so with that five and a half inches edge

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.190 
so with that five and a half inches edge
to<00:04:00.190> edge<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:00.940> still<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> beautiful<00:04:02.019> large

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
to edge it's still a beautiful large

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.199 
to edge it's still a beautiful large
viewing<00:04:02.650> panel<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.489> again<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:05.430> remember<00:04:06.430> you

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
viewing panel that again I remember you

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.509 
viewing panel that again I remember you
I<00:04:07.239> used<00:04:07.599> to<00:04:07.750> review<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.349> previous<00:04:08.680> model<00:04:09.310> and

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
I used to review the previous model and

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.070 
I used to review the previous model and
I<00:04:09.580> remember<00:04:09.970> putting<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> table<00:04:10.930> and

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
I remember putting it on a table and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.759 
I remember putting it on a table and
then<00:04:11.200> use<00:04:11.349> my<00:04:11.500> hands<00:04:14.459> okay<00:04:15.540> let's<00:04:16.540> try<00:04:16.840> pío<00:04:17.320> LED

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
then use my hands okay let's try pío LED

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.590 
then use my hands okay let's try pío LED
display<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.340> still<00:04:18.579> very<00:04:18.790> flexible<00:04:19.479> and

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
display is still very flexible and

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.890 
display is still very flexible and
bendable<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.609> can<00:04:21.790> just<00:04:21.940> like<00:04:22.120> press<00:04:22.660> like

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
bendable so I can just like press like

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:31.560 
bendable so I can just like press like
okay<00:04:28.470> okay<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.860> we<00:04:30.460> did<00:04:30.700> actually<00:04:30.940> increase

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
okay okay and we did actually increase

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.010 
okay okay and we did actually increase
the<00:04:31.810> durability<00:04:32.169> of<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:33.340> device<00:04:33.760> about<00:04:34.150> 30%

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
the durability of the device about 30%

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.469 
the durability of the device about 30%
so<00:04:35.440> having<00:04:36.010> that<00:04:36.220> curved<00:04:36.520> design<00:04:37.000> if<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.330> were

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
so having that curved design if you were

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.540 
so having that curved design if you were
to<00:04:37.570> drop<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.020> flat<00:04:38.260> on<00:04:38.410> its<00:04:38.590> face<00:04:38.830> it's

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
to drop it flat on its face it's

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.200 
to drop it flat on its face it's
actually<00:04:39.880> got<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> 30%<00:04:40.389> stronger<00:04:41.910> ability<00:04:42.910> to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
actually got a 30% stronger ability to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.879 
actually got a 30% stronger ability to
protect<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.810> glass<00:04:43.990> from<00:04:44.050> breakage<00:04:44.680> we've

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
protect the glass from breakage we've

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.740 
protect the glass from breakage we've
added<00:04:45.130> an<00:04:45.310> extra<00:04:45.430> coating<00:04:45.940> on<00:04:46.270> top<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.660> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
added an extra coating on top of the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.270 
added an extra coating on top of the
glass<00:04:46.960> which<00:04:47.620> will<00:04:47.740> actually<00:04:47.919> protect

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
glass which will actually protect

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820 
glass which will actually protect
scratches<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.030> stuff<00:04:49.240> an<00:04:49.330> additional<00:04:49.750> 20%<00:04:50.110> so

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
scratches and stuff an additional 20% so

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.620 
scratches and stuff an additional 20% so
all<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.190> way<00:04:51.280> around<00:04:51.639> we've<00:04:52.210> added<00:04:52.450> that

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
all the way around we've added that

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.540 
all the way around we've added that
chemical<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.620> poly<00:04:53.860> that's<00:04:54.190> really

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
chemical and the poly that's really

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.580 
chemical and the poly that's really
going<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.760> protect<00:04:54.910> this<00:04:55.240> device<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.410> looks

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
going to protect this device so it looks
