00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.469
 Hello, how are you in this video? 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.690
 show how you can weave the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.330
 crab point 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.160
 basically the crab point 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.410
 we weave when it's time to finish doing 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.900
 a finished in our clothes for 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.509
 that is better on the shore 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.119
 finished here I show you with this 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.450
 dress for example the finished one is left 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.210
 in this way something even and we could 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.239
 leave it like that however if we want it 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160
 we remain as with greater finished 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.680
 we can make this point crab that 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.289
 I'm going to show you is a very nice point 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.309
 that instead of it is called crab point 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.309
 because instead of knitting 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.670
 this point is woven back and what 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 we started by weaving a chain and now 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.190
 woven the chain we passed rather we 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.250
 we go back to the previous point 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.770
 in this way we put our hook 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 we take out and with those two centuries the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.440
 we come up with another point again we're going to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 take the previous point that would be this 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.280
 we put out we lasso these two centuries 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.870
 that we have here, we are going to take 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.140
 another released again the previous point 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.330
 we put needle we take out 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.330
 and we take the room again and we take out 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.110
 we put the hook we take out and we go back to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.040
 take out again we put the hook of the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.100
 previous point we take out and here we have 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.520
 two threads 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.190
 and we go back to draw the point again 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.970
 previous would be this we put our 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.240
 hook we take out 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.240
 and we take the room again and we take out 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.260
 the previous point we put the hook there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.730
 we take out and our two threads we take it out 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.890
 and so on until everything is finished 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.590
 back and get here I want you to 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.830
 see the difference between where 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.290
 is using the crab point of this 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.870
 way is how it is and where it is not 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.520
 using this is how it is there is a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.070
 difference and then in which you more 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.890
 like this dress is two views 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.840
 then it does not matter where we do what 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.630
 is this point crab if it is in the part 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.100
 in front or in the back see 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.350
 as it is in the front 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.720
 that's also why it's a nice point 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.880
 because he has neither backhand nor right 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.740
 I hope you liked it and so what 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.940
 Apply to your clothes that are well 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.940
 until next time
