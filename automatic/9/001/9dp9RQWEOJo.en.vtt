and<00:01:48.509> over<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.049> fire<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.469> goes<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.920> percolate

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.760 

I've<00:02:06.209> mentioned<00:02:06.659> before<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.020> maple<00:02:07.530> sap

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I've mentioned before that maple sap

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
I've mentioned before that maple sap
looks<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.340> water<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> pretty<00:02:09.390> much<00:02:09.509> tastes

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
looks like water and pretty much tastes

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.199 
looks like water and pretty much tastes
like<00:02:09.989> water<00:02:10.229> too<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.549> something<00:02:11.760> fun<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
like water too but it's something fun to

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:27.960 
like water too but it's something fun to
try<00:02:12.480> when<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.959> access<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.709> SAP

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:46.740 

the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.360 

although<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.900> change<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.349> flavor<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.830> subtle

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
although the change in flavor is subtle

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.460 
although the change in flavor is subtle
I<00:02:49.400> think<00:02:49.909> maple<00:02:50.239> sap<00:02:50.420> makes<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.840> darn<00:02:51.049> good<00:02:51.140> cup

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
I think maple sap makes a darn good cup

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.750 
I think maple sap makes a darn good cup
of<00:02:51.560> coffee

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.819 

I<00:03:00.819> am<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.569> outsider<00:03:01.989> saying<00:03:02.590> until<00:03:02.980> next<00:03:03.430> time
