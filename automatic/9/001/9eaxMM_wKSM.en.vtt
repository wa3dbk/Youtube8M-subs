00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
kilometers an hour it's like he was like

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.590 
kilometers an hour it's like he was like
full<00:01:04.199> out<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:05.850> running<00:01:06.060> along<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.360> one

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
full out and I'm running along with one
hand<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:10.280> yeah<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.460> reason<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:15.030> doing

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
hand on yeah so so the reason I'm doing

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
hand on yeah so so the reason I'm doing
this<00:01:15.270> comparison<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.289> I<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:17.509> do<00:01:18.509> or

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this comparison is because I I do or

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
this comparison is because I I do or
have<00:01:19.350> done<00:01:19.410> both<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.250> used<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.849> I<00:01:20.940> used<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.209> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
have done both I used to I used to I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.029 
have done both I used to I used to I
used<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.780> skydive<00:01:23.539> I've<00:01:24.539> got<00:01:24.899> maybe<00:01:25.740> it

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
used to skydive I've got maybe it

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.430 
used to skydive I've got maybe it
doesn't<00:01:26.310> jumps<00:01:26.940> which<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.229> isn't

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
doesn't jumps which is it which isn't

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.460 
doesn't jumps which is it which isn't
many<00:01:28.849> but<00:01:29.849> you<00:01:30.149> know<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:31.140> than<00:01:31.319> most

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
many but you know it's more than most

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.790 
many but you know it's more than most
most<00:01:31.860> people<00:01:32.069> do<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.810> once<00:01:33.810> twice<00:01:34.229> three<00:01:34.770> times

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
most people do it once twice three times

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.430 
most people do it once twice three times
and<00:01:35.399> then<00:01:35.489> that's<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.910> I<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:37.170> doing<00:01:37.349> it

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
and then that's it I was doing it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.680 
and then that's it I was doing it
regularly<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:38.069> a<00:01:38.130> while<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:40.429> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
regularly for a while and the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.169 
regularly for a while and the
interesting<00:01:42.690> thing<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:43.020> skydiving<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:44.179> how

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
interesting thing about skydiving is how

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.690 
interesting thing about skydiving is how
quickly<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:47.399> becomes<00:01:47.880> less<00:01:48.509> exciting<00:01:49.670> what<00:01:50.670> i

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
quickly it becomes less exciting what i

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.040 
quickly it becomes less exciting what i
mean<00:01:50.970> by<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> i<00:01:51.239> mean<00:01:51.420> by<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.660> time<00:01:51.869> you've

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
mean by that i mean by the time you've

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.600 
mean by that i mean by the time you've
jumped<00:01:52.349> a<00:01:54.530> very<00:01:55.530> small<00:01:55.890> amount<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.489> maybe

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
jumped a very small amount like maybe

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.859 
jumped a very small amount like maybe
six<00:01:57.030> seven<00:01:57.330> times<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.789> become<00:02:00.060> it's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
six seven times you just you become it's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.369 
six seven times you just you become it's
more<00:02:01.020> about<00:02:01.140> technique<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:04.140> there<00:02:04.259> are

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:04.379 
more about technique because there are

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.990 
more about technique because there are
steps<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.770> need<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> learn<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.910> able

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
steps you need to learn how to be able

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270 
steps you need to learn how to be able
to<00:02:06.239> pull<00:02:06.750> your<00:02:06.869> own<00:02:06.959> cord<00:02:07.319> and<00:02:07.709> EV<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.099> got<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
to pull your own cord and EV you got it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.360 
to pull your own cord and EV you got it
you<00:02:08.369> got<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.289> got<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.500> keep<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.770> pop<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
you got it you got to keep a pop you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.830 
you got it you got to keep a pop you
have<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> give<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> keep<00:02:12.720> a

have to give this you have to keep a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.710 
have to give this you have to keep a
proper<00:02:13.140> falling<00:02:14.030> position<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.300> got<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.540> show

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
proper falling position you got to show

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510 
proper falling position you got to show
the<00:02:16.050> instructors<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.040> control

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the instructors that you have control

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.580 
the instructors that you have control
before<00:02:17.970> they'll<00:02:18.270> allow<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.319> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
before they'll allow you to do this and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
before they'll allow you to do this and
then<00:02:19.800> before<00:02:20.489> they<00:02:20.760> allow<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
then before they allow you to go to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.869 
then before they allow you to go to
higher<00:02:21.569> heights<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.349> longer<00:02:23.190> free<00:02:23.640> fall

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
higher heights and longer free fall

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.869 
higher heights and longer free fall
times<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.540> whatnot<00:02:25.189> so<00:02:26.189> when<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.609> it's

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
times and whatnot so when you go it's

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.620 
times and whatnot so when you go it's
just<00:02:27.209> kind<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.480> smart

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
just kind of smart

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.710 
just kind of smart
I<00:02:29.130> felt<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> end<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.790> was<00:02:30.910> more<00:02:31.120> work<00:02:31.420> than

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
I felt in the end it was more work than

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.830 
I felt in the end it was more work than
fun<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:33.010> with<00:02:33.760> each<00:02:33.970> jump<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.660> just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
fun like with each jump I was just

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.200 
fun like with each jump I was just
trying<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.250> do<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.520> better<00:02:36.820> than<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.180> last

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
trying to do this better than the last

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.090 
trying to do this better than the last
time<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.660> jump<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.500> better<00:02:38.770> than<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
time I jump to do that better than the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.800 
time I jump to do that better than the
last<00:02:39.130> time<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.180> wasn't<00:02:40.360> really<00:02:40.630> enjoying

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
last time and I wasn't really enjoying

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.160 
last time and I wasn't really enjoying
myself<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.350> was<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.620> focusing<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:43.170> improving

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
myself I was just focusing on improving

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.470 
myself I was just focusing on improving
and<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> wasn't<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.730> know<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:48.850> wasn't

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and and it wasn't you know I wasn't

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.309 
and and it wasn't you know I wasn't

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.500 

haha<00:03:01.680> because<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:03.090> great<00:03:04.090> when<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.359> get

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
haha because of great when you get

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.729 
haha because of great when you get
around<00:03:04.659> that<00:03:04.840> corner<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.319> come<00:03:05.469> on<00:03:05.620> to

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
around that corner and you come on to

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.619 
around that corner and you come on to
this<00:03:05.859> park<00:03:06.189> this<00:03:06.639> road<00:03:06.939> like<00:03:07.239> when<00:03:07.359> you<00:03:07.420> finish

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
the corner and it kind of strains up on

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.770 
the corner and it kind of strains up on
to<00:03:09.249> hear<00:03:09.519> there's<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.120> bit<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.389> bump<00:03:10.629> in<00:03:10.749> the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
to hear there's a bit of a bump in the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.629 
to hear there's a bit of a bump in the
road<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.260> know<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.620> bump<00:03:11.859> is<00:03:11.980> there<00:03:12.189> and

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
road and I know that bump is there and

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.069 
road and I know that bump is there and
that<00:03:12.700> bump<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.150> actually<00:03:13.420> screwed<00:03:13.719> me<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.900> few

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
that bump is actually screwed me a few

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.539 
that bump is actually screwed me a few
times<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.409> past<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.799> giving<00:03:15.040> me<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.129> head<00:03:15.280> shake

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
times the past is giving me a head shake

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.740 
times the past is giving me a head shake
because<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.909> come<00:03:16.060> around<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.329> corner<00:03:16.480> and

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
because you come around the corner and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.110 
because you come around the corner and
only<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.260> hit<00:03:17.379> this<00:03:17.500> bump<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.159> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
only in you hit this bump and the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.780 
only in you hit this bump and the
handlebar<00:03:19.510> shake<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.489> for<00:03:21.489> no<00:03:21.609> particular

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
handlebar shake and for no particular

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.580 
handlebar shake and for no particular
reason<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.420> just<00:03:22.629> didn't<00:03:22.840> screw<00:03:23.109> it<00:03:23.260> let's<00:03:23.469> go

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
reason I just didn't screw it let's go

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.839 
reason I just didn't screw it let's go
over<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.829> bump<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.159> high<00:03:24.310> speed<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.670> see<00:03:24.730> what

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
over the bump at high speed and see what

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.909 
over the bump at high speed and see what
happens<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.389> at<00:03:26.079> my<00:03:26.290> front<00:03:26.439> tire<00:03:26.620> when<00:03:26.829> it

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
happens and at my front tire when it

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.699 
happens and at my front tire when it
went<00:03:27.730> off<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:28.000> ground<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.540> actually<00:03:29.079> was<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.680> I

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
went off the ground I actually was and I

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.800 
went off the ground I actually was and I
was<00:03:29.739> still<00:03:29.980> at<00:03:30.129> a<00:03:30.159> lean<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.879> took<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.299> corner

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
was still at a lean so I took the corner

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.409 
was still at a lean so I took the corner
I<00:03:32.340> exited<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.459> corner<00:03:33.819> on<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:36.010> wheel<00:03:36.250> my<00:03:37.180> rear

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
I exited the corner on one wheel my rear

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.129 
I exited the corner on one wheel my rear
had<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.810> lean<00:03:38.079> so<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.120> was<00:03:40.510> smooth<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.079> I

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
had a lean so but it was smooth and I

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.629 
had a lean so but it was smooth and I
didn't<00:03:41.319> get<00:03:41.409> any<00:03:41.560> head<00:03:41.709> shake<00:03:41.949> I<00:03:42.219> probably

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
didn't get any head shake I probably

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.280 
didn't get any head shake I probably
didn't<00:03:43.030> get<00:03:43.120> any<00:03:43.269> head<00:03:43.449> shake<00:03:43.689> because<00:03:43.930> I

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
didn't get any head shake because I

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.629 
didn't get any head shake because I
stayed<00:03:44.530> hard<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.040> gas<00:03:45.159> probably<00:03:45.430> what

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
stayed hard on the gas probably what

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.429 
stayed hard on the gas probably what
normally<00:03:46.030> happens<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.480> i<00:03:46.689> hit<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.900> pump<00:03:47.260> and

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
normally happens is i hit the pump and

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.039 
normally happens is i hit the pump and
maybe<00:03:48.430> my<00:03:48.579> front<00:03:48.849> comes<00:03:49.299> off<00:03:49.480> or<00:03:49.750> starts<00:03:49.959> to

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
maybe my front comes off or starts to

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.229 
maybe my front comes off or starts to
come<00:03:50.199> off<00:03:50.409> and<00:03:50.709> then<00:03:51.129> I<00:03:51.189> panic<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.819> shut<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
come off and then I panic and I shut and

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.030 
come off and then I panic and I shut and
I<00:03:52.299> shut<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.659> gas<00:03:52.810> which<00:03:53.230> puts<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.650> back<00:03:53.769> down

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
I shut the gas which puts it back down

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.830 
I shut the gas which puts it back down
and<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.430> such<00:03:54.639> a<00:03:54.669> shape<00:03:55.329> because<00:03:55.689> it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and then such a shape because it's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.629 
and then such a shape because it's
unstable<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.329> case<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.870> kind<00:03:59.079> of

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
unstable but in this case I kind of

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.129 
unstable but in this case I kind of
expected<00:04:00.639> it<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:00.969> I<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.239> stayed<00:04:01.599> hard<00:04:01.870> on<00:04:02.019> the

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
expected it so I just stayed hard on the

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.619 
expected it so I just stayed hard on the
gas<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.709> went<00:04:03.370> through<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.669> corner<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.000> me

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
gas and I went through the corner on me

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.289 
gas and I went through the corner on me
I<00:04:04.870> exited<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.500> corner<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.769> one<00:04:05.979> wheel<00:04:06.220> and

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
I exited the corner on one wheel and

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.610 
I exited the corner on one wheel and
because<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.449> front<00:04:07.840> wheel<00:04:07.989> didn't<00:04:08.259> come<00:04:08.439> down

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
because the front wheel didn't come down

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.240 
because the front wheel didn't come down
while<00:04:09.159> turning<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.729> didn't<00:04:09.909> get<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.209> hedging

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
while turning I didn't get the hedging

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.860 
while turning I didn't get the hedging
that's<00:04:12.250> my<00:04:12.579> guess

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
that's my guess

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.340 
that's my guess
um

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.199 

so<00:04:18.920> what<00:04:19.100> what<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.490> hell<00:04:19.640> we<00:04:19.820> talking<00:04:20.120> about

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
so what what the hell we talking about

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.600 
so what what the hell we talking about
oh<00:04:20.420> yeah
