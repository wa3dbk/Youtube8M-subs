00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.280
 like any woman who comes to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.670
 a certain milestone 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.039
 I started thinking that I was tired 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.960
 you need a little bit more vitamins 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.360
 slightly more cosmetic procedures 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.099
 but last summer I got out of the car 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.960
 heard the age of a young man 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.200
 girl stand can you 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.419
 meet i turn and he 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.600
 makes a surprised look and says that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.000
 sorry I was mistaken here apparently then I and 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.460
 I realized that the space procedure you already 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.770
 not for me meeting with german about the very 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.840
 led to the fact that I decided 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.999
 I understood exactly total testing 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.089
 what to hate every morning your 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.609
 reflection in the mirror is already tired I probably 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.649
 a surgeon at five or six bypassed but when 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.899
 got him he is enough 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.589
 professionally pamela my face and and 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.899
 said i will write you down 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.180
 operation whenever you want your 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.610
 confidence in what to do to me 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.470
 beautiful probably determined what 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.270
 I did not go for other plastic 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.520
 Surgeons stopped on it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.220
 thermo varnish said that the operation 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.250
 family clinic will be held all 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.409
 who were there all the staff refers to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.509
 you are very friendly indeed 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.590
 entering there I feel that you get 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.939
 big family 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.829
 The purpose of this family is to serve you 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.560
 felt as comfortable as possible 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.340
 everything is built on this ligation 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.710
 Attendance attitude all 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.990
 at a very high level from there not 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.369
 I wanted to leave 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.280
 I really feel calm there 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.170
 in the hands of professionals I have passed 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.930
 just a month after surgery you see 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.729
 what changes nobody gives my 47 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.409
 years I have a young fan 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.070
 who invited me 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.770
 learn salsa and i go i learn salsa 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.060
 last weekend we were in the water park 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.670
 I have two granddaughters 5 6 years old naturally 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.880
 they shouted at the whole water park grandmother 100 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.870
 and grandma show shark me in an hour 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.490
 I already wanted to write on my forehead 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 Herman is better plastic surgeon 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.080
 because you have no idea how much 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.690
 people turned to me and not only 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.110
 women, I think that very many 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.060
 will apply at least for doom 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.550
 the streets on changing your life 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.890
 and because this operation carries 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.380
 qualitative change of life of course i 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 very grateful to Edward Vadimovich for 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.680
