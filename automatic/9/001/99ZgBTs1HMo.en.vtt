00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
rocks but I guess he considered dragon I

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.569 
rocks but I guess he considered dragon I
had<00:00:55.570> nothing<00:00:55.870> with<00:00:55.989> threat<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.649> exploding

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
had nothing with threat that exploding

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.930

was the thing to do so he did on the
plus<00:01:01.120> side<00:01:01.149> he<00:01:01.480> did<00:01:01.510> not<00:01:01.750> get<00:01:01.899> up<00:01:02.020> with<00:01:02.140> stealth

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379

out later so I sent in my jirachi which

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.670 
out later so I sent in my jirachi which
is<00:01:07.119> obviously<00:01:07.479> legit<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.229> he<00:01:08.289> sends<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.649> his

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
he trained and I'm pretty sure this is

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.240 
he trained and I'm pretty sure this is
not<00:01:10.450> gonna<00:01:10.570> be<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.690> scarf<00:01:11.020> trend<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.619> as<00:01:11.830> long<00:01:12.190> as

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
ridiculously well so by doing that I do

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.160 
ridiculously well so by doing that I do
get<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.000> pair<00:01:19.180> hacks<00:01:19.450> but<00:01:19.690> I<00:01:19.780> know<00:01:19.840> he<00:01:20.020> went

my<00:02:18.870> men<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.380> i<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.560> hit<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.800> drink<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.099> meteor

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
my men so i can hit and drink a meteor

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.390 
my men so i can hit and drink a meteor
on<00:02:20.459> any<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.269> aforementioned<00:02:22.130> pokemon<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
on any of the aforementioned pokemon and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
on any of the aforementioned pokemon and
he<00:02:23.550> sends<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.000> breloom<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
he sends in a breloom so it's really it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.290 
he sends in a breloom so it's really it
was<00:02:25.349> an<00:02:25.410> amazing<00:02:25.650> play<00:02:26.069> for<00:02:26.310> me<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.269> really

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
was an amazing play for me and it really

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.470 
was an amazing play for me and it really
probably<00:02:27.780> saved<00:02:28.080> me<00:02:28.230> from<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.500> bind<00:02:28.769> there<00:02:29.480> by

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
probably saved me from a bind there by

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.420 
probably saved me from a bind there by
switching<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:31.950> he's<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.310> go

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
switching it so now he's going to go

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.259 
switching it so now he's going to go
back<00:02:32.760> into<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.209> heatran<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.459> i<00:02:35.459> do<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:36.120> for

back into that heatran and i do go for

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.180 
back into that heatran and i do go for
the<00:02:36.360> obvious<00:02:36.480> fire<00:02:36.930> glass<00:02:37.140> cuz<00:02:37.440> i<00:02:37.470> do<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:37.950> feel

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
I was yeah so that is going to be the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.600 
I was yeah so that is going to be the
end<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.470> Heatran<00:02:46.890> which<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.430> good

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
end of Heatran which is really good

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.580 
end of Heatran which is really good
because<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.209> jirachi<00:02:48.750> has<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.470> its

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
because now that jirachi has one of its

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.449 
because now that jirachi has one of its
main<00:02:49.830> counters<00:02:50.340> taken<00:02:50.910> out<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.360> way<00:02:52.459> which

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
main counters taken out of the way which

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.680 
main counters taken out of the way which
again<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.390> good<00:02:54.569> um<00:02:55.970> he's<00:02:56.970> gonna<00:02:57.510> go

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
again is really good um he's gonna go

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.520 
again is really good um he's gonna go
into<00:02:57.900> wild<00:02:58.200> proofs<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.900> I'm<00:03:00.900> expecting<00:03:01.440> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
into wild proofs and I'm expecting a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.170 
into wild proofs and I'm expecting a
scarf<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.549> why<00:03:02.790> else<00:03:03.000> would<00:03:03.150> you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
scarf because like why else would you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.360 
scarf because like why else would you
send<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.690> Tyrannosaur<00:03:04.500> against<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> brick

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
send in a Tyrannosaur against the brick

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.990 
send in a Tyrannosaur against the brick
breaking<00:03:05.630> settlements<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.519> thought<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
breaking settlements so I thought the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240 
breaking settlements so I thought the
Stone<00:03:09.209> Age<00:03:09.239> was<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.930> obvious<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:11.010> could

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
Stone Age was really obvious and I could

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.460 
Stone Age was really obvious and I could
have<00:03:11.340> easily<00:03:11.519> gone<00:03:11.940> into<00:03:12.359> jirachi<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.350> was

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
have easily gone into jirachi so I was

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.710 
have easily gone into jirachi so I was
checking<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.310> sending<00:03:14.910> latias<00:03:15.269> his<00:03:15.510> death

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
checking to see sending latias his death

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.550 
checking to see sending latias his death
water<00:03:16.019> just<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.500> see<00:03:16.769> what<00:03:16.980> he<00:03:17.069> was<00:03:17.160> gonna<00:03:17.340> do

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
water just to see what he was gonna do

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.550 
water just to see what he was gonna do
turns<00:03:19.560> out<00:03:19.769> he<00:03:20.220> goes<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.790> stone<00:03:21.329> edge

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
turns out he goes for that stone edge

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.020 
turns out he goes for that stone edge
which<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> mean<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.040> good<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.370> bad<00:03:23.579> because<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
which I mean is good and bad because I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.270 
which I mean is good and bad because I
mean<00:03:24.239> if<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.510> had<00:03:24.540> just<00:03:24.750> played<00:03:25.109> how<00:03:25.889> I<00:03:25.920> would

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
mean if I had just played how I would

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.240 
mean if I had just played how I would
have<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.880> could<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.329> saved<00:03:27.630> my<00:03:27.930> lady<00:03:28.200> ace<00:03:28.410> but

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
have I could have saved my lady ace but

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.099 
have I could have saved my lady ace but
I<00:03:29.310> guess<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:29.790> nice<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.209> be<00:03:30.269> conservative<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
I guess it's nice to be conservative and

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.199 
I guess it's nice to be conservative and
I<00:03:31.440> do<00:03:31.500> predict<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.310> play<00:03:32.549> right<00:03:32.579> here<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.120> it

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
I do predict this play right here and it

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.940 
I do predict this play right here and it
was<00:03:33.299> also<00:03:33.480> pretty<00:03:33.840> nice<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.410> know<00:03:34.470> he's<00:03:34.799> going

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
was also pretty nice I know he's going

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.650 
was also pretty nice I know he's going
to<00:03:35.010> go<00:03:35.160> into<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.430> thing<00:03:35.819> expecting<00:03:36.420> me<00:03:36.540> to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
to go into that thing expecting me to

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.020 
to go into that thing expecting me to
t-wave<00:03:37.109> since<00:03:37.889> he<00:03:38.100> probably<00:03:38.489> doesn't<00:03:38.910> want

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
t-wave since he probably doesn't want

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.660 
t-wave since he probably doesn't want
anything<00:03:39.269> else<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.720> his<00:03:39.840> team<00:03:39.870> thunder<00:03:40.470> waved

um<00:04:03.170> unfortunately<00:04:04.170> here<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.769> go<00:04:04.950> for<00:04:05.099> iron<00:04:05.250> head

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
um unfortunately here I go for iron head

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.770 
um unfortunately here I go for iron head
um<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:07.430> kind<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.549> psyched<00:04:08.820> myself<00:04:09.030> out<00:04:09.479> I

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
um I kind of psyched myself out I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.569 
um I kind of psyched myself out I
thought<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.590> fire<00:04:10.799> punch<00:04:11.040> would<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.370> take

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
thought the fire punch would not take
