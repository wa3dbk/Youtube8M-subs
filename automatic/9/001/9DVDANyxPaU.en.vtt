00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
through there it's gonna help create a

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.659 
through there it's gonna help create a
little<00:00:31.560> bit<00:00:31.680> more<00:00:31.740> airflow<00:00:32.009> along<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.550> back

you can probably trim it down a little
bit<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.550> your<00:01:06.360> trim<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.690> weight<00:01:06.900> off<00:01:07.050> of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
bit of your trim a little weight off of

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:07.490 
bit of your trim a little weight off of
it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.520 
it
it<00:01:08.130> does<00:01:08.399> come<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:09.540> attached<00:01:09.899> rain<00:01:10.290> fly

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it does come with an attached rain fly

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.289 
it does come with an attached rain fly
and<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> real<00:01:11.670> heavy<00:01:11.909> thick

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and this is a real heavy thick

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.660 
and this is a real heavy thick
polyurethane<00:01:12.780> coated<00:01:13.469> nylon<00:01:13.649> so<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
polyurethane coated nylon so this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
polyurethane coated nylon so this
definitely<00:01:15.060> asked<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> weight<00:01:16.219> it<00:01:17.219> is<00:01:17.399> sewn

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
definitely asked the weight it is sewn

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
definitely asked the weight it is sewn
in<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> razor<00:01:19.200> blade<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.619> take<00:01:19.770> care<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
in so a razor blade will take care of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.030 
in so a razor blade will take care of
that<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.399> quickly

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.300 

on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.310> portion<00:01:29.580> here<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:31.130> two<00:01:32.130> ice

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
on the back portion here you get two ice

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
on the back portion here you get two ice
two<00:01:32.580> loops<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> single

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
two loops and then a single

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.880 
two loops and then a single
mountaineering<00:01:34.440> ax

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
mountaineering ax

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
mountaineering ax
with<00:01:35.729> three<00:01:35.909> different<00:01:36.210> attachment<00:01:36.659> points
