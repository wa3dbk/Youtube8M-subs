00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
mix up the basics so you're going to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.630 
mix up the basics so you're going to
take<00:00:32.850> shower<00:00:34.399> some<00:00:35.399> water<00:00:36.950> like<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.370> bit

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

baking<00:00:39.510> powder<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.969> then<00:00:41.969> two<00:00:42.840> eggs<00:00:43.370> speaking

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
baking powder and then two eggs speaking

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970 
baking powder and then two eggs speaking
of<00:00:44.430> eggs<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.600> never<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.200> sure<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.739> eggs

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
of eggs you can never be sure that eggs

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.850 
of eggs you can never be sure that eggs
are<00:00:47.219> spoiled<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> super

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
are spoiled so I have the super

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670 
are spoiled so I have the super
efficient<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> determining<00:00:51.360> whether<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
efficient way of determining whether and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.180 
efficient way of determining whether and
the<00:00:53.219> eggs<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:54.600> still<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.590> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the eggs you have are still good so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
the eggs you have are still good so
basically<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> take<00:00:58.109> one

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
basically you're just going to take one

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.939 
basically you're just going to take one
of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.190> eggs<00:01:00.020> crack<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.260> open<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:04.739> not

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of the two eggs crack it open it's not

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.370 
of the two eggs crack it open it's not
opening<00:01:05.720> ok<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:08.220> opened<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.380> then

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
opening ok now it's opened and then

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
opening ok now it's opened and then
you're<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.240> drink<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:15.229> like

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you're just going to and drink it like

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.179 
you're just going to and drink it like
so<00:01:16.590> yeah<00:01:18.439> okay<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.540> yet<00:01:22.189> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
so yeah okay so that one was yet so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
so yeah okay so that one was yet so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
therefore follows that the other one

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
therefore follows that the other one
must<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.790> too<00:01:27.720> ok<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.100> crack<00:01:29.670> open<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
must be too ok so just crack open the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.480 
must be too ok so just crack open the
other<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:32.990> perfect<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:35.130> we're<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
other one perfect so now we're just

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
so okay this is perfect so at this point

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.180
