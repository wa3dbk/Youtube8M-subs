controller<00:00:32.780> product<00:00:33.380> okay<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:33.980> we're<00:00:34.250> going

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
controller product okay so we're going

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.680 
controller product okay so we're going
to<00:00:34.399> talk<00:00:34.579> about<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.970> boost<00:00:35.149> controller<00:00:35.510> in

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
to talk about the boost controller in

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.229 
to talk about the boost controller in
this<00:00:35.750> video<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.770> guess<00:00:37.160> we<00:00:37.460> can<00:00:37.610> maybe<00:00:38.030> start

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
this video I guess we can maybe start

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.340 
this video I guess we can maybe start
going<00:00:38.480> down<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.690> line<00:00:38.899> of<00:00:39.079> some<00:00:39.200> of<00:00:39.290> the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
going down the line of some of the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.200 
going down the line of some of the
features<00:00:39.469> sure<00:00:40.309> well<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:40.700> know<00:00:40.910> there's<00:00:41.090> been

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
features sure well you know there's been

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.819 
features sure well you know there's been
boost<00:00:41.480> controllers<00:00:41.989> on<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.170> market<00:00:42.620> for<00:00:42.800> a

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
long time so it's Automator entering

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.319 
long time so it's Automator entering
this<00:00:45.440> market<00:00:45.500> we<00:00:46.430> wanted<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.850> bring<00:00:47.059> some<00:00:47.300> new

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
this market we wanted to bring some new

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that in your car you guys doing some

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.609 
that in your car you guys doing some
safety<00:01:23.029> features<00:01:23.389> as<00:01:23.539> well<00:01:23.689> well<00:01:24.319> we<00:01:24.409> did

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
safety features as well well we did

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.010 
safety features as well well we did
there's<00:01:24.829> a<00:01:24.920> fail-safe<00:01:25.219> to<00:01:25.700> items<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.869> you

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
there's a fail-safe to items that you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.109 
there's a fail-safe to items that you
can<00:01:27.200> program<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.279> if<00:01:28.399> you're<00:01:28.549> starting<00:01:28.759> to

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
can program in so if you're starting to

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.690 
can program in so if you're starting to
experience<00:01:29.569> overboost<00:01:30.289> and<00:01:30.649> nobody<00:01:31.310> wants

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
experience overboost and nobody wants

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.349 
experience overboost and nobody wants
over<00:01:32.359> boost<00:01:32.599> we<00:01:33.259> open<00:01:34.099> the<00:01:34.219> wastegate<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.969> I

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
over boost we open the wastegate and I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.519 
over boost we open the wastegate and I
bring<00:01:35.599> the<00:01:35.749> boost<00:01:35.929> pressure<00:01:36.139> down

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:36.529 
bring the boost pressure down

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.260 
bring the boost pressure down
automatically<00:01:37.429> and<00:01:37.579> that's<00:01:37.700> through<00:01:37.909> our<00:01:38.029> pro

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
automatically and that's through our pro

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.659 
automatically and that's through our pro
control<00:01:38.659> output<00:01:38.950> circuitry<00:01:39.950> alright<00:01:40.579> and

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:40.669 
control output circuitry alright and

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:42.609 
control output circuitry alright and
then<00:01:40.789> what<00:01:40.939> about<00:01:41.029> logging<00:01:41.779> or<00:01:42.229> maybe<00:01:42.409> being

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
then what about logging or maybe being

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.870 
then what about logging or maybe being
able<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.859> go<00:01:43.009> back<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:43.459> how<00:01:43.520> much<00:01:43.579> boost

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
able to go back and see how much boost

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.760 
able to go back and see how much boost
you<00:01:44.090> ran<00:01:44.270> if<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:44.630> didn't<00:01:44.899> you're<00:01:45.289> I<00:01:45.349> wasn't

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
you ran if you didn't you're I wasn't

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.499 
you ran if you didn't you're I wasn't
quick<00:01:45.889> enough<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.189> catch<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.520> well<00:01:47.270> we<00:01:47.359> have<00:01:47.450> a

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
quick enough to catch it well we have a

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.449 
quick enough to catch it well we have a
two<00:01:47.719> different<00:01:48.109> item<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:48.560> there's<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.859> one-putt

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
two different item so there's a one-putt

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.959 
two different item so there's a one-putt
one-button<00:01:50.739> peak<00:01:51.739> recall<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:52.459> you<00:01:52.549> can<00:01:52.729> see

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
one-button peak recall so you can see

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.449 
one-button peak recall so you can see
where<00:01:53.149> your<00:01:53.329> maximum<00:01:53.929> boost<00:01:54.200> was<00:01:54.499> and<00:01:54.859> then<00:01:55.310> we

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
where your maximum boost was and then we

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.229 
where your maximum boost was and then we
actually<00:01:55.639> have<00:01:56.090> data<00:01:56.659> logging<00:01:57.079> output<00:01:57.469> for

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
actually have data logging output for

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.599 
actually have data logging output for
your<00:01:59.239> boost<00:01:59.479> over<00:01:59.899> time<00:02:00.139> and<00:02:00.529> we<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.039> output

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
your boost over time and we can output

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.549 
your boost over time and we can output
that<00:02:01.789> either<00:02:02.059> an<00:02:02.270> absolute<00:02:02.869> pressure<00:02:03.139> or
