00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.210
 these things we've just seen 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.880
 call monkey and to practice this 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.080
 move you have to have a high wall like 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.619
 how much the basin and after that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 the training of the mont that yes yes 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.840
 put their hands on the wall and yes 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 they put it almost like events one does from 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.200
 other times until you take 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.100
 confidence with one ear and after that 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.280
 expect a bit of confidence like 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.730
 muretto you can make the title proper in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.730
 this way 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.450
 this I know that you have just seen is 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.250
 very simple because he already knows how to do the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.020
 roll which in practice is the somersault 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.270
 restart that you do so put it of 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:05.050
 all two hands on the ground like this 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:08.770
 so and then you see what a private habit of 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:13.000
 it is the somersault of the dark and if you don't know 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.100
 already making this game you don't feel 50 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.890
 you have to dive over in online star 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.090
 another way to just dive into the obstacle 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:28.990
 with your hands forward 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 then do it so this move is 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.270
 another pretty nice show yes 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.680
 call to usher and in practice you must 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.560
 have a low wall in an obstacle ad 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.630
 be pelvis like like with the monkey e 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.340
 so game you are like the monkey that you are 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.560
 he puts his hands and then pushes himself into it 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.360
 forward only that it is on the contrary before you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.950
 skip all the obstacle and then killed 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.009
 from pushing back with hands like 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.380
 we have seen before in practice 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.590
 training and so skip the obstacle 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.580
 so stay so president and then 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.580
 view transcribing 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.170
 especially always this climbs of 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.780
 sit on tap and so on until 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.630
 when you won't do it very quickly 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 and knows why you have become familiar with 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.290
 the wall can be made from xavi here 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.040
 then practice this move that made 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.930
 and as a symbol lady that in practice 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.280
 very simple you put your hands to the two 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.410
 opposite sides of the surrounding wall 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.390
 on the other hand he says why we have what he has 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.100
 fact is called symbol and now we will go 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.490
 to explain the thing I had done on 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.430
 video you put your hands on the data and almost 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:59.110
 that moretti is a practical training e 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:04.330
 this will be the wall and then contracts 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.520
 60 and on what is said after that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.170
 you have taken some confidence with 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.590
 the training gets the vice that is done 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.320
 the motion 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 and then this move he barely had 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.230
 seen 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.720
 we come back with a moretto 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.410
 long enough I ca n't do it in 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:43.140
 this wall then the pelvis arms 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:43.140
 as a workout 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:15.959
 this mass the lady because then 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.419
 quite simple, just put a motorcycle 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:24.960
 on the wall and with the other go in 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:36.780
 here so only that then okay now 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:39.570
 see this is this then 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.220
 move is very simple and i need 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.889
 places don't leave to step over one 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.190
 obstacle so put your hand on one 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:50.280
 first and foremost, raise your hand 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.169
 that raises re times corresponding to the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.550
 hand such that right there 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.240
 this thing but not to be must raise 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.370
 the right 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.430
 in this way and after that his 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:05.220
 seen so perfect it is open a 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:10.500
 training and you will put those 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:13.830
 of then practically after putting 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.640
 the hand that raised the foot rises 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.890
 also the other foot 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.900
 then the hand is put there and there 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.900
 goes on an exchange of hands so 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.740
 Now put all the music together 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:29.949
 the man seen and we will do a little 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.949
 route 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.650
 I am simone with what does parkour 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.509
 and he john and that's what 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.460
 he took all my videos because there 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.909
 both liked and the next 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.909
 Hello
