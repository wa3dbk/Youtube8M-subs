if<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:55.920> wanted<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.420> what<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.510> did<00:00:57.629> find<00:00:57.929> out

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
if he wanted to what we did find out

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
if he wanted to what we did find out
though<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> some<00:00:58.679> guys<00:00:58.829> did<00:00:59.129> want<00:00:59.399> timing

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
though is some guys did want timing

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
though is some guys did want timing
control<00:01:00.570> guys<00:01:01.320> running<00:01:01.649> boosted<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.489> know

supercharged applications want to be
able<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> control<00:01:04.739> their<00:01:04.920> ignition<00:01:05.280> timing

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
able to control their ignition timing

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
able to control their ignition timing
and<00:01:05.759> that's<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.570> came<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> p3

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and that's where we came out with the p3

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
and that's where we came out with the p3
plus<00:01:07.829> it's<00:01:08.400> basically<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> power<00:01:09.329> jection<00:01:09.689> 3

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
plus it's basically a power jection 3

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
plus it's basically a power jection 3
with<00:01:10.920> additional<00:01:11.610> spark<00:01:11.939> control<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
with additional spark control so this is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.210 
with additional spark control so this is
all<00:01:13.259> one<00:01:13.560> unit<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.579> unit<00:01:14.970> we've<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
all one unit all one unit we've got a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
all one unit all one unit we've got a
ignition<00:01:17.220> system<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.729> along<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.240> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
ignition system to go along with it it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
ignition system to go along with it it's
a<00:01:18.899> two<00:01:19.259> wire<00:01:19.439> distributor<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> could<00:01:20.369> be

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
a two wire distributor but it could be

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.810 
a two wire distributor but it could be
used<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.759> any<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.689> standard<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:23.610> wire

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
used with any of the standard to wire

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.490

what<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> power<00:01:26.399> increases<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.329> see

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
what kind of power increases can we see

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
what kind of power increases can we see
out<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.869> unit<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:29.189> I'd<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
out of a unit like this what I'd like to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.480 
out of a unit like this what I'd like to
say<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.939> um<00:01:30.149> timing<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> great<00:01:31.350> tool<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.130> gas

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
say is um timing is a great tool for gas

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
say is um timing is a great tool for gas
mileage<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.210> guy<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.840> increase<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.500> timing

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
mileage a guy can increase his timing

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.800 
mileage a guy can increase his timing
while<00:01:35.549> he's<00:01:35.700> driving<00:01:35.820> down<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> road<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
while he's driving down the road you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.240 
while he's driving down the road you
know<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.049> necessarily<00:01:37.200> under<00:01:37.829> wide<00:01:37.979> open

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
know not necessarily under wide open

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
know not necessarily under wide open
throttle<00:01:38.399> but<00:01:38.700> while<00:01:39.180> he's<00:01:39.299> driving<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
throttle but while he's driving on the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.420 
throttle but while he's driving on the
freeway<00:01:39.899> and<00:01:40.140> definitely<00:01:40.799> pick<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.310> more

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
freeway and definitely pick up some more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.880 
freeway and definitely pick up some more
efficiency<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.479> obviously<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.170> reliability

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
efficiency and obviously the reliability

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
efficiency and obviously the reliability
factor<00:01:44.070> comes<00:01:44.399> into<00:01:44.700> play<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.030> well<00:01:45.240> well<00:01:45.840> with

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
factor comes into play as well well with

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
factor comes into play as well well with
the<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.350> always<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.979> reliability

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the if I always have that reliability

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.800 
the if I always have that reliability
and<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.090> we're<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.240> looking<00:01:48.270> for

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and that's what we're all looking for

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.240 
and that's what we're all looking for
you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.619> put<00:01:49.740> together<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.070> real

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you know you can put together a real
