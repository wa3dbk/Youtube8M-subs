00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
a kayak a little advantage you have it
being<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.410> kayak<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.160> disadvantage<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
being a kayak and disadvantage is it

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.400 
being a kayak and disadvantage is it
takes<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.450> while<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> get<00:00:12.960> from<00:00:13.139> spot<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
takes you a while to get from spot to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.189 
takes you a while to get from spot to
spot<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.130> advantage<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.750> control

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
spot but the advantage is you control

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.930 
spot but the advantage is you control
behind<00:00:16.619> while<00:00:17.010> paddling<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
behind while paddling and it's going to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.230 
behind while paddling and it's going to
mimic<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.630> action<00:00:19.520> for<00:00:20.520> instance<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:21.029> here

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240

him or anything like that you can see
the<00:01:33.270> action<00:01:33.630> tip<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.079> rod<00:01:34.610> there<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> just

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the action tip of the rod there and just

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
the action tip of the rod there and just
make<00:01:37.380> sure<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.799> drag<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.280> set<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> where<00:01:38.880> if

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
make sure your drag is set to where if

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.639 
make sure your drag is set to where if
you<00:01:39.500> catch<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.590> fish<00:01:40.799> or<00:01:41.899> get<00:01:42.899> hot<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.289> something

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you catch a fish or get hot on something

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.810 
you catch a fish or get hot on something
hopefully<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.039> don't<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.310> hung<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.610> anything

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
hopefully you don't get hung on anything

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.179 
hopefully you don't get hung on anything
but<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.610> able<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.649> hear<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.920> drag

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
but you will be able to hear the drag

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
but you will be able to hear the drag
going<00:01:50.549> off<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.149> another<00:01:51.330> thing<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.600> recommend

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
going off it's another thing I recommend

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.429 
going off it's another thing I recommend
is<00:01:52.170> getting<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.880> reel<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.840> clicker<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
is getting a reel that has a clicker on

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.240 
is getting a reel that has a clicker on
it<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:57.350> when<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> drag<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> set<00:01:59.009> loose

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it so that when the drag is set loose

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.850 
it so that when the drag is set loose
and<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.030> fish<00:02:00.330> or<00:02:00.659> anything<00:02:00.840> starts<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.619> take

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and a fish or anything starts to take

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.990 
and a fish or anything starts to take
that<00:02:02.360> bait<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:05.130> lure<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.789> on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that bait or that that lure you have on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.620 
that bait or that that lure you have on
out<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:07.259> hear<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.729> as<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:08.970> doing<00:02:09.149> here<00:02:09.269> so
