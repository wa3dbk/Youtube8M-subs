all these fabrics also have like inner
ends<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:12.300> know<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.660> rental<00:03:13.080> properties

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
ends you know in the rental properties

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.700 
ends you know in the rental properties
so<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.640> really<00:03:14.940> something<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.320> think

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
so it's really something that is I think

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.670 
so it's really something that is I think
if<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.460> can<00:03:17.640> design<00:03:17.820> cool<00:03:18.570> pants<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.260> all<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
if you can design cool pants is all that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.270 
if you can design cool pants is all that
makes<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:20.040> proportion<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:21.210> fabric<00:03:22.280> probably

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
makes a proportion right fabric probably

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.180 
makes a proportion right fabric probably
right<00:03:23.840> wash<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.560> number<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:25.920> time<00:03:26.100> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
right wash and the number of time you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.320 
right wash and the number of time you
wear<00:03:26.430> them

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.540 

yeah<00:03:33.960> yeah<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.380> think<00:03:34.530> hold<00:03:34.890> perfectly<00:03:35.130> on<00:03:35.460> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
yeah yeah I think hold perfectly on the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.190 
yeah yeah I think hold perfectly on the
body<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:35.910> they<00:03:36.300> look<00:03:36.600> like<00:03:36.810> you're<00:03:37.020> losing

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
body but they look like you're losing

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.160 
body but they look like you're losing
them<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.390> thing<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.080> am

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
them and this is the thing is like I am

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.380 
them and this is the thing is like I am
losing<00:03:40.560> my<00:03:40.860> pants<00:03:41.130> all<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.340> time<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:42.030> don't

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
losing my pants all the time I don't

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.270 
losing my pants all the time I don't
have<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.570> little<00:03:42.840> thing<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:44.070> them

have that little thing that make them
hold<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:44.670> my<00:03:44.820> body

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.550 

it's<00:03:58.750> interesting<00:03:58.900> because<00:03:59.230> I've<00:03:59.409> been

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
it's interesting because I've been

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.679 
it's interesting because I've been
watching<00:04:00.010> him<00:04:00.040> for<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.670> while<00:04:00.879> they're<00:04:01.360> like

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689

producing<00:05:23.949> the<00:05:24.039> clothes<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:28.810> marry

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
producing the clothes you marry

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.059 
producing the clothes you marry
commercial<00:05:31.120> clothes<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:31.960> I<00:05:32.259> mean<00:05:32.529> that<00:05:32.560> in<00:05:32.830> a

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
commercial clothes and I mean that in a

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.950 
commercial clothes and I mean that in a
good<00:05:33.099> way<00:05:33.310> it's<00:05:33.610> not<00:05:33.729> a<00:05:33.789> bad<00:05:34.029> word<00:05:34.270> commercial

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
good way it's not a bad word commercial

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.619 
good way it's not a bad word commercial
is<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.139> bad<00:05:35.319> word<00:05:35.560> clothes<00:05:36.520> that<00:05:36.909> can<00:05:37.270> sell

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
is a bad word clothes that can sell

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.740 
is a bad word clothes that can sell
because<00:05:38.110> women<00:05:38.770> can<00:05:38.979> wear<00:05:39.159> them<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.879> think

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
because women can wear them I think

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.779 
because women can wear them I think
that's<00:05:40.900> really<00:05:41.319> really<00:05:42.250> great<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:42.610> think

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
that's really really great I think

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.700 
that's really really great I think
that's<00:05:43.029> what<00:05:43.270> we've<00:05:43.569> seen<00:05:43.930> with<00:05:43.990> Olivier

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
that's what we've seen with Olivier

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.340 
that's what we've seen with Olivier
coming<00:05:45.189> to<00:05:45.400> theory

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350
