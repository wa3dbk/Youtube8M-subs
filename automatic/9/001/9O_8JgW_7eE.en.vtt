00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.230
 asus memo pad memo pad is not just a 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.770
 product but is a family of products 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.050
 we have memo pad hd7 which is a tablet 7 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.480
 thumbs and here to taipei's computex 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.060
 we also launched full hd memo pads 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.339
 10 as we understand from the name we are 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.789
 talking about a 10 inch full product 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.240
 hd 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.380
 especially full memo pad products 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.210
 hd 10 are two 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.880
 not just because we have a version 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.320
 wifi is a 4g version 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.270
 we begin to see product details 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.660
 then let's see the differences between 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.140
 the two versions are wifi and 40 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:46.240
 we have a 10 inch full hd panel 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:49.180
 therefore 1900 20 x 1080 particularly 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.880
 thin with this plastic material 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.320
 with a very good feel to the touch 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.690
 good very positive and very important 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.540
 the power of processors the power of 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.089
 processors on tablets is undergoing a 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.290
 substantial increase we say follow 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.290
 a little bit the law of moore 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.689
 they increase exponentially to what 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.200
 serves this power serves precisely for 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.250
 manage the full hd then the graphics 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.479
 full hd 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.180
 here we see how quickly he responds 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.390
 the screen to our touch we can 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.640
 sail safely in absolute 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.920
 we have fluidity as in all 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.240
 asus products access to google play 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.630
 therefore all the products are certified 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.909
 the play to take advantage of all the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.470
 applications all the functions there 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.920
 provides google on his 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.920
 market 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.270
 in particular we have said precisely 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.360
 we talked wifi the 4g product the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.939
 wifi product is equipped with a processor 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.969
 atom intel dual core in a gigabyte and 6 of 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.649
 frequency while the 4g product is 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.490
 equipped with a quad core processor 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.280
 qualcomm quad core always maximum 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.710
 power a jig in the middle of frequency 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.140
 the qualcomm processor I said before 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.739
 let a passerby to the lines support the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.209
 4g then the network that is the network that 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.160
 even in Italy now it starts to be 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.410
 available and allows you to browse at 100 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.780
 megabits per second then well beyond 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.120
 speed that they are in a home adsl 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.299
 on our products we then have one 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.610
 software suite we have the super note 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.590
 light which is this application that there 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.590
 allows you to take notes 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 using the touch panel and we can 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.530
 we can write take notes on 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.470
 on the screen we can now write 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.350
 hello here a page a little dirty and there 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.950
 is reported say on 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.030
 on the sheet format we have chosen 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.610
 previously among the various 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.900
 applications we are studying that is 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.910
 an application that allows us to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.670
 organize our photos by putting gods 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.110
 tag after making see photo photos 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.820
 rather than videos in a giving way 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.400
 having categorized you when 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.970
 we will go there and then we will go looking 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.100
 we never bit base morning cast 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.690
 in fake all the applications you need 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.760
 let's say ni in a social environment for 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.370
 aggregate the information a little bit 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.480
 they come from facebook twitter google 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.959
 plus and all the various 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.110
 the various social networks we have to do one 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.790
 hardware overview of this 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 product we have just said a 10 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.580
 inch with full hd screen 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.500
 we have the front camera and one 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.959
 rear camera 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.480
 we have two stereo speakers then 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.010
 we have the sonic master that is 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.530
 always the technology of asus that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.690
 allows you to improve audio quality 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.409
 we have a port for a jack for 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.959
 connect a headphone to a headphone 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.950
 ignition for this part we have one 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.590
 microsd slot to expand memory 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.950
 up to 32GB integrated memory is 16 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.290
 gb 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.140
 we can put the other 32 micro sd 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.329
 and a 3 i afford the sim card the 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.979
 model in my hand is the 4g model 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.359
 EUR 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:25.830
 the software on memo pad full hd 10 is a 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.009
 android 4.2.2 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.150
 we see here in the 4.2.2 settings that 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.080
 the latest version currently 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.849
 available of android a lot 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.360
 important to resume reiterate how much 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.710
 I have already said availability before 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.580
 access to google play and all 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.699
 its applications 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.530
 after seeing the 4g model we come to the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.750
 wifi model that as we have said has 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.120
 an intel processor differs 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.300
 technically because we do n't have the slot 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.520
 of the micro sim 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.039
 we have the microsd friend's slot 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.759
 to expand the memory and a USB port 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:07.139
 that in addition to allowing connectivity 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.360
 also allows you to output a video in 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.770
 full hd and to charge the phone 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.080
 via port through the connector 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.710
 micro usb this is important for one 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.509
 question of standardization of the gods 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.620
 feeders because otherwise in the house 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.470
 we will meet more and more 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.139
 otherwise he is like his brother 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.830
 4g equipped with rear camera of 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.900
 two stereo speaker power button e 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.930
 volume keys 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.570
 on its right side memo pad full hd 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.590
 10 will arrive on the Italian market in two 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.600
 colors 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.110
 we have a dark blue and 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.110
 a white one 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.860
 we are considering whether to launch white e 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.930
 dark blue in both the wifi and in 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.560
 that 4g or one must differentiate one 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.020
 color for the wifi part and for his 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.659
 part 4 gen 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.669
 however important for those who loved i 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.759
 colors the availability of accessories 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.740
 in fact we will have cases that are 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.569
 available in different models with the 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.759
 only custody we say protects it 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.250
 screen as we see it here in green 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:21.120
 pink and black or a case we say 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.030
 a by way of an envelope where we can put the 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.240
 tablet put it away and take it away maybe the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.030
 envelope is more suited to women the 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.689
 screen cover plus a male use 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:37.949
 in short, without handbags 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:41.459
 asus eee pad full hd 10 will arrive in 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:43.379
 two wifi and 4g versions in the course 

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:45.360
 of the summer presumably in Italy 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.009
 we will see return from vacation 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.779
 what we in the sector call 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.249
 back to school then the return to 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.249
 our children's school
