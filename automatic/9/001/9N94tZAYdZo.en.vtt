00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
inches you'll start by sealing the ends

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
inches you'll start by sealing the ends
of<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.640> ribbon<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> heat<00:00:42.600> source<00:00:42.899> like

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
around the end of the clip so that it

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:13.619 
around the end of the clip so that it
doesn't<00:02:01.370> show<00:02:01.610> any<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.120> metal

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.380 

to<00:02:14.629> make<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.989> bow<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.810> loops<00:02:19.390> these

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
to make the bow I just do loops these

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.759 
to make the bow I just do loops these
are<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.659> first<00:02:20.930> two<00:02:21.260> loops<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.900> cross

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
are the first two loops and then I cross

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.570 
are the first two loops and then I cross
over<00:02:25.099> for<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.849> second<00:02:26.330> two<00:02:26.510> loops<00:02:27.430> sort<00:02:28.430> of

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
over for the second two loops sort of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.680 
over for the second two loops sort of
like<00:02:28.790> an<00:02:28.940> X<00:02:29.269> or<00:02:29.629> a<00:02:29.690> butterfly<00:02:31.329> so<00:02:32.329> it'll<00:02:32.540> look

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
like an X or a butterfly so it'll look

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.710 
like an X or a butterfly so it'll look
like<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:34.340> then<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.640> take<00:02:34.909> my<00:02:34.940> quarter

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
like that and then I take my quarter

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.839 
like that and then I take my quarter
inch<00:02:36.129> for<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.220> center<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.549> tie<00:02:40.819> a

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
inch for the center and you just tie a

00:02:40.849 --> 00:03:06.250 
inch for the center and you just tie a
knot<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:42.140> hold<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.530> together

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.520 

once<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.610> not<00:03:08.050> for<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.170> center

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
once you have the not for the center

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.660 
once you have the not for the center
tide<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.860> hot<00:03:15.860> glue<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.239> end<00:03:17.450> of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
tide you can hot glue it to the end of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:32.160 
tide you can hot glue it to the end of
the<00:03:19.670> barrette

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.040 

and<00:03:32.530> then<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:33.100> full<00:03:33.580> part<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> quarter-inch

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
and then I full part of the quarter-inch

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:45.180 
and then I full part of the quarter-inch
over<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:41.140> then<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.160> trim<00:03:42.459> your<00:03:42.490> ends<00:03:44.190> and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
over and then you trim your ends and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.520 
over and then you trim your ends and
after<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.060> trim<00:03:46.420> off<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.870> ribbon<00:03:47.080> you<00:03:47.260> want

after you trim off the ribbon you want

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.290 
after you trim off the ribbon you want
to<00:03:47.680> make<00:03:47.830> sure<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.250> heat<00:03:48.490> seal<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.180> it

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
to make sure you heat seal it so it

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.560 
to make sure you heat seal it so it
doesn't<00:03:49.690> fray<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.910> our<00:03:51.910> barrette<00:03:52.330> is

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
doesn't fray and our barrette is

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.110 
doesn't fray and our barrette is
