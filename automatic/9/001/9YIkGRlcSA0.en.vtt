generation what we wanted to do with the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.459 
generation what we wanted to do with the
new<00:00:11.639> real<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.030> give<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.660> more<00:00:12.929> right<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.259> need

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
new real is give you more right you need

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.470 
new real is give you more right you need
to<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.710> more<00:00:14.280> options<00:00:14.549> more<00:00:14.790> performance

to have more options more performance

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.840 
to have more options more performance
more<00:00:15.960> technology<00:00:16.619> we've<00:00:17.100> done<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.520> three

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
more technology we've done that in three

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.480 
more technology we've done that in three
unique<00:00:18.359> ways<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.859> our<00:00:20.100> X<00:00:20.250> ship

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
unique ways the first one is our X ship

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.609 
unique ways the first one is our X ship
technology<00:00:21.119> x-shape<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> bearing

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
technology x-shape is a bearing

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.950 
technology x-shape is a bearing
supported<00:00:23.039> pinion<00:00:23.340> gear<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.609> both<00:00:23.880> sides<00:00:24.180> so

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
supported pinion gear on both sides so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.929 
supported pinion gear on both sides so
you<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.439> your<00:00:25.769> basically<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.550> your<00:00:26.670> pinion

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
you have your basically have your pinion

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.439 
you have your basically have your pinion
gear<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.699> normal<00:00:30.029> super<00:00:30.269> free

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
gear and you know from normal super free

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.820 
gear and you know from normal super free
you<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.960> bearing<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.590> side

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you have one bearing on one side

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.950 
you have one bearing on one side
supporting<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.759> pinion<00:00:33.149> gear<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.840> by

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
supporting that that pinion gear but by

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.120 
supporting that that pinion gear but by
putting<00:00:34.110> another<00:00:34.440> bearing<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> other

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
putting another bearing on the other

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.610 
putting another bearing on the other
side<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> becomes<00:00:36.030> stable<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
side now it becomes stable so what that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.049 
side now it becomes stable so what that
does<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.190> you're<00:00:38.340> turning<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> handle

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
does is when you're turning the handle

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
does is when you're turning the handle
burning<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> big<00:00:39.809> crankbait<00:00:40.320> we're<00:00:40.920> catching<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
burning a big crankbait we're catching a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
burning a big crankbait we're catching a
lot<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> fish<00:00:41.640> thrown<00:00:41.850> Alabama<00:00:42.270> Rig<00:00:42.480> whatever

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
lot of fish thrown Alabama Rig whatever

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
lot of fish thrown Alabama Rig whatever
that<00:00:43.320> gear<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.129> tight<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.640> there

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that gear is going to be tight in there

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.650 
that gear is going to be tight in there
so<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> give<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
so it's going to give you a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
so it's going to give you a
longer-lasting<00:00:46.200> gear<00:00:46.920> more<00:00:47.460> torque<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> more

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
longer-lasting gear more torque and more

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
longer-lasting gear more torque and more
power<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.620> next<00:00:49.829> cool<00:00:50.010> feature<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> our

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
power the next cool feature is our

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.610 
power the next cool feature is our
breaking<00:00:51.030> technology<00:00:51.210> which<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> SBS

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
breaking technology which is SBS

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
breaking technology which is SBS
infinity<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.059> came<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
infinity you know we came out with a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
infinity you know we came out with a
variable<00:00:55.140> brake<00:00:55.410> system<00:00:55.829> years<00:00:56.039> ago<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> it's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
variable brake system years ago and it's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.979 
variable brake system years ago and it's
probably<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.969> best<00:00:57.149> braking<00:00:57.510> system<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
probably the best braking system that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.590 
probably the best braking system that
we've<00:00:58.109> ever<00:00:58.230> done<00:00:58.940> what<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.059> wanted<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.480> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we've ever done what we wanted to do is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.240 
we've ever done what we wanted to do is
make<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.410> where<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.710> adjust<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
make it so where you can adjust it on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
make it so where you can adjust it on
the<00:01:02.399> fly<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> side<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the fly so it has here on the side this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.969 
the fly so it has here on the side this
little<00:01:05.070> dial<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.110> what<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.320> does<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
little dial and what this does is it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
little dial and what this does is it
adjust<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.729> cone<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.840> inside<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
adjust a cone on the inside of the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.750 
adjust a cone on the inside of the
school<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> real

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
school here which will make the real

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.340 
school here which will make the real
adjustable<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.509> here's<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.930> centrifugal

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
adjustable so here's your centrifugal

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
adjustable so here's your centrifugal
brakes<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.600> side<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
brakes and then on this side this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
brakes and then on this side this
there's<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:20.340> ring<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.150> when

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there's this little ring here and when

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.260 
there's this little ring here and when
you<00:01:21.360> adjust<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.200> ring<00:01:22.439> goes<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.040> out

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
you adjust it that ring goes in and out

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.380 
you adjust it that ring goes in and out
putting<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.540> or<00:01:24.810> less<00:01:25.049> pressure<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
putting more or less pressure on the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
putting more or less pressure on the
brakes<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.820> you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
brakes so now as you're you know you're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.340 
brakes so now as you're you know you're
burning<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> bank<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:30.840> whatever<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
burning the bank or whatever the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
burning the bank or whatever the
conditions<00:01:31.590> change<00:01:32.250> whatnot<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.720> adjust

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
conditions change whatnot you can adjust

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.789 
conditions change whatnot you can adjust
this<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:35.220> cool<00:01:35.490> SVS<00:01:36.210> infinity<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.560> third

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this so very cool SVS infinity the third

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.850 
this so very cool SVS infinity the third
cool<00:01:38.220> technology<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> RS<00:01:39.360> 3d<00:01:39.900> spool<00:01:40.259> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
cool technology is RS 3d spool it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
cool technology is RS 3d spool it's
basically<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.430> new<00:01:41.630> construction<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.810> we

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
basically a new construction how we

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.510 
basically a new construction how we
manufacture<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> spool<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.220> wanted<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
manufacture the spool what we wanted to
