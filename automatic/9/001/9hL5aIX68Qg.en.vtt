00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.240

 iphone 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.900
 so in fact there is no there is no 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.430
 software there is no connection 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.290
 bluetooth wireless it's really 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.290
 hardware hardware so he's going to touch 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.479
 birth attendants must from the phone you 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.090
 have nothing to install it you launch a 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.370
 game you plug the mobile into 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.670
 powershell you launch a game and then the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.160
 everything to play so we also have a 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.530
 battery that are here in rome to 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.190
 about in the middle we're going to say father 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.340
 lachaise that will allow to lengthen

 your gaming experience just about 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.380
 low dir du double since it is little 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.730
 close what do you have our iphone 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.080
 and that will allow to recharge your 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.790
 mobile at the same time that you are in 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.620
 train to play 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.590
 if you want to recharge in 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.100
 do it by shell or your mobile 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.200
 simply connect in usb 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.209
 in the drunkenness is less necessarily like 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.690
 like c1 like his imports you have 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.220
 found quite frequently 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.320
 it's not hard if you lose am here 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.239
 before and necessarily the house that can 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.830
 do it so we already have a list 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.739
 games that are that are compatible 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.970
 with the controller and we at this list 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.970
 sweat on the website 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.470
 but it's not a is not a list 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.630
 which takes into account absolutely every 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.340
 games that are compatible for now 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:06.540
 it's the games that we tested with 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.430
 exactly Algeria 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.080
 we are really waiting for these 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.750
 markets are growing and already a 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.060
 huge market gaming market gender kind of 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.370
 Thu 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.140
 well I think my part by the fact that 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.989
 ios is allow this connection 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.610
 ardor hardware it means that it 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.110
 means a lot more to fincher 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.480
 available to support him game 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.239
 developers so but who is not he 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.280
 wants they will be able to benefit from the fact 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.750
 that there is a geo in the iphone 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.860
 so for trips like that they 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.690
 will take them into account for the game 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.510
 then touch it stays hot so if 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.560
 you still want to add a layer 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.489
 touch interaction with with the game 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.910
 this way possible 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:55.269
 and in addition we use the controls the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.560
 joystick on some games wii end after 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.900
 the goal was actually to remove 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.329
 oscillate the devices you have 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.290
 on in the game device 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.849
 graphically the game is so in focus 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.709
 there will probably be games that you 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.329
 allow to switch completely on 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.960
 the joystick on the email that having 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:17.400
 the touch is not all but 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:22.980
 majority who are just going to 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.990
 eventually actually the goal it's not 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.070
 dignity to remove the parade 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.530
 on the phone it's really 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.350
 add to add something after 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.730
 it's the game developers who will 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.900
 decide on diamonds by that I'm going 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.210
 take the feature lead because I 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.980
 am interested in that or I do not like 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.960
 not being able to move to have 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.800
 an interaction moving the iphone bones 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.580
 that he will remain stable 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.810
 I will not take into account so this is 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.800
 true that there will have been all that gives 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.140
 a possibility 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.860
 another word game developers we did this 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.420
 produced for the sake of its size 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.800
 because it's something we want 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.530
 to be we want them to be really 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.420
 compact in operating to take anything 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.270
 wherever it can be stored 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.210
 in a small backpack a pocket you 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.300
 can go out at any time 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.220
 it is compatible as soon as possible 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.680
 you do not need to take out its refill 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.700
 batteries at the same time and that's it 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.550
 does not have much that we have not added 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.750
 no more button because the goal was 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.280
 precisely to have to keep this 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.280
 exactly its main for the 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.980
 most of the games that are still who 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.300
 only now begins to 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.640
 benefit from more opportunities 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.670
 interaction with the player 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.150
 and then you also have this accessory 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.340
 which allows you to connect directly 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.260
 to directly connect your help 7 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.150
 finally prevents us from using the case 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.190
 apple provided you with with the iphone 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.330
 then be able to answer a call to 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.130
 middle of your gaming session then 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.199
 yeah everything works as usual 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.760
 never say but that as they 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.550
 do not communicate with us all or with 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.639
 wireless the main one that would be 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.050
 to actually extinguish the sources of whom 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.699
 actually consume the battery that 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.310
 would consume energy on your 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.940
 battery it will be at 99.99 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.750
 it will be it will be available at apple 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.150
 to stroll online it's me during the 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.729
 sold Apple sells directly to its 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:30.300
 site is in its stores and we will have 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:32.550
 also from this month and we will have our 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.820
 breeds and 10-40 fnac and amazon who will have 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.440
 also you succeed then there will be 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.750
 deposits that will be that are planned for 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.330
 Christmas and after we 'll have a 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.550
 much wider availability in 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:49.220
 all the stores and she was then 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.220
 than who usually sell products 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.110
 and
