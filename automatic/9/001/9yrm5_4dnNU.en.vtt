definitely and then we do have the
galaxy<00:00:24.210> s6<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.260> required<00:00:25.769> 0.2<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.769> let's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
galaxy s6 we can required 0.2 and let's

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:41.959 
galaxy s6 we can required 0.2 and let's
start<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:29.730> let's<00:00:30.710> scope<00:00:40.579> galaxy<00:00:41.579> s6<00:00:41.790> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
start up here let's scope galaxy s6 of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:51.260 
start up here let's scope galaxy s6 of
course<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.450> its<00:00:42.890> TouchWiz<00:00:43.890> UI<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> going

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
know you get a lot of devices can keep

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
know you get a lot of devices can keep
track<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.420> both<00:01:33.420> are

rocking pretty good performance of
called<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> galaxy<00:01:37.320> should<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:38.159> good

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
called the galaxy should have good

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.340 
called the galaxy should have good
performance<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.670> new<00:01:41.670> baby

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350

if we go into settings here and let's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.289 
if we go into settings here and let's
just<00:01:53.579> check<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.360> iOS<00:01:54.720> 8.3<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.820> goes<00:01:57.000> about

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
just check out iOS 8.3 and it goes about

bond tool very nice of course you get a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.310 
bond tool very nice of course you get a
bigger<00:02:04.380> display<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.630> which<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.929> nice

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
bigger display here which could be nice

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.050 
bigger display here which could be nice
it<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.830> be<00:02:07.979> nice<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.380> galaxy<00:02:10.739> s6

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
it can be nice on the on the galaxy s6

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.009 
it can be nice on the on the galaxy s6
let's<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> lock<00:02:12.660> screen<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.989> I

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
let's see here the lock screen but I

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.780 
let's see here the lock screen but I
mean<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.470> compact<00:02:16.920> display<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.670> do

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
mean that compact display that you do

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.410 
mean that compact display that you do
get<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.900> iPhone<00:02:19.650> 5s<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.880> nice

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
get on the iPhone 5s this is so nice

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.440 
get on the iPhone 5s this is so nice
that's<00:02:21.750> why<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:21.989> said<00:02:22.470> there<00:02:22.650> no<00:02:22.920> earlier<00:02:23.450> use

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that's why I said there no earlier use

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.080 
that's why I said there no earlier use
it<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.380> mp3<00:02:26.780> player<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:28.620> Spotify<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it as a mp3 player with Spotify it is a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.470 
it as a mp3 player with Spotify it is a
little<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.540> thicker<00:02:31.430> definitely<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.180> they

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
little bit thicker definitely but they

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.900 
little bit thicker definitely but they
it<00:02:33.750> also<00:02:33.870> comes<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.799> them<00:02:35.160> touch<00:02:35.640> ID

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
it also comes with this them touch ID

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.780 
it also comes with this them touch ID
sensor<00:02:36.140> same<00:02:37.140> as<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.440> galaxy<00:02:37.890> s6<00:02:38.160> has<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.459> new

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
sensor same as the galaxy s6 has a new

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.330 
sensor same as the galaxy s6 has a new
fingerprint<00:02:39.690> sensors<00:02:40.140> use<00:02:40.410> hold<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.220> can

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
fingerprint sensors use hold in you can

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.699 
fingerprint sensors use hold in you can
hold<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.790> both<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.450> unlock<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> device<00:02:42.959> so

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
hold it on both to unlock the device so

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.890 
hold it on both to unlock the device so
both<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.340> very<00:02:44.700> very<00:02:45.380> good<00:02:46.380> devices<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.900> 2015

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
both are very very good devices for 2015
