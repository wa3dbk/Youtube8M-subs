00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.320
 small poster with the inscription 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.510

 to fight crime and how me 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.930
 it seems it is a direct reference to 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.520
 long awaited civil war during 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.460

 times my client robson energy is mentioned 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.920
 corporation so this company 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.900
 has a very weighty position in 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.210
 marvel universe is a cerebral 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.490

 with a sniper rifle an order to open 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.860
 fire to kill and what is there especially 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.690
 interesting is that when 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.100
 the killer gets his rifle out of the bag 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.680
