00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.490
 the desire to get more raccoon is inherent 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.349
 perhaps every beekeeper many are ready 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 wander for buckwheat for this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.670
 sunflowers 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.400
 some canola other honey plants 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 inconvenience is more than offset by 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.470
 that the bees quickly fill and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.750
 seals the frame and that's when the bill 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.550
 starts to go no longer on the frame she 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.590
 shells 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.649
 the problem arises as quickly 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 pump out the world in our practice too 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.180
 there have been such good years 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 that from the abundance of honey and the amount of work on 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.700
 his rollout came something like 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.920
 confusion bottleneck 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.629
 printing out honeycombs on the wandering accounts 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 rely only on their own hands 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.559
 the easiest tool to pump honey 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 in the field 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.520
 yes even while he puts warm near u 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.440
 her tent 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 set in it a honey extractor and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.870
 are armed with a special plug for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 opening combs or special knife but also 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.510
 Further not everything is as simple as it seems mid 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 liquid specific properties 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.479
 it simultaneously sticks and sticks 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.150
 sprawls usually print 100 on 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.430
 tables over a wide bowl abuts 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.220
 side frame frame in an empty case 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.850
 where is the container or use 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.590
 other stops but in the end clothes 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.990
 equipment is inevitably smeared in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.439
 flowing honey stick around and lid a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 work is still moving slowly 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.450
 honey extractor stands idle when faced 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 with the prospect of a similar situation we 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.670
 found a way out in the equipment kind 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.189
 dismountable conveyor line 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.000
 stolen became the simplest designs 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.130
 we had several helpers question 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 stood in how to create them so 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.939
 comfortable working environment 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 to honey extractor 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.369
 did not stand idle on equipment 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.909
 this kind of conveyor should not 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.759
 it was take more than one day invented 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.920
 us and so even assembled design 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.530
 has a number of distinctive features 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.900
 the most important materials for which we 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.000
 patenting therefore instead of shooting we give 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.090
 so far only the drawing on which these 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.260
 distinctive details not shown 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.530
 collapsible design consists of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.989
 tubular struts one transverse 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.950
 two metal connecting tubes 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.560
 corners 3 and trays 4 of thin sheet 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.170
 food life in the kit is optional 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.360
 enters capacity for collecting flowing honey 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.819
 and lumber produced during 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.380
 printing combs 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.050
 the essence of the product in considered here 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.959
 picking is that on the corners 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.630
 put the case with sealed frames a 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.380
 around the table are jobs 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.239
 by the number of assistants involved 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.170
 work on such a small area 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.630
 mechanization 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.780
 argue because everyone has access 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.459
 to the framework nobody interferes with anyone and everyone 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.060
 that flows down from any frame not 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.590
 smeared and falls into total capacity 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.959
 aside from the obvious constructive 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.940
 Product merits 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.880
 plays and manufacturability it 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.540
 making everything done literally for 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.090
 day shop we cut off the length of two 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.690
 corner and 6 tubes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.230
 in the same place on the benders of the last 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 bent at a right angle in another department 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.790
 we took two sheets estimate picked up 16 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.880
 bolts 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.120
 8 of them with hidden heads and so much 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.220
 the lamb to the typical construction of a 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.530
 because cheap planed boards 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.380
 the staff cut us lengths 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.750
 the width of the future was all this 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.120
 brought home 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.340
 with a hand drill drilled into the corner and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.340
 tubing holes for mounting the frame 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.560
 became the only size that is necessary 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.709
 maintain this distance between 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.019
 vertical sticks of corners it should 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.380
 be 5 millimeters longer than y 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.200
 left hull corners sheet done 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.420
 mounting holes 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.970
 daughters laid out the sides of each 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.609
 a friend put on them two pieces 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.980
 tight braid and profit in such 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.680
 position studs with wide caps 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.770
 on honey plants we transport the table disassembled 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.650
 form the corners and put the trays separately 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.190
 dots covers collapse not big 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.950
 drum 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.460
 it all fits easily in the trunk or 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.410
 in the back seat of a car 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.780
 on arrival at honey plants for five 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.780
 minutes and without any tools 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.680
 thanks to hook powders we collect everything 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.730
 accessories 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.980
 about the exception will protect the tent right 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.940
 Between the guide angles set 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.040
 in the middle of the body with a frame for pumping 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.520
 4 workplaces on the sides allow 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.560
 open at the same time 4 frames honey and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.840
 the lids of the tents flow into 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.800
 substituted capacity all clean 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.820
 neatly 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.980
 convenient to fill the 20 frame 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.270
 honey extractor to each member of this 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.200
 a kind of brigade 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.790
 need to print a total of five frames 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.860
 repeat this operation while there are frames 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.900
 to pump 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.350
 finished work remove and wash 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.900
 trays 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.570
 and on the shelf corner roll out 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.630
 matched boards 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.670
 down we get a comfortable working and 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.660
 dining table which is nice 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.630
 Mark 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.490
 shock held and so 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.660
 productive day to the next morning 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.510
 stay fit 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.360
 use the table and as a kind of sports 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.900
 bars pushups and exercises for 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.560
 press 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.560
 do on them with a couple of simple 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.560
 baits
