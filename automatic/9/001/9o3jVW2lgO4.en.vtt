I<00:00:32.099> believe<00:00:32.669> concept<00:00:33.360> horn<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.410> good

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
I believe concept horn is in very good

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
I believe concept horn is in very good
condition<00:00:35.000> now<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.840> cornet<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
condition now this is a cornet so it is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
condition now this is a cornet so it is
the<00:00:39.210> long<00:00:39.450> cornet<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.320> call<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.890> what

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the long cornet as they call it but what

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160 
the long cornet as they call it but what
makes<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.489> horn<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.180> unique<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> couple<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
makes this horn so unique is a couple of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.959 
makes this horn so unique is a couple of
different<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.469> firstly<00:00:44.430> you've<00:00:44.700> got<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
different things firstly you've got a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.049 
different things firstly you've got a
very<00:00:45.390> large<00:00:45.600> bell<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.550> actually<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
very large bell here it's actually a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
very large bell here it's actually a
little<00:00:48.329> better<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.870> five<00:00:49.170> inches<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.680> think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
little better than five inches I think

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.180 
little better than five inches I think
it's<00:00:50.070> five<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.910> eighth<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.890> course

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it's five and an eighth and of course

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
it's five and an eighth and of course
then<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.989> cornet<00:00:54.989> which<00:00:55.230> generally

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
then you have the cornet which generally

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.569 
then you have the cornet which generally
has<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> smaller<00:00:58.160> receiver<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
has a smaller receiver and then it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.689 
has a smaller receiver and then it
begins<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> move<00:01:00.899> larger<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> neat<00:01:02.670> thing

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
begins to move larger but the neat thing

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.109 
begins to move larger but the neat thing
with<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> horn<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.379> its<00:01:05.119> usual

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
with this horn is with its usual

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
with this horn is with its usual
receiver<00:01:06.930> size<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> cornet<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.310> easy

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
receiver size for a cornet very easy

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.230 
receiver size for a cornet very easy
blow<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> bell<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.189> gets<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.909> big

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
blow but with the bell it gets a big

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
blow but with the bell it gets a big
sound<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.369> really<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.840> played<00:01:16.140> very

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sound and really it can be played very

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.550 
sound and really it can be played very
much<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> trumpet<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
much like a trumpet but you have that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.609 
much like a trumpet but you have that
option<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.840> cornet<00:01:21.840> versatility<00:01:22.590> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
option with the cornet versatility you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.660 
option with the cornet versatility you
can<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> very<00:01:23.400> nice<00:01:23.880> deep<00:01:24.720> dark<00:01:25.170> sound<00:01:25.670> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
can get a very nice deep dark sound this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.010 
can get a very nice deep dark sound this
is<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.350> essentially<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> Marcinko<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
is with essentially it's a Marcinko it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
is with essentially it's a Marcinko it's
1.75<00:01:31.020> shoe<00:01:31.380> made<00:01:31.680> by<00:01:31.710> constable<00:01:32.400> but

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
1.75 shoe made by constable but

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
1.75 shoe made by constable but
relatively<00:01:33.299> shallow<00:01:33.659> mouthpiece<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.920> helps

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
relatively shallow mouthpiece just helps

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
relatively shallow mouthpiece just helps
you<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.340> around<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> horn<00:01:36.060> real<00:01:36.299> easy<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you get around on the horn real easy and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.749 
you get around on the horn real easy and
I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.740> much<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.729> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
I think this is pretty much what I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.580 
I think this is pretty much what I
consider<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> sound<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.900> would<00:01:40.049> blend<00:01:40.320> with

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
consider a sound that would blend with

00:01:40.590 --> 00:02:12.260 
consider a sound that would blend with
the<00:01:40.770> trumpet<00:01:41.159> pretty<00:01:41.369> well

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.440 

ah<00:02:13.310> relatively<00:02:14.310> shallow<00:02:14.580> mouthpiece<00:02:15.210> that's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
ah relatively shallow mouthpiece that's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.760 
ah relatively shallow mouthpiece that's
what<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> use<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:15.870> my<00:02:16.080> trip<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.590> usually

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
what I use on my trip it's usually

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.460 
what I use on my trip it's usually
unlike<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> little<00:02:17.550> bit<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.730> cup<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.870> when<00:02:19.260> we

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
unlike a little bit of cup but when we

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.310 
unlike a little bit of cup but when we
use<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.460> deeper<00:02:21.080> mouthpiece

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
use a deeper mouthpiece

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.420 
use a deeper mouthpiece
I<00:02:22.350> think<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.370> horn<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.440> kind<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
I think this horn just this kind of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.370 
I think this horn just this kind of
model<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.300> constellation<00:02:27.840> like

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
model and there is a constellation like

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.560 
model and there is a constellation like
this<00:02:28.850> very<00:02:29.850> much

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this very much

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.470 
this very much
mouthpiece<00:02:31.730> sensitive<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.270> get<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
mouthpiece sensitive so you do get a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.040 
mouthpiece sensitive so you do get a
really<00:02:34.170> good<00:02:34.560> deep<00:02:35.130> warm<00:02:35.700> sound<00:02:36.180> when<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.900> go

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
really good deep warm sound when you go

00:02:37.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
really good deep warm sound when you go
to<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.200> deeper<00:02:37.650> cupped<00:02:37.890> mouthpiece

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:23.720 

so<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.190> leave<00:03:11.370> cup

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.059 

and<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.939> course<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:26.200> shallower<00:03:26.620> Acuff<00:03:26.920> as

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
and of course the shallower Acuff as

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:44.090 
and of course the shallower Acuff as
well

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.240 

again<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.460> con<00:03:46.740> six<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:49.230> 1956<00:03:50.250> simply

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
again that is the con six a 1956 simply
