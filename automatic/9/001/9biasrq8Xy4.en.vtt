00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.580
 and you the random hue that you are seeing 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.230
 this video what would you say if I told you that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.230
 it can be a big part of youtube 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.760
 so let me tell you one thing, no 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.530
 but good if you want to skip the part 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.870
 of grant and replace it with another 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.119
 adjective then yes it is possible 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.200
 become that thing although you can 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.420
 that affects the little intellect that you have 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.640
 but if you follow these steps at the foot of the 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.260
 letter is almost certain that you will become 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.260
 in a juicy and well sucked 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.500
 better let's go to the 5 steps of the partner 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.500
 regular 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.990
 first they will need a guy 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.420
 anyone to be a partner 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.310
 by anybody I mean a 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.530
 huevÃ³n that lacks own life of 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.380
 talent and if possible not smell 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.660
 all right 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.480
 all that is needed is for it to be a 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.610
 weon ugly and that exists but good for 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.290
 the latter there can be exceptions like 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 the case of certain what in dera that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
 never existed since it was a 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.990
 lazy with a lot of free time that only 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.510
 I wanted to get the attention of another 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.260
 user I will not say names for 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.260
 protect the innocent 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.110
 and if they did not understand this part then 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 let me explain to you with a few 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.440
 examples I can be a partner being a 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.540
 addicted to sugar 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.610
 I can be a partner despite being a 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.860
 junkie 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.130
 I can be a partner even if I do not feel like it 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.259
 to be 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.250
 I can be a partner despite being 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.250
 black no 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.170
 ok we'll let you be a partner but you will not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.170
 start crying like a little girl 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.520
 second they will need a company 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.600
 hungry for money that grants 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600
 partners right and left 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.749
 one 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.730
 can you make me partenaire 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.489
 no problem 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.409
 Third, believe yourself special and superior to 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.629
 despite not having talent or even 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.629
 experience like other major partners 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.670
 it only comes to leave some notices 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.510
 from now on I am a partenaire of the bunch 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.640
 so now I am superior to all 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.260
 you and must consider me a god to 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 despite not having even a thousand 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.549
 subscribers so now I 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.290
 I will concentrate on making shit videos for 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.290
 overcome that bear that everyone loves 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.820
 and of course presume with the excuse of 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.330
 that they are paying me for making videos and 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.530
 tell me how much you earn per month 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.530
 50 cents 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.340
 Step number 4 Take coca cola fuck no 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.990
 question this step just follow it and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.660
 good things will happen 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.000
 and finally realize that despite 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.980
 all the trinkets is still the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.160
 same lion with little talent that always 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.400
 You were fuck I can not become a 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.620
 overrated partner 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.689
 the part of me no avail us nothing 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.079
 and now the other weones who do 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.079
 cyber bullying 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.550
 but good now that I realized 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.000
 this is nothing more than to close my 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.000
 account 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.240
 I think we crushed something you should stop 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.520
 and review you just shut up and follow 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.240
 throwing rainbow we arrived late 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.240
 to go to jupiter 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.770
 i 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.650
 so how do you say it's the process 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.540
 to become a partner you alone 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.900
 stay still that I will take care of 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.900
 all
