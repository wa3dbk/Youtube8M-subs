00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
that's kind of a job the reward is still

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.130 
that's kind of a job the reward is still
having<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.780> world<00:03:05.069> which<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.099> it's<00:03:06.549> nice<00:03:07.140> you

having the world which is it's nice you
may<00:03:08.290> not<00:03:08.409> think<00:03:08.470> about<00:03:08.830> how<00:03:09.220> how<00:03:09.879> nice<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.299> is

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
may not think about how how nice it is

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.619 
may not think about how how nice it is
to<00:03:10.450> still<00:03:10.870> have<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.290> world<00:03:12.420> rapid<00:03:13.420> well<00:03:13.599> I

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
to still have the world rapid well I

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.839 
to still have the world rapid well I
just<00:03:13.930> ruined<00:03:14.200> my<00:03:14.230> perfect<00:03:17.489> figure<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.730> way

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
just ruined my perfect figure out a way

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.140 
just ruined my perfect figure out a way
to<00:03:18.910> get<00:03:19.120> all<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.540> way<00:03:19.629> over<00:03:19.660> there<00:03:19.900> now<00:03:24.150> yeah

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
to get all the way over there now yeah

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.289 
to get all the way over there now yeah
oh<00:03:25.420> yes<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:27.250> could<00:03:27.549> have<00:03:27.700> gone<00:03:27.730> quite<00:03:28.269> badly

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
oh yes that could have gone quite badly

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.020 
oh yes that could have gone quite badly
but<00:03:29.049> I<00:03:29.500> think<00:03:31.140> sometimes<00:03:32.640> when<00:03:33.640> somebody

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
but I think sometimes when somebody

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.479 
but I think sometimes when somebody
screws<00:03:34.329> up<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.750> end<00:03:34.930> up<00:03:35.079> more<00:03:35.530> satisfied<00:03:36.310> with

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
screws up you end up more satisfied with

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.599 
screws up you end up more satisfied with
the<00:03:36.609> outcome<00:03:36.640> because<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.569> was<00:03:37.690> harder<00:03:38.609> and

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
the outcome because it was harder and

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.240 
the outcome because it was harder and
you<00:03:40.060> had<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.390> adapt<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.989> have<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.200> improv<00:03:41.709> roll

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
you had to adapt you have to improv roll

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.680 
you had to adapt you have to improv roll
with<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.549> situation<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:43.810> an<00:03:45.690> and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
with the situation that is that an and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.210 
with the situation that is that an and
that's<00:03:46.870> exactly<00:03:47.019> what<00:03:47.379> I<00:03:47.410> did<00:03:47.500> I'm<00:03:47.859> gonna<00:03:48.010> lose

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
that's exactly what I did I'm gonna lose

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.740 
that's exactly what I did I'm gonna lose
all<00:03:48.400> these<00:03:48.609> rings<00:03:48.879> here<00:03:49.180> but<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.420> don't<00:03:49.629> think

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
all these rings here but I don't think

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.479 
all these rings here but I don't think
it<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:49.930> matters<00:03:50.170> I'm<00:03:50.859> count<00:03:51.129> i<00:03:51.280> already

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
it really matters I'm count i already

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.309 
it really matters I'm count i already
got<00:03:51.609> an<00:03:51.760> extra<00:03:52.060> life<00:03:52.239> from<00:03:52.450> him<00:03:52.629> i<00:03:54.959> did<00:03:55.959> not<00:03:56.049> do

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
got an extra life from him i did not do

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:09.420 
got an extra life from him i did not do
that<00:03:56.470> on<00:03:56.650> purpose<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:58.000> was<00:03:58.239> stupid

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:18.330 

there<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:11.000> there's<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.720> monitor<00:04:12.170> here<00:04:12.410> I

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.409 

guess<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.489> doesn't<00:04:19.639> matter<00:04:19.790> if<00:04:20.090> you're<00:04:20.180> about

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
guess it doesn't matter if you're about

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.400 
guess it doesn't matter if you're about
to<00:04:20.630> die<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:21.280> suffocation<00:04:22.280> due<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.450> drowning

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410
