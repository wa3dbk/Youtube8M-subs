00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
only issue that I have with them is that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
only issue that I have with them is that
they're<00:00:50.940> coming<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.480> hidden<00:00:51.690> Junction

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and it common sense says just have a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
and it common sense says just have a
little<00:00:57.840> look<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.500> give<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> peek<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.670> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
little look just give it a peek just in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.619

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the common since I should have used was

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.630 
the common since I should have used was
hmm<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.290> should<00:02:47.650> slow<00:02:47.830> down<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.070> lot<00:02:48.400> more

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
hmm I should slow down a lot more

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.280 
hmm I should slow down a lot more

there<00:02:50.650> that's<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.490> I<00:02:51.520> should<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.790> been

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
there that's what I should have been

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.280 
there that's what I should have been
thinking<00:02:52.270> whereas<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.510> was<00:02:52.660> thinking<00:02:52.990> there's
