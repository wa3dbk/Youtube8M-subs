00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.299
 good night my name is mario personal me 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
 call me pee and I'm here today to 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.490
 talk a little about conditioning 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.929
 to clear some doubts and some staff 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.259
 talk how the system works strip 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.930
 some doubts about myths are in the 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.610
 from this period we will try to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.849
 on this subject air conditioning 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.849
 automotive 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.400
 Today we are going to tell you how it works. 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.410
 It is the air conditioning cycle circuit 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.590
 steam or also called air cycle 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.420
 conditioned car he NonÃ´ this system and 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.739
 was thought it was designed over 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.989
 200 years ago 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.250
 it is composed basically of four 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.220
 components that make the equipment that 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.360
 removes heat from an environment and transports 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.720
 to another environment 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.780
 in our case in the automotive line this 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.180
 equipment it will be used 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.730
 to remove heat from the inside 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.900
 the passenger compartment car and transfer this 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.850
 heat for the street 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.550
 then that term that we use so 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.710
 the air conditioning does not freeze clear this is 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.990
 very popular is very 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 So let's say it's a term that does not 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.720
 it was wrong the easiest of us 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.240
 to understand that air conditioning 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.950
 environment and transports it to the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 other then it is a machine or equipment 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.960
 to carry heat 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.560
 in the automotive air conditioning system 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 steam cycle 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.250
 we have four basic components 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.590
 any air conditioning system 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.150
 reason they will have their four pieces 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.170
 if you open the hood of a car from a 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.690
 tractor of an airplane a single engine motor bi 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.660
 propeller right you will find these 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:55.580
 components here will start with the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.860
 Compressor have various shapes 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.680
 but his main function 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.960
 is to turn the rotary 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.890
 pressure and temperature in the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.510
 refrigerant it converts energy and 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.820
 transforms print and 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.580
 temperature for the refrigerant fluid 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.000
 after the compressor the fluid 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.050
 coolant comes out of the compressor in 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.900
 of hot steam and goes to the condenser 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.060
 this is one of the most important pieces of 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.520
 mainly on the agricultural line 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.680
 and off-road vehicles 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.510
 dirt can damage the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.970
 here in the beginning the pain will occur 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.690
 the process of condensation which is 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.630
 condensation and the transformation of the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.690
 Here liquid refrigerant is 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.690
 turn it out a hot fluid from the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.830
 compressor thus turns a liquid 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.600
 warm in the beginning the pain after that 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.080
 component it goes into the filter 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.850
 dryer than an accessory and after the end 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.590
 the dryer it goes to the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.940
 expansion that is one of the secrets of 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.590
 air conditioning system 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.110
 A lot of people do not understand how 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 coolant cooler works 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.799
 here in the expansion valve in the state of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.090
 warm liquid under pressure passes through a 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.750
 orifice a restriction an obstruction and 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.720
 soon after he loses pressure after 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.450
 overcome this obstacle if resistance it 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.090
 loses pressure when it loses pressure and 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.110
 also loses temperature and it gets 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.750
 fit 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.970
 to go through the fourth component 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.400
 evaporator or refrigerant 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.740
 exited the expansion valve with a 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.540
 very low temperature about zero 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.210
 degree 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.080
 it enters the steam into the pain and this fluid 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.200
 refrigerant that is very cold receives 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.690
 warm air warm air from inside the car 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.710
 an area at a temperature of 20 and 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.080
 30 degrees 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.180
 and this heat causes the fluid 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.040
 refrigerant that is inside of vapor to 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.470
 pain absorbs this heat and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.930
 liquid in vapor 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.780
 the refrigerant fluid becomes 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.380
 new here on the delicate evaporator of the cold 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.140
 for cold steam and this cold steam 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.870
 returns to the compressor 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:31.010
 are four steps that fluid 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.010
 soda has to pass through
