00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello everyone today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.390
 traditional dessert rice pudding 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:16.950
 for that we put a pot on the fire 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:22.110
 we put it to the maximum and we throw the rice 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.520
 a cup of rice then we add water 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.050
 let her stay 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:32.050
 covered the rice look 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.079
 all the rice is covered by the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.000
 water and then now when we have the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.980
 rice covered by water is the time 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.880
 to add the four cups 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.880
 of milk 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.530
 use the same measure that you have used 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.600
 with the cup 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.780
 two 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 3 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.180
 and 4 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.820
 If you want, you can take a little more 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.829
 milk and dispense the amount of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.549
 Water 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.409
 As we like it, we add the crust 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.679
 of lemon 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.530
 the cinnamon branch and we wait a little bit 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.260
 to throw the sugar 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.460
 because when we throw out the sugar 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.460
 we will not remove 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.729
 and after taking sugar not 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.830
 I'll pass you because if it's too soft, 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.020
 rice as we will then have 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.970
 cooling off is to finish 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.030
 do a little bit then it's okay to 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.600
 the accusers nothing does not reach five 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.670
 minutes the time to prepare them the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.670
 vols and take out the cinnamon 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.990
 We put 3 tablespoons of each 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.120
 if you want that you stay 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.040
 less liquid you can do without 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.200
 directly 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.960
 of the water that we have used to cover 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.750
 the rice anyway now while 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.750
 it cools down also thickens more 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.440
 this is a traditional recipe that 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.440
 do in a moment and you have a dessert 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 ricky yes I like cinnamon 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.620
 I have removed it if you want to serve them more 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.450
 easy you can remove the cinnamon stick and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.660
 the lemon and you are going to go watching the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.660
 cooking pot 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.360
 has been a little bit in the pot so 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.770
 we distribute 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.200
 and now you can 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:02.350
 do several things or well 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:06.260
 let it sit or you can 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.700
 throw the cinnamon 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.620
 on top you can leave one without cinnamon 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.030
 because someone who does not like it and another 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.489
 that this is for me with the branch of 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.439
 whole cinnamon if you want the rice with 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.569
 milk you can do it with the casing of 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.099
 an orange instead of the lemon 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.129
 and so you have a rice pudding 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.840
 different in nothing friends so easy and 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.840
 so rich until next time
