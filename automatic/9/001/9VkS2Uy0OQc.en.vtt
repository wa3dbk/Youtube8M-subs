 channel is inscribed in beauty talking about it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.520
 before the video because this is a video one 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.000
 little different as you saw in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:34.670
 video title I do not know but I found it 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:37.440
 that I did I told the guys that I was going to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 Telling tales of terror I ended up 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.180
 passing chance to relate with 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.420
 If it is happening, it must be something. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.579
 somber game so I thought he 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 It's very interesting, I think. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.500
 both no longer remember you not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.809
 know and I would call I think you 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 They'll like it if you like it so this one here. 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.789
 is the first part and will soon be coming to 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.129
 part 2 is it there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.420
 now turn vignette and said, stay with me 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.890
 flu serious stuff if you dont if you 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.990
 stop playing the sims the fault is not 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.990
 Mine is only then told the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.459
 My name is Jessica, 20 years old. 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.740
 I was addicted to the sims but there was something 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.299
 that I liked messines more was to see the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 accidents happen 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.649
 I never thought if I would move away from 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.329
 somehow but did not affect and much more 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.950
 I'll tell you a story. 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.810
 when I was 11 my cousin came 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 live with us because something happened. 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.880
 unusual with his family his brother and 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.530
 parents died from unnatural causes 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.939
 police when investigating the case 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.729
 classic before mexico 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.860
 but the strangest is how can everyone 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.780
 died for the same reason 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.390
 I have when I get home I had 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 his clothes and a secret of sines that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 left within a deed he did not 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 was found today 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.150
 he just said that he was the only one his game 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.540
 favorite looked into his eyes the emptiness 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.160
 I did not look anything human but I still 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.170
 I do not think he's a bad person 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.269
 Something tells me they just wanted to be 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.000
 saved something very bad and torment 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.870
 always reap an hour on it's up 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.910
 his 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.430
 two years passed and he was still 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.200
 a very private person tried 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.470
 I was trying to talk to him but he just 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.569
 spoke shout do a favor repair 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 This happened every time I played 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.139
 matter about the parents he and his brother I 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.299
 I'm the love changed 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.519
 it was not even close to one of more connected 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.919
 once and for all a friend and I 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.450
 We were talking about games she 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.250
 commented on the islands 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.829
 that typical little girl game you 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.530
 get your house from the garden and the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.599
 characters and I've always been in love 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.859
 for things primarily with rights 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.090
 and the characters with my 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.440
 features 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.480
 When I woke up the next day, my 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.970
 first in my room and asked in 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.560
 jec wants to play this from my friend to whom 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.269
 pressing and then it was a chance of 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.560
 know a little more about it and know the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.239
 what happened 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.130
 we sat on the computer he taught me 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.750
 how are you doing the characters there? 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.120
 I know when I clicked a game to 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.639
 to open a small boring 2 thousand boxes of 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.870
 sound and I did not pay attention at the time 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.760
 maybe it could be a job 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.680
 important that should have touched me 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.630
 before starting to light the wick of the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.880
 my addiction starts here in my family 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.979
 Of course added my cousin and if wanted 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.260
 his tap that he always closed never 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.180
 wanted to interact 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.489
 whenever we put it inside a 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.069
 family plan like trips to the park 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.569
 or even go out for ice cream 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.150
 he said he did not feel like leaving 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.739
 as if feeling guilty 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.420
 of something 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.370
 When we started playing he told me 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.920
 not knowing how to buy and even about 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.599
 money codes would be very good in 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.390
 real life looks like a box from 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.640
 with applause and was in our 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.420
 bank accounts to explode and from 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.980
 money 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.390
 Another thing that worries me was 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.670
 that my cousin when he saw me playing 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.069
 I always spoke to put him to 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.109
 make the food and always keep others 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.049
 family members away I attended the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.539
 his request whenever he played the game. 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.000
 boring if repeated it seemed more like a voice 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.639
 even as if you were saying stay 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.289
 far from each other more seemed taller 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.690
 and sometimes and avoid playing because they do not 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.479
 I wanted it closed and when in the house and every 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.280
 rather a chill down my spine up 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.139
 friend clare at home gained three pounds 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.419
 directly in her as a family member 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.490
 but I considered as a sister and as 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.139
 I knew her a long time, I always knew 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.970
 that she was not a good cook soon 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.639
 placed any type of unit 10 to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.860
 her while creating her character 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.380
 Staff talking while spring kitchen 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.270
 always laughed about it leads to 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.340
 since when she has managed to 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.900
 a dish cloth like legacy an oven 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.750
 I even made a joke that it was 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.340
 I wish I had not done these were a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.770
 of the last words 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.470
 One day you'll end up setting fire to the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.729
 cooks just like I did not want to 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.440
 said none of this 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.570
 both have passed me my cousin 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.970
 I told him more about the game but he always 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.919
 repeat the same things when you start 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.680
 to play 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.650
 people care dies what you mean 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.150
 with this sim is a simulation is common in 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.520
 dying character games 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.370
 It was true that he knew how this 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.979
 death deal and in new game a house 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.620
 new in a new boy character from 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.900
 The school he needed lives in the port. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.870
 not even put up the name of this 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.810
 line 'let's say I've shown a lot 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.000
 for a while he would take baths and 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.010
 even left my bathroom 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.510
 a few days later it came sometimes 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.639
 in schools and within more or 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.229
 even starving he said that 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.740
 He never cooked because his mother did not 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.930
 left to the ground 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.300
 to get home and I decided to 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.099
 game and almost a test of purpose I 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.680
 I put it in the kitchen to make the building worse. 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.990
 eating and went straight through the voice and it's a blink 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.669
 the eyes of fire were on fire, and the 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.919
 fire spread very fast I saw 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.690
 Dying for the moment, I was desperate. 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.449
 I did not know what to do but I spoke to myself. 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.599
 even and only a game is not real and 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.370
 It's ridiculous to be worried when 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.270
 Suddenly death appeared to lead to 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.819
 his weapon 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.389
 she did not like at all games and I go 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.030
 though 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.979
 took and went away she stayed close by 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.190
 five minutes when he looked at the 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.740
 clock and five others were 10 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.110
 he only with the ball stopped when I 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.930
 I started when I thought I 'd close the game. 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.720
 key in my sound box came back and co 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.830
 something like you should not have played 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.960
 thereby 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.580
 and suddenly the cry of pain my cousin 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.000
 He listened as he entered the room and looked 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.849
 coldly told you did not come and go 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.960
 your eyes I know if you just 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:57.960
 enter a path with no return 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.960
 to be continued
