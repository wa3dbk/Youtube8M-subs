be talking to you guys about a new curve

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.520 
be talking to you guys about a new curve
that's<00:00:36.540> actually<00:00:36.870> been<00:00:36.989> released<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that's actually been released and this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
that's actually been released and this
is<00:00:37.649> actually<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.460> follow-up<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> previous

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
is actually a follow-up to the previous

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
is actually a follow-up to the previous
curve<00:00:40.379> curve<00:00:41.190> sorry<00:00:42.410> which<00:00:43.610> was<00:00:44.610> previously

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
curve curve sorry which was previously

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
curve curve sorry which was previously
old<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.750> eight<00:00:45.930> five<00:00:46.200> two<00:00:46.230> zero<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.890> eight

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
old the eight five two zero and eight

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.660 
old the eight five two zero and eight
five<00:00:47.370> three<00:00:47.789> zero<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.829> we've

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
five three zero and then now we've

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.369 
five three zero and then now we've
actually<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> nine<00:00:51.840> three<00:00:52.170> two<00:00:52.350> zero

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
actually got to the nine three two zero

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.330 
actually got to the nine three two zero
so<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> probably<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> low-end

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
so this is probably one of the low-end

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
so this is probably one of the low-end
blackberry<00:00:56.340> curves<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:57.030> BlackBerry's<00:00:57.629> in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
blackberry curves or BlackBerry's in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.000 
blackberry curves or BlackBerry's in
general<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.280> is<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.870> 3G<00:01:01.350> phone<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
general and this one is a 3G phone and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.490 
general and this one is a 3G phone and
it<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.480> released<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.290> May

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it was just released actually in May

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
it was just released actually in May
2012<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:07.310> resolution<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.670> 320<00:01:09.000> by

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
2012 this one has a resolution of 320 by

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.580 
2012 this one has a resolution of 320 by
240<00:01:09.720> pixels<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> pixel<00:01:11.820> density<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
240 pixels and has a pixel density of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.340 
240 pixels and has a pixel density of
164<00:01:13.590> PPI<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.760> obviously<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.780> much<00:01:16.049> as

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
164 PPI so obviously it's not as much as

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.620 
164 PPI so obviously it's not as much as
the<00:01:16.710> blackberry<00:01:17.159> 9900<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the blackberry 9900 which is I think the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.480 
the blackberry 9900 which is I think the
top<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> range<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> moment<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.280> terms

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
top of the range at the moment in terms

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.690 
top of the range at the moment in terms
of<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.850> blackberry<00:01:21.600> hardware<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.140> software

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
of a blackberry hardware and software

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
of a blackberry hardware and software
etc<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.000> terms<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> Ramakant<00:01:25.380> 512

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
megabytes of ram internal memory there's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
megabytes of ram internal memory there's
nothing<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:32.450> however<00:01:33.450> does

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
nothing as as of right now however does

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.399 
nothing as as of right now however does
support<00:01:34.700> microSD<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.210> 32<00:01:36.780> gigabytes<00:01:37.020> which

support microSD up to 32 gigabytes which

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.690 
support microSD up to 32 gigabytes which
is<00:01:37.560> obviously<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> case<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.490> most

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is obviously the case with most

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
actually realized is that it actually is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.679 
actually realized is that it actually is
now<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.729> shipping<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.240> BlackBerry
