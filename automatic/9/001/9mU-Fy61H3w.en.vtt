going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> show<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> difference<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
going to show you the difference it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.479 
going to show you the difference it

onto your computer that huge difference

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.810 
onto your computer that huge difference
it<00:01:04.199> makes<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> amount<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> resources<00:01:05.339> uses

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it makes the amount of resources uses

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310 
it makes the amount of resources uses
for<00:01:05.939> your<00:01:06.030> machine<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:06.750> able<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
