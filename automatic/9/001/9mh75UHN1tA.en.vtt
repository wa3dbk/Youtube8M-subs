another minecraft tutorial today I'll be
showing<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.710> use<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.430> daylight<00:00:05.940> sensor

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
showing you how to use a daylight sensor

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960 
showing you how to use a daylight sensor
as<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:07.080> switch<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.770> get<00:00:07.950> an<00:00:08.099> output<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.820> can

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
as a switch to get an output so you can

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.310 
as a switch to get an output so you can
right-click<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.719> change<00:00:09.870> its<00:00:10.110> status

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
right-click on it to change its status

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
right-click on it to change its status

with me today how you doing guy good man
cool<00:00:22.350> yep<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.189> an<00:00:23.460> idea<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.970> had<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
cool yep this was an idea that I had and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.029 
cool yep this was an idea that I had and
as<00:00:24.720> soon<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.080> had<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.410> knew<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> wouldn't<00:00:25.980> be

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
as soon as I had it I knew I wouldn't be

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
as soon as I had it I knew I wouldn't be
able<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> redstone<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.180> I'd<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
able to do the redstone and I'd have to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
able to do the redstone and I'd have to
call<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> help<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.439> expert<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.070> cube

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
call in the help of an expert so cube

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.550 
call in the help of an expert so cube
has<00:00:30.000> put<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.510> thing<00:00:30.750> together<00:00:30.990> right<00:00:31.380> here

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
has put this thing together right here

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.990 
has put this thing together right here
for<00:00:31.800> us<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> explain<00:00:32.669> how<00:00:32.730> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
for us do you want to explain how it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.620 
for us do you want to explain how it
works<00:00:33.210> yeah<00:00:34.170> sure<00:00:34.850> if<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.030> look<00:00:36.149> behind<00:00:36.329> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
works yeah sure if you look behind you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.740 
works yeah sure if you look behind you
you'll<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.340> two<00:00:38.969> daylight<00:00:39.360> sensors

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
you'll see we have two daylight sensors

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.299 
you'll see we have two daylight sensors
hooked<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> United<00:00:40.800> States<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
hooked up one in the United States and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
hooked up one in the United States and
one<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.550> de<00:00:41.820> state<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:42.960> command

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
one in de state and we have command

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.959 
one in de state and we have command
blocks<00:00:43.559> cycling<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> day/night<00:00:44.489> cycle

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
blocks cycling the day/night cycle

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.630 
blocks cycling the day/night cycle
rather<00:00:45.210> quickly<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> moment<00:00:46.350> yeah<00:00:46.950> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
rather quickly at the moment yeah but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100 
rather quickly at the moment yeah but
basically<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.450> happens<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> new

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
basically what happens with the new

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.680 
basically what happens with the new
daylight<00:00:49.530> sensor<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> inverted<00:00:50.489> state<00:00:51.390> is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
daylight sensor the inverted state is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.729 
daylight sensor the inverted state is
literally<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> inverted<00:00:52.890> state<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> day

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
literally the inverted state of the day

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.150 
literally the inverted state of the day
sensor<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> total<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.780> both<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.379> daylight

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
sensor so the total of both the daylight

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.790 
sensor so the total of both the daylight
sensors<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.730> always<00:01:00.059> come<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.350> 15

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
sensors will always come down to the 15

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.820 
sensors will always come down to the 15
like<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.870> fill<00:01:03.870> each<00:01:03.989> other<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
like they really fill each other up in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.510 
like they really fill each other up in
that<00:01:05.010> aspect<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.689> use<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that aspect and you can kind of use that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.570 
that aspect and you can kind of use that
so<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> input<00:01:09.150> mechanism<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
so we have the input mechanism here and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.750 
so we have the input mechanism here and
there's<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:12.330> depending<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.369> time

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
there's like depending on on what time

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760 
there's like depending on on what time
of<00:01:14.790> day<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.360> stated<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.930> there's<00:01:16.530> always

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of day and what stated in there's always

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
of day and what stated in there's always
two<00:01:17.580> things<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.299> happen<00:01:18.450> either<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
two things that can happen either the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
two things that can happen either the
signal<00:01:20.040> strength<00:01:20.369> coming<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.970> daylight

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
signal strength coming from the daylight

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.090 
signal strength coming from the daylight
sensor<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.670> eight<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:24.540> or

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
sensor is going to be eight or more or

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.130 
sensor is going to be eight or more or
it's<00:01:26.100> gonna<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.369> seven<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.850> less<00:01:27.140> like

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it's gonna be seven or less like

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.210 
it's gonna be seven or less like
regardless<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.250> state<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:32.040> can

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
regardless of what state it is it can

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.359 
regardless of what state it is it can
but<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> never<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.409> like<00:01:34.409> both<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
but it can never be like both at the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.980 
but it can never be like both at the
same<00:01:35.549> time<00:01:35.579> depending<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> state<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.840> what

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
same time depending on the state so what

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
same time depending on the state so what
you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> hopper

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you can do is if you we have a hopper

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.030 
you can do is if you we have a hopper
here<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.479> transmitted<00:01:40.079> exactly<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> signal

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
here that transmitted exactly a signal

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.359 
here that transmitted exactly a signal
strength<00:01:41.280> seven<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.850> we're<00:01:41.939> subtracting<00:01:43.369> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
strength seven and we're subtracting so

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.020 
strength seven and we're subtracting so
what<00:01:45.119> will<00:01:45.299> happen<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.140> either<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:47.030> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
what will happen is we will either get a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.840 
what will happen is we will either get a
positive<00:01:48.659> signal<00:01:49.229> strength<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.670> get

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
positive signal strength or we will get

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
positive signal strength or we will get
a<00:01:51.030> negative<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:52.049> basically<00:01:52.439> zero<00:01:53.100> signal

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
a negative or basically zero signal

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.870 
a negative or basically zero signal
strength<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> whenever<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.320> flick<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.880> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
strength and whenever we flick it it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.030 
strength and whenever we flick it it's
going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> change<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> change<00:01:58.680> so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to change it's going to change so

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.770 
going to change it's going to change so
it's<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.490> either<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it's going to go either on from on to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.069 
it's going to go either on from on to
off<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.560> off<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.719> we<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.840> hooked

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
off or from off to on and we have hooked

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
off or from off to on and we have hooked
this<00:02:04.290> mechanism<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> dual<00:02:06.420> edge

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
this mechanism up to a dual edge

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.960 
this mechanism up to a dual edge
detector<00:02:07.320> which<00:02:08.190> gives<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> little<00:02:08.640> pulse

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
detector which gives a little pulse

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
detector which gives a little pulse
whenever<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> goes<00:02:09.720> from<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.289> off<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:10.739> from

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
whenever it goes from on to off or from

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.010 
whenever it goes from on to off or from
off<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.480> made<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> little

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
off to on it just it just made a little

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.650 
off to on it just it just made a little
pulse<00:02:13.319> then

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
pulse then

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.200 
pulse then
as<00:02:13.720> well<00:02:13.960> yeah<00:02:14.770> because<00:02:15.130> it'll<00:02:15.490> do<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> every

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
as well yeah because it'll do it every

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.390 
as well yeah because it'll do it every
I'm<00:02:16.930> not<00:02:17.110> sure<00:02:17.290> what<00:02:17.500> time<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:17.740> day<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.190> but

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
I'm not sure what time of day is but

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'm not sure what time of day is but
when<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.640> passes<00:02:19.060> over<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.420> point<00:02:19.630> between

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
when it passes over that point between

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.210 
when it passes over that point between
7:00<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.350> 8:00<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.560> thing<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.040> going<00:02:21.160> to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
7:00 and 8:00 this thing is going to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.580 
7:00 and 8:00 this thing is going to
create<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.520> signal<00:02:21.940> yeah<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.170> that's<00:02:23.350> why

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
create a signal yeah and then that's why

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.420 
create a signal yeah and then that's why
you<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.910> other<00:02:25.060> side<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:25.540> well<00:02:25.720> exactly

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you have the other side as well exactly

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.780 
you have the other side as well exactly
exactly

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
exactly

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.160 
exactly
that's<00:02:28.030> why<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> second<00:02:28.810> circuit

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
that's why we have the second circuit

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.590 
that's why we have the second circuit
here<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.460> second<00:02:30.760> circuit<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.420> so

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
here and the second circuit is just so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.350 
here and the second circuit is just so
that<00:02:31.860> during<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> day<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.790> said<00:02:34.000> like

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
that during the day and like I said like

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.480 
that during the day and like I said like
we<00:02:34.480> said<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:34.750> don't<00:02:34.870> know<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.380> exact<00:02:35.680> time<00:02:35.740> but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
we said we don't know the exact time but

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.700 
we said we don't know the exact time but
whenever<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.940> goes<00:02:37.060> from<00:02:37.240> sequence<00:02:38.080> rank<00:02:38.260> 8<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
whenever it goes from sequence rank 8 to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.340 
whenever it goes from sequence rank 8 to
7<00:02:39.070> or<00:02:39.220> from<00:02:39.340> 7<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.730> 8<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.570> little<00:02:40.900> circuit<00:02:41.230> is

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
7 or from 7 to 8 this little circuit is

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.050 
7 or from 7 to 8 this little circuit is
going<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.650> also<00:02:41.800> send<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.280> little<00:02:42.520> pulse<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.000> it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
going to also send a little pulse and it

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.830 
going to also send a little pulse and it
goes<00:02:43.210> like<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.320> yeah<00:02:44.520> yeah<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:46.360> contract

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
goes like it just yeah yeah the contract

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.050 
goes like it just yeah yeah the contract
the<00:02:46.960> pulse<00:02:47.200> from<00:02:47.460> from<00:02:48.460> our<00:02:48.580> input<00:02:48.760> mechanism

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
the pulse from from our input mechanism

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.530 
the pulse from from our input mechanism
so<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.570> doesn't<00:02:49.930> fire<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.970> when<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.420> don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
so it doesn't fire like when you don't

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.260 
so it doesn't fire like when you don't
want<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.080> exactly<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.940> little<00:02:55.060> bit

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
want it to exactly and it's a little bit

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.790 
want it to exactly and it's a little bit
big<00:02:55.420> at<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.630> moment<00:02:55.960> isn't<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.350> but<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.590> does

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
big at the moment isn't it but it does

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.130 
big at the moment isn't it but it does
exactly<00:02:57.280> what<00:02:57.460> it's<00:02:57.700> supposed<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.810> doesn't

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
exactly what it's supposed to it doesn't

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.770 
exactly what it's supposed to it doesn't
get<00:02:59.230> more<00:02:59.350> lessly<00:02:59.650> actually<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:01.270> we<00:03:01.450> we

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
get more lessly actually but we we

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.420 
get more lessly actually but we we
wanted<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.320> you<00:03:02.470> guys<00:03:02.620> had<00:03:02.680> any<00:03:03.010> ideas

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
wanted to see if you guys had any ideas

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.770 
wanted to see if you guys had any ideas
on<00:03:03.610> compacting<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.240> because<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.480> can<00:03:04.600> see

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
on compacting this because you can see

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.080 
on compacting this because you can see
it's<00:03:05.110> doable<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.190> survival<00:03:06.700> but<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.880> little

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
it's doable in survival but a little

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.850 
it's doable in survival but a little
impractical<00:03:07.450> it's<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.050> big<00:03:08.230> thing<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.650> build

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
impractical it's a big thing to build

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.640 
impractical it's a big thing to build
for<00:03:09.490> just<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.910> know<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> little<00:03:10.650> right-click

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
for just you know a little right-click

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.810 
for just you know a little right-click
you<00:03:11.860> know<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.130> open<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.460> door<00:03:12.670> or<00:03:12.760> something

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
you know to open a door or something

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.940 
you know to open a door or something
like<00:03:13.270> that<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:13.720> if<00:03:13.810> any<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.140> have<00:03:14.260> ideas<00:03:14.710> be

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
like that so if any of you have ideas be

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.830 
like that so if any of you have ideas be
sure<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.340> share<00:03:15.970> them<00:03:16.120> with<00:03:16.180> us<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.630> how<00:03:16.660> we

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
sure to share them with us on how we

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.080 
sure to share them with us on how we
could<00:03:17.020> possibly<00:03:17.170> compact<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.820> very

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
could possibly compact this it's very

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.360 
could possibly compact this it's very
fancy<00:03:19.360> though<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.990> mean<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:24.040> build<00:03:24.190> this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
fancy though I mean it is to build this

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.800 
fancy though I mean it is to build this
contraption<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.180> are<00:03:25.270> going<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> need<00:03:25.660> an

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
contraption you are going to need an

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.480 
contraption you are going to need an
area<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.320> land<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.830> four<00:03:27.130> blocks<00:03:27.250> wide

area of land that is four blocks wide
and<00:03:27.940> 17<00:03:28.660> blocks<00:03:28.930> deep<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.830> see<00:03:30.010> here<00:03:30.250> I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
and 17 blocks deep you can see here I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.160 
and 17 blocks deep you can see here I
have<00:03:30.400> highlighted<00:03:31.150> with<00:03:31.330> dark<00:03:31.600> grey<00:03:31.810> wall<00:03:32.050> the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
have highlighted with dark grey wall the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.480 
have highlighted with dark grey wall the
areas<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.530> you're<00:03:32.740> actually<00:03:33.070> going<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.310> be

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
areas that you're actually going to be

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.190 
areas that you're actually going to be
building<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.630> red<00:03:34.780> block<00:03:34.990> here

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
building in and the red block here

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.140 
building in and the red block here
represents<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.980> input<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.520> if<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.670> go<00:03:36.760> up<00:03:36.970> by

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
represents the input so if you go up by

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.240 
represents the input so if you go up by
two<00:03:37.209> blocks<00:03:37.660> place<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.470> daylight<00:03:38.800> sensor

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
two blocks place the daylight sensor

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.100 
two blocks place the daylight sensor
that's<00:03:39.520> going<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.910> be<00:03:40.030> your<00:03:40.120> input<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.720> you

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
that's going to be your input and you

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.780 
that's going to be your input and you
can<00:03:41.260> see<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:41.709> will<00:03:41.920> be<00:03:42.070> flush<00:03:42.370> with<00:03:42.670> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
can see that this will be flush with the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.000 
can see that this will be flush with the
ground<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.780> means<00:03:43.989> we<00:03:44.110> have<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.410> do<00:03:44.590> is

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
ground so that means we have to do is

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.710 
ground so that means we have to do is
find<00:03:45.280> your<00:03:45.430> ground<00:03:45.610> level<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.270> dig<00:03:46.480> down

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
find your ground level and then dig down

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.830 
find your ground level and then dig down
by<00:03:47.290> two<00:03:47.350> blocks<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:49.120> there's<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.360> green<00:03:49.600> block

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
by two blocks now there's a green block

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.380 
by two blocks now there's a green block
over<00:03:50.170> here<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.530> represents<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.400> output<00:03:51.880> so

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
over here that represents the output so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.610 
over here that represents the output so
that's<00:03:52.570> where<00:03:52.780> you'll<00:03:52.930> wire<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.230> up<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.590> a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
that's where you'll wire this up to a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.560 
that's where you'll wire this up to a
door<00:03:53.890> or<00:03:54.070> whatever<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.610> it's<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.450> to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
door or whatever it is it's going to

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.479 
door or whatever it is it's going to
activate<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.860> chest<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.280> have<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.860 
blocks and on the side of this one we
want<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.889> have<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.099> redstone<00:04:54.550> torch<00:04:54.789> then<00:04:55.629> here

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
want to have a redstone torch then here

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.510 
want to have a redstone torch then here
what<00:04:56.020> we<00:04:56.110> want<00:04:56.199> to<00:04:56.379> do<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.650> place<00:04:56.889> to<00:04:57.099> drop<00:04:57.310> is

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
what we want to do is place to drop is

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.550 
what we want to do is place to drop is
facing<00:04:57.909> forward<00:04:58.240> put<00:04:58.750> two<00:04:58.960> hoppers<00:04:59.319> facing

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
facing forward put two hoppers facing

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.860 
facing forward put two hoppers facing
into<00:05:00.190> them<00:05:00.340> like<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.419> each<00:05:01.569> of<00:05:01.780> those

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
into them like this and in each of those

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.290 
into them like this and in each of those
we<00:05:02.050> just<00:05:02.080> want<00:05:02.409> to<00:05:02.530> put<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.740> single<00:05:02.860> item<00:05:03.520> like

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
we just want to put a single item like

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.450 
we just want to put a single item like
so<00:05:04.659> then<00:05:05.349> over<00:05:05.680> here<00:05:05.800> we're<00:05:06.129> going<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.310> have

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
so then over here we're going to have

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.520 
so then over here we're going to have
two<00:05:06.639> comparators<00:05:07.169> facing<00:05:08.169> in<00:05:08.319> that<00:05:08.349> direction

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
two comparators facing in that direction

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.040 
two comparators facing in that direction
we're<00:05:09.520> going<00:05:09.639> to<00:05:09.699> put<00:05:09.849> a<00:05:09.879> block<00:05:10.150> at<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.539> back<00:05:10.750> a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
we're going to put a block at the back a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.559 
we're going to put a block at the back a
piece<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.860> redstone<00:05:12.009> in<00:05:12.340> front<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.699> it<00:05:12.879> another

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
piece of redstone in front of it another

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.510 
piece of redstone in front of it another
comparator<00:05:14.139> here<00:05:14.349> and<00:05:14.530> then<00:05:14.979> that's<00:05:15.190> going<00:05:15.400> to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
comparator here and then that's going to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.490 
comparator here and then that's going to
be<00:05:15.610> our<00:05:15.759> output<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.449> this<00:05:16.599> comparator<00:05:17.110> needs

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
be our output but this comparator needs

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.939 
be our output but this comparator needs
to<00:05:17.650> be<00:05:17.740> in<00:05:17.889> subtract<00:05:18.310> mode<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.590> now<00:05:20.800> we're

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
to be in subtract mode so now we're

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.559 
to be in subtract mode so now we're
going<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.219> build<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.610> other<00:05:21.819> half<00:05:22.150> of<00:05:22.419> the

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
going to build the other half of the

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.270 
going to build the other half of the
circuit<00:05:23.020> we<00:05:23.199> want<00:05:23.349> to<00:05:23.469> start<00:05:23.740> off<00:05:23.860> by<00:05:24.009> placing

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
circuit we want to start off by placing

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.100 
circuit we want to start off by placing
a<00:05:24.669> hopper<00:05:24.969> facing<00:05:25.389> into<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.690> ground<00:05:25.930> and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
a hopper facing into the ground and

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.570 
a hopper facing into the ground and
inside<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.650> we're<00:05:26.830> going<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.039> place<00:05:27.310> our

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
inside of that we're going to place our

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.600 
inside of that we're going to place our
items<00:05:28.509> like<00:05:28.750> so<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.289> then<00:05:29.860> on<00:05:29.979> either<00:05:30.129> side<00:05:30.460> we

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
items like so and then on either side we

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.550 
items like so and then on either side we
need<00:05:30.729> a<00:05:30.759> daylight<00:05:31.150> sensor<00:05:31.389> this<00:05:31.779> one<00:05:31.990> over

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
need a daylight sensor this one over

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.830 
need a daylight sensor this one over
here<00:05:32.710> needs<00:05:32.889> to<00:05:33.069> be<00:05:33.159> inverted<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.180> then<00:05:34.690> we'll

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
here needs to be inverted and then we'll

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.809 
here needs to be inverted and then we'll
place<00:05:35.050> three<00:05:35.409> comparators<00:05:36.069> in<00:05:36.279> a<00:05:36.370> row<00:05:36.550> and

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
place three comparators in a row and

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.939 
place three comparators in a row and
then<00:05:37.240> another<00:05:37.539> two<00:05:37.840> both<00:05:38.110> of<00:05:38.139> which<00:05:38.469> need<00:05:38.800> to

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
then another two both of which need to

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.920 
then another two both of which need to
be<00:05:39.130> on<00:05:39.340> subtract<00:05:39.880> mode<00:05:40.090> then<00:05:40.599> you<00:05:40.690> need<00:05:40.810> to

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
be on subtract mode then you need to

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.959 
be on subtract mode then you need to
place<00:05:41.139> a<00:05:41.349> piece<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.800> redstone<00:05:42.250> in<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.729> middle

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
place a piece of redstone in the middle

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.269 
place a piece of redstone in the middle
and<00:05:43.120> another<00:05:43.479> piece<00:05:43.930> over<00:05:44.199> here<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.710> then<00:05:45.069> put

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
and another piece over here and then put

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.920 
and another piece over here and then put
down<00:05:45.430> two<00:05:45.729> blocks<00:05:45.909> one<00:05:46.330> there<00:05:46.569> and<00:05:46.719> one<00:05:46.779> here

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.110 
down two blocks one there and one here
then<00:05:47.860> we<00:05:47.949> need<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.130> put<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.279> dropper<00:05:48.639> facing<00:05:49.029> in

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
then we need to put a dropper facing in

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.879 
then we need to put a dropper facing in
this<00:05:49.240> direction<00:05:49.449> another<00:05:50.080> one<00:05:50.319> facing<00:05:50.770> in

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
this direction another one facing in

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:51.959 
this direction another one facing in

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
that direction and then place two

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.779 
that direction and then place two
hoppers<00:05:52.479> facing<00:05:53.050> into<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.680> droppers<00:05:54.159> and<00:05:54.430> put

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
hoppers facing into the droppers and put

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.529 
hoppers facing into the droppers and put
a<00:05:54.819> single<00:05:55.330> item<00:05:55.479> in<00:05:55.930> each<00:05:56.590> of<00:05:56.830> those<00:05:56.979> and<00:05:57.279> then

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
a single item in each of those and then

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.790 
a single item in each of those and then
facing<00:05:58.539> out<00:05:58.659> from<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.930> hoppers<00:05:59.259> we<00:05:59.440> need<00:05:59.650> a

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
facing out from the hoppers we need a

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.189 
facing out from the hoppers we need a
comparator<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.610> another<00:06:01.419> one<00:06:01.629> there<00:06:01.870> then<00:06:02.169> a

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
comparator and another one there then a

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.080 
comparator and another one there then a
block<00:06:02.500> in<00:06:02.650> front<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:02.919> this<00:06:03.069> one<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.909> piece

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
block in front of this one and a piece

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.589 
block in front of this one and a piece
of<00:06:04.240> redstone<00:06:04.419> on<00:06:04.840> this<00:06:05.050> one<00:06:05.789> so<00:06:06.789> sunset<00:06:07.389> and

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
of redstone on this one so sunset and

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.200 
of redstone on this one so sunset and
sunrise<00:06:07.930> is<00:06:08.529> when<00:06:08.860> this<00:06:09.310> thing<00:06:09.610> will<00:06:09.819> work<00:06:09.849> if

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
sunrise is when this thing will work if

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.550 
sunrise is when this thing will work if
we<00:06:10.330> have<00:06:10.479> a<00:06:10.509> look<00:06:10.659> down<00:06:10.870> here<00:06:10.900> it's<00:06:11.289> going<00:06:11.469> to

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
we have a look down here it's going to

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.550 
we have a look down here it's going to
cancel<00:06:11.770> itself<00:06:12.279> out<00:06:12.900> there<00:06:13.900> we<00:06:13.990> go<00:06:14.169> so<00:06:14.349> you<00:06:14.379> can

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
cancel itself out there we go so you can

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.990 
cancel itself out there we go so you can
see<00:06:14.740> we<00:06:14.860> have<00:06:15.009> built<00:06:15.219> this<00:06:15.310> correctly<00:06:15.759> and<00:06:15.940> if

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
see we have built this correctly and if

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.850 
see we have built this correctly and if
we<00:06:16.090> go<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:16.360> press<00:06:16.539> this<00:06:16.750> you<00:06:16.810> can<00:06:17.080> see<00:06:17.259> the

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
we go and press this you can see the

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.680 
we go and press this you can see the
comparator<00:06:18.430> activating<00:06:19.029> giving<00:06:19.360> us<00:06:19.479> an

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
comparator activating giving us an

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.330 
comparator activating giving us an
output<00:06:19.840> so<00:06:20.560> that's<00:06:20.710> how<00:06:20.889> you<00:06:20.949> build<00:06:21.159> the

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
output so that's how you build the

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.040 
output so that's how you build the
contraption<00:06:21.729> and<00:06:22.120> again<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.449> big<00:06:22.479> thanks<00:06:22.990> to
