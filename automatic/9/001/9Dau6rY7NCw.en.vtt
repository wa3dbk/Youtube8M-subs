tablespoon or a tablespoon to have so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.440 
tablespoon or a tablespoon to have so
it's<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.050> personal<00:01:55.500> preference

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.060

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.810 
really sure but you just want to pour
that<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.959> mix<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.500> then<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.130> are<00:02:14.220> adding<00:02:14.580> in

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
that in and mix it then we are adding in

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:28.790 
that in and mix it then we are adding in
the<00:02:15.209> pepper<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.959> salt

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.260 

so<00:02:29.800> how's<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.100> chicken<00:02:30.490> all<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.880> want<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.120> do

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
so how's the chicken all you want to do

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.180 
so how's the chicken all you want to do
is<00:02:31.450> grab<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> couple<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.200> pieces<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.770> shove

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
is grab a couple of pieces and shove

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:43.350 
is grab a couple of pieces and shove
them<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:41.160> once<00:02:42.160> you've<00:02:42.370> done<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.610> just<00:02:42.820> place

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
them up once you've done that just place

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.870 
them up once you've done that just place
your<00:02:43.510> chicken<00:02:43.780> into<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> bowl<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.100> we

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
your chicken into the bowl and we

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.510 
your chicken into the bowl and we
probably<00:02:46.180> put<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.960> about<00:02:47.260> three<00:02:47.770> cups<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
probably put in about three cups of the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.940 
probably put in about three cups of the
chicken<00:02:48.820> I'm<00:02:48.940> guessing<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.170> course<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.800> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
chicken I'm guessing but of course it is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.030
