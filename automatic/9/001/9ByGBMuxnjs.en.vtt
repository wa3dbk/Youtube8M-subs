of<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> arc<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.300> believe<00:03:15.540> his<00:03:15.630> name<00:03:15.660> was<00:03:15.780> Reno

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
of the arc I believe his name was Reno

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.930 
of the arc I believe his name was Reno
ski<00:03:16.620> he<00:03:16.920> kind<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.160> looked<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.400> little<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.730> him

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
ski he kind of looked a little like him

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.730 
ski he kind of looked a little like him
so<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.390> found<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.750> little<00:03:18.990> bit<00:03:19.080> interesting

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
so I found that a little bit interesting

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.160 
so I found that a little bit interesting
maybe<00:03:20.610> coincidence<00:03:21.270> or<00:03:21.420> whatever<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.110> I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
maybe coincidence or whatever but I

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.470 
maybe coincidence or whatever but I
still<00:03:22.470> found<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.830> nonetheless<00:03:23.480> interesting

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
still found that nonetheless interesting

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.060 
still found that nonetheless interesting
an<00:03:24.600> overall<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.110> chapter<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.710> just<00:03:25.890> like

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
got Eisen in the mix and I just really

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.040 
got Eisen in the mix and I just really
want<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.090> where<00:03:33.300> things<00:03:33.450> are<00:03:33.630> leading<00:03:33.930> up

again<00:03:36.270> door<00:03:36.900> aizen's<00:03:37.470> plans<00:03:37.860> because

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
again door aizen's plans because

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.490 
again door aizen's plans because
obviously<00:03:38.460> aizen's<00:03:39.270> plans<00:03:39.510> don't<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.960> it's<00:03:40.380> a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
obviously aizen's plans don't go it's a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.440 
obviously aizen's plans don't go it's a
full<00:03:40.650> effect<00:03:40.950> basically<00:03:41.490> it<00:03:42.060> seems<00:03:42.300> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
full effect basically it seems that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.910 
full effect basically it seems that
though<00:03:42.600> Aizen<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.080> just<00:03:43.290> using<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.680> whole

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
though Aizen is just using this whole

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.610 
though Aizen is just using this whole
scenario<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> test<00:03:45.150> he's<00:03:46.020> using<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.590> a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
scenario as a test he's using it as a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.860 
scenario as a test he's using it as a
test<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.730> can't<00:03:47.940> wait<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> see<00:03:48.300> what<00:03:48.510> ryu

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
test and I can't wait to see what ryu

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.660 
test and I can't wait to see what ryu

this this is a chapter for the most part
was<00:03:53.310> really<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.670> like<00:03:53.820> got<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.300> battle<00:03:54.570> and

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
was really just like got a battle and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.810 
was really just like got a battle and
you've<00:03:55.170> got<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> setup<00:03:55.740> for<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.340> next<00:03:56.610> chapter

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you've got a setup for the next chapter

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.820 
you've got a setup for the next chapter
where<00:03:57.240> people<00:03:57.870> are<00:03:57.959> gonna<00:03:58.050> obviously<00:03:58.590> show

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
where people are gonna obviously show

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.040 
where people are gonna obviously show
obviously<00:03:59.550> aizen's<00:04:00.240> not<00:04:00.390> gonna<00:04:00.570> kill<00:04:00.840> each

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
obviously aizen's not gonna kill each

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.780 
obviously aizen's not gonna kill each
and<00:04:01.260> right<00:04:01.410> then<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.680> there<00:04:01.740> but<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.190> do<00:04:02.340> think

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
and right then and there but I do think

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.730 
and right then and there but I do think
that<00:04:03.000> whatever<00:04:03.180> happens<00:04:03.720> here<00:04:04.080> it's<00:04:04.560> gonna

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
that whatever happens here it's gonna

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.220 
that whatever happens here it's gonna
affect<00:04:05.130> eyes<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:06.150> gonna<00:04:06.270> affect<00:04:06.600> Asians

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
affect eyes it's gonna affect Asians

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.620 
affect eyes it's gonna affect Asians
Shinigami<00:04:08.190> body<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.880> possibly<00:04:09.300> even<00:04:09.390> his

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
Shinigami body and possibly even his

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.170 
Shinigami body and possibly even his
powers<00:04:10.020> because<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:11.070> feel<00:04:11.760> as<00:04:11.880> though<00:04:12.000> this

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
powers because I I feel as though this

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.520 
powers because I I feel as though this
is<00:04:12.240> where<00:04:12.540> where<00:04:12.930> it's<00:04:13.050> gonna<00:04:13.170> happen<00:04:13.380> or

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
is where where it's gonna happen or

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.870 
is where where it's gonna happen or
you're<00:04:13.680> gonna<00:04:13.770> use<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.220> move<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.760> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
you're gonna use that move that is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.460 
you're gonna use that move that is
either<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.240> final<00:04:15.540> guess<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.750> potentially<00:04:16.290> or

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
either the final guess to potentially or

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.010 
either the final guess to potentially or
similar<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.160> because<00:04:17.820> we've<00:04:18.570> seen<00:04:18.870> that

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
similar to that because we've seen that

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.449 
similar to that because we've seen that
his<00:04:19.109> move<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.410> apparently<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.890> getsu<00:04:20.280> so

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
his move is apparently and getsu so

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.860 
his move is apparently and getsu so
maybe<00:04:20.640> it's<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.910> final<00:04:21.239> end<00:04:21.390> getsu<00:04:21.750> or

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
maybe it's the final end getsu or

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.600 
maybe it's the final end getsu or
something<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.410> that's<00:04:23.100> where<00:04:23.340> he's<00:04:23.490> gonna

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
something and that's where he's gonna

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.950 
something and that's where he's gonna
lose<00:04:23.820> his<00:04:24.000> powers<00:04:24.330> or<00:04:24.479> whatever<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.810> may<00:04:24.930> be

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
lose his powers or whatever it may be

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.690 
lose his powers or whatever it may be
that's<00:04:25.440> where<00:04:25.680> quisqueya<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.130> gonna<00:04:26.280> take<00:04:26.520> him

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
that's where quisqueya is gonna take him

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.320 
that's where quisqueya is gonna take him
in

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
in

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.420 
in
and<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.810> know<00:04:27.900> he's<00:04:28.020> gonna<00:04:28.169> give<00:04:28.830> him<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:29.039> gig<00:04:29.250> I

may be a very good gig i whatever the
case<00:04:32.280> may<00:04:32.460> be<00:04:32.490> because<00:04:32.879> how<00:04:33.210> does<00:04:33.720> he<00:04:33.840> have
