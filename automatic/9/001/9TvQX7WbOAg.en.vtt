00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello friends my name is Olga 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.270
 ermilova and and today i want to talk to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.080
 you about the wedding business 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.500
 Well, in particular about what you or we 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 so they called today when 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.330
 watch the life of other wedding 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.960
 organizers of various naturally 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.029
 you observe because there are social networks and you 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.160
 willy-nilly you are witnesses 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.820
 you see that a lot is being done 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 enterprises each announces some 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.890
 event some course some new 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.550
 a service well, a lot of things but at the same time 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.649
 the fact that in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.760
 the result is an organizer but the fact itself 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 the fact that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.129
 what do we have because when 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.829
 watching from the side of someone that 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.500
 it seems that a person does a lot 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.489
 and not knowing what's really behind all this 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.559
 Well, what is the result? 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 man has a lot of things 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 very busy maybe it's true and that's 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.490
 accordingly many others 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.290
 colleague organizers start too 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 copy too as it were breaking into 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.390
 some activity and here if 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.540
 for example and a few years ago such 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 people stood out because 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 own organizers but so general 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.080
 the mass did nothing and accordingly 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.330
 If a person starts to do something that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.159
 he already stood out to him more 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.530
 customers and so on he had 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 bigger and better than it today 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.630
 the situation has changed so everyone started 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.579
 something to do and they do because 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.470
 what does he like because he is in it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.299
 believes or because he understands how 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 do and do solely by reason 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.520
 the fact that everyone else is doing something I'm 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.649
 I will also do something and in fact you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.479
 very busy and you have a lot 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 do everything painted and you also feel 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.670
 that you are tired 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.350
 but at the same time when you start 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.119
 actually consider what you got 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.100
 Now with all that you have done well 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.479
 you can actually count here 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.390
 succeeded or failed only 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.280
 in one way with money 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.280
 the fact that the money shows how much 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.980
 you have turned on some very specific 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.080
 you did it and when you think that 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.090
 often you see what happened somehow 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.910
 not really or not at all like you and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.340
 supposed especially if you count 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.890
 generally as system worth your time 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.750
 Yes, and how much you got here in a month 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.340
 there are two or three of their work then sometimes 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.160
 it becomes very disappointing because 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.989
 understand those moments that could 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.050
 earn as an employee this 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.450
 more and here it is observed 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.160
 pechalka well there is a second category of people 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.780
 who think anything better at all 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.970
 I will not do it because my hands 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.580
 drop anyway nothing works 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.090
 and this is also not true this is also sadness and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.190
 so I finally decided to invite you 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.050
 on free master class such 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.380
 it turns out I also have an auction 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.510
 generosity and next thursday i invite 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.380
 take you to a master class for wedding 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.650
 the organizers 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.380
 during which we will deal with you in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.330
 tom where money all the same lives in 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.040
 wedding business they are definitely here 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.820
 there is how to find them and how in general 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.079
 extract from this huge list 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.209
 actions that need to be done 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.700
 directly to you so that it 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.110
 brought you the result actually 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.360
 which we could sense 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.260
 they are just activities and sensations 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.989
 employment but at the same time deny yourself not 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.970
 only there summer holiday or in winter but 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.560

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.340
 same trouble so come to my 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.100

 we 'll deal with this difficult but 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.540
