Martin is concerned the Viraj is an

entirely logical progression from the

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.340 
entirely logical progression from the
db9<00:00:39.390> squeezing<00:00:40.390> itself<00:00:40.720> into<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.110> range

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
db9 squeezing itself into the range

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.940 
db9 squeezing itself into the range
between<00:00:41.739> that<00:00:42.070> car<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:43.329> more<00:00:43.480> powerful

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
between that car and the more powerful

between that car and the more powerful
expensive<00:00:44.950> DBS<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:46.539> certainly<00:00:47.109> sounds

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
expensive DBS which certainly sounds

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.830 
expensive DBS which certainly sounds
like<00:00:47.949> plausible<00:00:48.670> enough<00:00:48.879> of<00:00:49.090> justification

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
like plausible enough of justification

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.650 
like plausible enough of justification
for<00:00:50.079> what<00:00:50.199> is<00:00:50.379> undeniably<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.520> very<00:00:52.059> beautiful

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
for what is undeniably a very beautiful

for what is undeniably a very beautiful
looking<00:00:52.870> car<00:00:53.019> but<00:00:55.109> is<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.260> Virage<00:00:56.590> actually

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.720 
looking car but is the Virage actually
just<00:00:57.730> an<00:00:57.850> Aston<00:00:58.329> too<00:00:58.600> far<00:00:58.929> a<00:00:59.280> signpost<00:01:00.280> that

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
just an Aston too far a signpost that

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.360 
just an Aston too far a signpost that
the<00:01:00.940> modern<00:01:01.300> era<00:01:01.539> of<00:01:01.809> Aston<00:01:02.230> Martin<00:01:02.649> has

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
the modern era of Aston Martin has

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.360 
the modern era of Aston Martin has
ground<00:01:03.789> creatively<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.840> a<00:01:04.870> halt<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.440> guess

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
ground creatively to a halt I guess

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:14.070 
ground creatively to a halt I guess
that's<00:01:06.580> what<00:01:06.730> we're<00:01:06.850> here<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.060> find<00:01:07.240> out

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.440 

so<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.170> boss<00:01:15.410> faster<00:01:15.770> Martin<00:01:16.400> dr.<00:01:16.790> Ulrich<00:01:17.180> Bez

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
so the boss faster Martin dr. Ulrich Bez

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.020 
so the boss faster Martin dr. Ulrich Bez
says<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.500> there<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:18.860> no<00:01:19.250> need<00:01:19.550> for<00:01:20.000> a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
says that there is no need for a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.740 
says that there is no need for a
revolution<00:01:20.690> at<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.230> company<00:01:21.650> hence<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:23.450> car

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
revolution at the company hence this car

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.350 
revolution at the company hence this car
is<00:01:23.960> basically<00:01:24.530> more<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.760> same<00:01:25.940> but

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
is basically more of the same but

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.500 
is basically more of the same but
different<00:01:26.420> which<00:01:27.110> means<00:01:27.410> you<00:01:27.800> get<00:01:27.950> more<00:01:28.130> power

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
different which means you get more power

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.990 
different which means you get more power
you<00:01:29.510> can<00:01:29.690> slightly<00:01:29.960> shorter<00:01:30.470> gearing<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:31.790> get

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
you can slightly shorter gearing you get

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.330 
you can slightly shorter gearing you get
quite<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.420> lot<00:01:32.720> more<00:01:32.840> performance<00:01:33.470> than<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.920> db9

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
quite a lot more performance than a db9

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.230 
quite a lot more performance than a db9
in<00:01:34.850> fact<00:01:35.210> what<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.230> almost<00:01:36.530> get<00:01:37.040> is<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> DBS<00:01:37.760> but

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
in fact what you almost get is a DBS but

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.780 
in fact what you almost get is a DBS but
basically<00:01:38.780> with<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> bit<00:01:39.110> more<00:01:39.290> comfort<00:01:39.790> what

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
basically with a bit more comfort what

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.030 
basically with a bit more comfort what
does<00:01:40.940> all<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.090> add<00:01:41.450> up<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:41.770> well<00:01:42.770> in

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
does all that add up to well in

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.390 
does all that add up to well in
isolation<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:45.260> adds<00:01:45.470> up<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.830> car<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.130> is

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
isolation it adds up to a car that is

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.230 
isolation it adds up to a car that is
frankly<00:01:46.930> fantastic<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:49.190> get<00:01:49.430> huge<00:01:49.820> amounts

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
