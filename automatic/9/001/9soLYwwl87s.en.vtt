mechanism<00:04:24.010> everything<00:04:25.710> 103<00:04:26.710> years<00:04:26.890> ago<00:04:27.190> was

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
mechanism everything 103 years ago was

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.040 
mechanism everything 103 years ago was
the<00:04:27.700> most<00:04:27.910> expensive<00:04:28.240> item<00:04:28.480> with<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.780> clock

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
the most expensive item with the clock

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.170 
the most expensive item with the clock
of<00:04:29.230> eval<00:04:29.560> we're<00:04:30.310> talking<00:04:30.490> dollars<00:04:30.910> together

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
of eval we're talking dollars together

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.350 
of eval we're talking dollars together
Wow<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.350> then<00:04:32.650> we<00:04:32.800> see<00:04:32.919> what<00:04:33.040> most<00:04:33.360> now

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
Wow and then we see what most now

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.300 
Wow and then we see what most now
where's<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.110> old<00:04:35.230> pendulum<00:04:35.800> isn't<00:04:36.250> it

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
where's the the old pendulum isn't it

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.480 
where's the the old pendulum isn't it
laying<00:04:36.490> around<00:04:36.850> in<00:04:36.970> here<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.930> older<00:04:38.860> girl<00:04:39.310> i

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
laying around in here the older girl i

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.010 
laying around in here the older girl i
know<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.910> long<00:04:40.120> thing<00:04:40.419> with<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.690> weight<00:04:40.840> on

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
know that long thing with the weight on

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.570 
know that long thing with the weight on
the<00:04:41.169> end<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.890> used<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.100> come<00:04:42.250> right<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.460> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
the end that I used to come right to the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.270 
the end that I used to come right to the
floor<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.200> saw<00:04:44.200> some<00:04:44.230> parts<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.860> when<00:04:45.070> you're

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
floor I saw some parts of it when you're

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.070 
floor I saw some parts of it when you're
like<00:04:45.370> right<00:04:45.580> here<00:04:45.820> but<00:04:46.450> wait<00:04:46.630> right<00:04:46.930> down

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
like right here but wait right down

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.940 
like right here but wait right down
there<00:04:47.640> yeah<00:04:48.640> but<00:04:49.120> that's<00:04:49.540> oh<00:04:50.050> yeah<00:04:50.620> there's

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
there yeah but that's oh yeah there's

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.159 
there yeah but that's oh yeah there's
some<00:04:51.310> ball<00:04:51.580> yeah<00:04:52.060> they<00:04:52.330> used<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.660> users<00:04:52.990> we

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
some ball yeah they used to users we

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.950 
some ball yeah they used to users we
have<00:04:53.290> probably<00:04:53.650> sat<00:04:53.950> every<00:04:54.250> eight<00:04:54.370> days<00:04:54.960> and

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
have probably sat every eight days and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.540 
have probably sat every eight days and
it's<00:04:56.500> come<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.890> fore<00:04:57.100> from<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.310> clock

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
it's come to the fore from the clock

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.640 
it's come to the fore from the clock
mechanism<00:04:57.790> out<00:04:58.210> there<00:04:58.419> right<00:04:58.870> it's<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.500> light

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
mechanism out there right it's a light

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.129 
mechanism out there right it's a light
bulb<00:04:59.890> up<00:05:00.070> there<00:05:00.100> now

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:11.100 

it's<00:05:03.710> four<00:05:03.979> o'clock<00:05:04.069> make<00:05:04.939> it<00:05:05.150> right<00:05:06.069> Wow<00:05:07.069> oh

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.450 

we're<00:05:12.110> not<00:05:12.139> one<00:05:12.439> up<00:05:12.529> there<00:05:12.710> you<00:05:13.039> can<00:05:13.249> if<00:05:13.370> you

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
we're not one up there you can if you

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.450 
we're not one up there you can if you
wish<00:05:17.319> well<00:05:18.319> I'm<00:05:18.469> going<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.680> pause<00:05:18.860> here<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.310> go

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
wish well I'm going to pause here and go

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.809 
wish well I'm going to pause here and go
up<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.580> stairs<00:05:19.999> well<00:05:21.219> this<00:05:22.219> is<00:05:22.370> it<00:05:22.520> kitties

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
up the stairs well this is it kitties

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.559 
up the stairs well this is it kitties
this<00:05:23.810> is<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.229> clock<00:05:24.439> room<00:05:25.180> looks<00:05:26.180> like<00:05:26.300> they

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
this is the clock room looks like they

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.950 
this is the clock room looks like they
were<00:05:26.629> doing<00:05:26.900> some<00:05:27.610> work<00:05:28.610> way<00:05:28.849> up<00:05:29.060> there<00:05:29.360> it's

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
were doing some work way up there it's

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.050 
were doing some work way up there it's
the<00:05:30.050> ladder<00:05:30.289> there<00:05:32.229> here<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:34.580> can<00:05:34.759> see<00:05:35.029> the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
the ladder there here you can see the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.040 
the ladder there here you can see the
gear<00:05:36.020> mechanism<00:05:37.000> on<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.180> top<00:05:38.479> of<00:05:38.509> the<00:05:38.750> clock

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
gear mechanism on the top of the clock

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.830 
gear mechanism on the top of the clock
here<00:05:39.550> make<00:05:40.550> sure<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.759> don't<00:05:40.879> fall<00:05:41.120> kill<00:05:41.629> myself

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
here make sure I don't fall kill myself

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.420 
here make sure I don't fall kill myself
here<00:05:45.460> it's<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.580> actual<00:05:46.759> old<00:05:48.099> clock<00:05:49.099> mechanism

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
here it's the actual old clock mechanism

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.499 
here it's the actual old clock mechanism
here's<00:05:50.409> where<00:05:51.409> we<00:05:51.650> just<00:05:51.860> came<00:05:51.949> from<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:56.300> can

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
here's where we just came from you can

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:02.980 
here's where we just came from you can
see<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:58.000> little<00:05:59.770> bird<00:06:00.770> doors<00:06:01.629> see<00:06:02.629> that<00:06:02.810> one

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
see the little bird doors see that one

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.269 
see the little bird doors see that one
there<00:06:03.259> is<00:06:03.409> nailed<00:06:04.219> shut<00:06:05.740> so<00:06:06.740> no<00:06:06.919> over<00:06:07.069> here

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
there is nailed shut so no over here

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.089 
there is nailed shut so no over here
looks<00:06:07.520> like<00:06:07.699> it<00:06:07.879> might<00:06:08.089> open<00:06:08.740> you<00:06:09.740> can<00:06:09.919> see

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
looks like it might open you can see

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.950 
looks like it might open you can see
some<00:06:10.339> sort<00:06:10.580> of<00:06:10.729> four<00:06:11.389> corners<00:06:12.099> lit

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
some sort of four corners lit

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.290 
some sort of four corners lit
each<00:06:14.380> one<00:06:14.620> of<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.800> faces<00:06:15.310> there

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
each one of the faces there

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.610 
each one of the faces there
that<00:06:17.930> one's<00:06:18.139> not<00:06:18.379> really<00:06:18.680> lit

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.940 

for<00:06:22.220> sure

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
for sure

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.930 
for sure
see<00:06:24.550> light<00:06:24.820> through<00:06:24.850> there<00:06:26.580> here's<00:06:27.580> one<00:06:27.790> of

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
see light through there here's one of

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.319 
see light through there here's one of
the<00:06:27.970> doors

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:29.329 
the doors

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:33.349 
the doors
how<00:06:30.329> here's<00:06:31.169> some<00:06:31.439> of<00:06:31.559> the<00:06:32.059> close-up<00:06:33.059> of<00:06:33.209> the

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:33.359 
how here's some of the close-up of the

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:43.729 
how here's some of the close-up of the
mechanism<00:06:39.259> now<00:06:40.259> these<00:06:42.229> this<00:06:43.229> is<00:06:43.439> the

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:43.739 
mechanism now these this is the

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:46.249 
mechanism now these this is the
mechanism<00:06:44.699> in<00:06:45.089> the<00:06:45.179> middle<00:06:45.449> here<00:06:45.479> and<00:06:45.869> it<00:06:46.049> goes

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
mechanism in the middle here and it goes

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:52.309 
mechanism in the middle here and it goes
to<00:06:46.529> the<00:06:46.559> four<00:06:47.329> hands<00:06:48.379> as<00:06:49.379> you<00:06:49.559> can<00:06:49.769> see<00:06:51.319> that's

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
to the four hands as you can see that's

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.699 
to the four hands as you can see that's
some<00:06:52.849> early<00:06:53.849> elaborate<00:06:54.449> gearing<00:06:55.109> in<00:06:55.259> there<00:06:55.499> I

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:55.709 
some early elaborate gearing in there I

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.609 
some early elaborate gearing in there I
was<00:06:56.699> told<00:06:56.969> when<00:06:57.179> I<00:06:57.269> was<00:06:57.419> here<00:06:57.599> before<00:06:57.629> that

00:06:58.609 --> 00:06:58.619 
was told when I was here before that

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:03.439 
was told when I was here before that
these<00:06:58.919> rods<00:06:59.459> are<00:06:59.969> flex<00:07:00.959> rods<00:07:01.319> and<00:07:01.789> they<00:07:02.789> twist

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
these rods are flex rods and they twist

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.479 
these rods are flex rods and they twist
and<00:07:03.689> break<00:07:03.959> like<00:07:04.319> if<00:07:04.499> the<00:07:04.649> hands<00:07:05.069> were<00:07:05.249> to

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:05.489 
and break like if the hands were to

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:12.409 
and break like if the hands were to
become<00:07:05.610> jammed<00:07:09.409> here<00:07:10.409> we<00:07:10.529> can<00:07:11.149> look<00:07:12.149> at<00:07:12.269> the

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
become jammed here we can look at the

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.899 
become jammed here we can look at the
actual<00:07:12.749> clock<00:07:13.169> mechanism<00:07:13.499> and<00:07:14.129> I<00:07:14.219> assume<00:07:14.669> it

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.279 
actual clock mechanism and I assume it
is<00:07:15.059> running<00:07:15.709> right<00:07:16.709> now<00:07:16.739> what<00:07:17.369> time<00:07:17.579> is<00:07:17.759> it

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
is running right now what time is it

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.529 
is running right now what time is it
it's<00:07:19.289> 22<00:07:19.529> after<00:07:20.099> well<00:07:20.939> I<00:07:20.969> don't<00:07:21.089> think<00:07:21.419> we'll

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
it's 22 after well I don't think we'll

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:26.389 
it's 22 after well I don't think we'll
be<00:07:21.599> hearing<00:07:21.689> the<00:07:22.909> clock<00:07:23.909> go<00:07:24.149> off<00:07:24.179> here<00:07:25.399> any

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:26.399

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:30.979

time<00:07:26.579> real<00:07:26.909> soon<00:07:29.209> quite<00:07:30.209> a<00:07:30.239> bit<00:07:30.449> more<00:07:30.599> cleaned

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:30.989

up<00:07:31.289> oh<00:07:32.209> there's<00:07:33.209> something<00:07:33.569> just<00:07:33.599> moved<00:07:37.519> seems

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:38.519 
up oh there's something just moved seems

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:41.269 
up oh there's something just moved seems
to<00:07:38.699> be<00:07:39.019> quite<00:07:40.019> a<00:07:40.139> bit<00:07:40.349> more<00:07:40.469> cleaned<00:07:40.860> up<00:07:41.099> than

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:41.279 
to be quite a bit more cleaned up than

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:47.570 
to be quite a bit more cleaned up than
the<00:07:41.369> way<00:07:41.489> I<00:07:41.519> remember<00:07:41.699> it

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.399 

but<00:07:48.090> I<00:07:48.210> understand<00:07:48.689> this<00:07:48.870> is<00:07:48.930> still<00:07:49.379> the

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:49.409 
but I understand this is still the

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:53.479 
but I understand this is still the
original<00:07:50.090> clock<00:07:51.090> mechanism
