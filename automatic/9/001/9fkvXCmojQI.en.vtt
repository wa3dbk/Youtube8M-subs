00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
probably looking at this like exact same

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.970

now instead of a twenty percent chance
you<00:03:43.690> have<00:03:43.780> an<00:03:43.870> eight<00:03:44.110> percent<00:03:44.680> chance<00:03:44.950> and

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
you have an eight percent chance and

generation<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:54.720> roughly<00:03:55.720> hashed<00:03:56.129> but<00:03:57.129> it's

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
generation is roughly hashed but it's

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.400 
generation is roughly hashed but it's
also<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.060> fact<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.390> it's<00:03:58.569> harder<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.930> spend

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410
