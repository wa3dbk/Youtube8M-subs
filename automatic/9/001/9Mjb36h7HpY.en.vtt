00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
if I did that I could for example change

the YouTube video size to be stupidly
small<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.719> everyone<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.259> complain<00:02:07.710> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
small and then everyone will complain on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
small and then everyone will complain on
Twitter<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.759> there's<00:02:08.970> been<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> YouTube

Twitter that there's been a YouTube
change<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.800> can't<00:02:11.069> do<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:11.670> be

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
change we can't do that that would be

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.100 
change we can't do that that would be
hacking<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.480> hacking<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
hacking and that's hacking the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.020 
hacking and that's hacking the
code<00:02:13.230> server-side<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.100> what<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.820> is

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
code server-side but what we can do is

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.660 
code server-side but what we can do is
to<00:02:15.450> our<00:02:15.540> own<00:02:15.690> custom<00:02:16.200> CSS<00:02:16.680> through<00:02:17.430> our

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
to our own custom CSS through our

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.000 
to our own custom CSS through our
browser<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.960> firstly<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.440> need<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.770> what

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
browser so firstly we need to know what

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.890 
browser so firstly we need to know what
CSS<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> website<00:02:21.120> has<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.660> right<00:02:21.870> click

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
CSS the website has so if I right click

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.930 
CSS the website has so if I right click
on<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.590> little<00:02:22.800> area<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.340> find<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:23.670> what's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
on this little area and find out what's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.720 
on this little area and find out what's
here<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.660> inspect<00:02:25.080> element<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
here I can go to inspect element and it

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.580 
here I can go to inspect element and it
will<00:02:26.910> pretty<00:02:27.360> much<00:02:27.480> show<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.290> area<00:02:28.470> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
will pretty much show me the area of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.350 
will pretty much show me the area of
code<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:28.950> looking<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.670> entire<00:02:30.060> bit

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
code I'm looking at for this entire bit

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.150 
code I'm looking at for this entire bit
and<00:02:30.570> on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.020> right<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> shows<00:02:31.350> me<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> style

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
and on the right it shows me the style

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.760 
and on the right it shows me the style
is<00:02:32.640> being<00:02:33.000> put<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:34.650> it's

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
is being put on this as you can see it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.920 
is being put on this as you can see it's
quite<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.040> desktop<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.610> YouTube<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.150> quite<00:02:36.450> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
quite in desktop so YouTube is quite a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.280 
quite in desktop so YouTube is quite a
heavy<00:02:37.410> site<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> that's<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:40.050> start

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
heavy site so that's that I can start

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.260 
heavy site so that's that I can start
changing<00:02:40.500> things<00:02:40.800> inside<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.430> area<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
changing things inside this area this so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.180 
changing things inside this area this so
for<00:02:42.480> example<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.870> width<00:02:43.140> 100%<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.980> could

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
for example this width 100% I could

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.970 
for example this width 100% I could
change<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.060> 20<00:02:45.360> as<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.020> see<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:46.830> doing

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
change to 20 as you can see as I'm doing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.130 
change to 20 as you can see as I'm doing
it<00:02:47.220> does<00:02:47.459> things<00:02:47.610> live<00:02:47.940> starts<00:02:48.690> moving<00:02:49.020> my

it does things live starts moving my
video<00:02:49.380> around<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.920> again<00:02:50.130> if<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.370> did<00:02:50.550> this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
video around so again if I did this

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.729 
video around so again if I did this
server-side<00:02:51.239> everyone<00:02:52.170> might<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> little

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
server-side everyone might be a little

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.470 
server-side everyone might be a little
bit<00:02:52.920> annoyed<00:02:53.160> they<00:02:53.730> are<00:02:53.850> moving<00:02:54.060> their<00:02:54.239> video

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
people who made the website is for them

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.810 
people who made the website is for them
to<00:03:18.000> edit<00:03:18.390> their<00:03:18.930> code<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.739> way<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.310> put<00:03:20.700> it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
to edit their code that way and put it

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.880 
to edit their code that way and put it
that<00:03:21.030> side<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> sends<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.410> new<00:03:22.650> version

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
that side so it sends that new version

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.190 
that side so it sends that new version
of<00:03:23.190> edited<00:03:23.549> code<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.390> then<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.959> see

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
of edited code to you and then you see

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.199 
of edited code to you and then you see
the<00:03:25.320> change<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:26.549> we<00:03:26.640> need<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.850> do<00:03:27.090> is

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
the change so what we need to do is

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.630

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
like JavaScript hacks that do this but

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.900 
like JavaScript hacks that do this but
this<00:04:40.410> does<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> permanent<00:04:41.160> thing<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.820> you'll

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
this does a permanent thing that you'll

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.790 
this does a permanent thing that you'll
see<00:04:42.000> every<00:04:42.330> time<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.630> visit<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.900> page<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.740> you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
see every time you visit the page so you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.140 
see every time you visit the page so you
can<00:04:43.950> take<00:04:44.130> out<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.310> stuff<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.700> don't<00:04:44.850> like

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
can take out the stuff you don't like

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.270 
can take out the stuff you don't like
and<00:04:45.390> keep<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.960> stuff<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.860> do<00:04:47.070> you're

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
and keep the stuff that you do you're

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.430 
and keep the stuff that you do you're
basically<00:04:47.640> web<00:04:47.880> designing<00:04:48.390> on<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.570> fly<00:04:48.900> so

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
basically web designing on the fly so

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.860 
basically web designing on the fly so
this<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.520> basic<00:04:51.090> area<00:04:51.480> in<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
this is just the basic area in the

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.750 
this is just the basic area in the
advanced<00:04:52.350> area<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.680> can<00:04:52.800> apply<00:04:53.040> your<00:04:53.220> own<00:04:53.400> CSS

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
advanced area you can apply your own CSS

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.270 
advanced area you can apply your own CSS
code<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.300> if<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:54.480> do<00:04:54.750> know<00:04:54.930> CSS<00:04:55.380> code<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:56.070> is

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
code so if you do know CSS code this is

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.740 
code so if you do know CSS code this is
where<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.550> go<00:04:56.790> or<00:04:57.090> if<00:04:57.210> you<00:04:57.330> want<00:04:57.480> to<00:04:57.540> learn

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
where you go or if you want to learn

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.990 
where you go or if you want to learn
then<00:04:58.230> you'll<00:04:58.470> see<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.890> have<00:04:59.130> CSS<00:04:59.610> for<00:04:59.880> the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
then you'll see I have CSS for the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.810 
then you'll see I have CSS for the
specific<00:05:00.540> element<00:05:00.960> are<00:05:01.260> these<00:05:01.770> properties<00:05:02.430> so

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
specific element are these properties so

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.610 
specific element are these properties so
that<00:05:03.030> way<00:05:03.420> I<00:05:03.450> can<00:05:03.690> now<00:05:03.930> know<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.440> font

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
that way I can now know that the font

that way I can now know that the font
size<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.920> 30<00:05:05.130> px<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.820> everything<00:05:06.420> is<00:05:06.540> getting

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
size is 30 px and everything is getting

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.480 
size is 30 px and everything is getting
saved<00:05:06.990> so<00:05:07.260> if<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.500> now<00:05:07.830> close<00:05:08.070> out<00:05:08.280> of<00:05:08.310> this

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
saved so if I now close out of this

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.030 
saved so if I now close out of this
refresh<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.330> page<00:05:09.510> now<00:05:10.260> this<00:05:10.500> won't<00:05:10.650> apply<00:05:10.920> to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.220 
certain things that are made dynamically
so<00:05:12.930> for<00:05:13.140> example<00:05:13.760> my<00:05:14.760> little<00:05:15.690> thing<00:05:15.960> here

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
so for example my little thing here

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.900 
so for example my little thing here
which<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:16.530> controlled<00:05:17.100> by<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.490> believe<00:05:17.730> to<00:05:17.820> be

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
which is controlled by I believe to be
