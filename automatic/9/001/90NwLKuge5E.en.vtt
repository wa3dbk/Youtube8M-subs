one of their newer products it's the
first<00:00:50.840> time<00:00:51.020> for<00:00:51.260> me<00:00:51.410> trying<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.430> product

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
first time for me trying this product

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.910 
first time for me trying this product
and<00:00:53.000> I'm<00:00:53.149> actually<00:00:53.450> in<00:00:54.050> love<00:00:54.290> with<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:54.800> I

and I'm actually in love with it and I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.709 
and I'm actually in love with it and I
think<00:00:54.980> I'm<00:00:55.520> going<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.880> purchase<00:00:56.360> another

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
think I'm going to purchase another

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.319 
think I'm going to purchase another
bottle<00:00:57.290> because<00:00:57.920> this<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.399> just<00:00:58.640> three<00:00:58.969> fluid

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
bottle because this is just three fluid

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.500 
bottle because this is just three fluid
ounces<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.989> my<00:01:00.469> hair<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.219> pretty<00:01:01.430> long<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:02.030> so

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
ounces and my hair is pretty long and so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.990 
ounces and my hair is pretty long and so
it<00:01:02.629> takes<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:03.050> lot<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.469> oil<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:04.070> moisturize<00:01:04.280> my

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
it takes a lot of oil to moisturize my

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.440 
it takes a lot of oil to moisturize my
hair<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.350> think<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:06.920> will<00:01:07.190> need<00:01:07.520> another

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
hair and so I think I will need another

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.590 
hair and so I think I will need another
bottle<00:01:08.869> because<00:01:09.320> with<00:01:09.500> one<00:01:09.860> time<00:01:10.550> about<00:01:10.850> here

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
bottle because with one time about here

three<00:02:02.810> dollars<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.229> change<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.430> thought<00:02:04.700> I

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
three dollars and change and I thought I

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.130 
three dollars and change and I thought I
would<00:02:05.030> come<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:05.509> share<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.840> with<00:02:05.990> you
