00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.340
 throw a potion frequently asked question 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.679
 he tried to suffer with him 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 the answer is very simple you have to cook any 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.360
 the potion which effect we want and then 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.640
 just make it explode it to you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.699
 of course you need to do some 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.939
 potion at the moment we will make a potion 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.939

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.140
 Well, make him an invisibility potion. 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 here respectively recipes 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.750
 here we have little interesting while I 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.720
 where line of sight is now strengthened to 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.720
 8 minutes 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.650
