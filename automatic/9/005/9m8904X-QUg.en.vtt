we're going to go ahead and go right
into<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> game<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.119> basically<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.840> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
into the game so basically what this is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.410 
into the game so basically what this is
is<00:01:19.049> first<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.770> five<00:01:20.100> wins<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.210> actually

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
is first to five wins and it actually

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
is first to five wins and it actually
gets<00:01:21.810> pretty<00:01:22.229> challenging<00:01:22.920> even<00:01:23.100> though

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
gets pretty challenging even though

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.789 
gets pretty challenging even though
you're<00:01:23.490> playing<00:01:23.759> against<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> bot<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
you're playing against a bot and I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219 
you're playing against a bot and I
imagine<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.420> challenging<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
imagine that this is how challenging the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.920 
imagine that this is how challenging the
original<00:01:28.770> pong<00:01:29.130> game<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.299> never<00:01:30.720> actually

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
original pong game was I never actually

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.499 
original pong game was I never actually
have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.100> experience<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:33.030> actually

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
have to have the experience to actually

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
have to have the experience to actually
experience<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.590> original<00:01:35.159> pong<00:01:35.400> game<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.820> an

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
experience the original pong game on an

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.120 
experience the original pong game on an
Atari<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.439> know<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.009> I've
