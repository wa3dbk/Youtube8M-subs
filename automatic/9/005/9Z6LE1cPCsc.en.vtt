00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.860
 hello everyone in this video vi 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 I will teach how to make the tulip for this 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.050
 shape we need a colored balloon ed 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 a green balloon to make the field 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:33.660
 let's start by inflating the balloon 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 colored the colored balloon must 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:46.100
 remain deflated by about four five 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 ok fingers let's start by making twists 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:55.489
 roughly five fingers apart one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.489
 on the other all the same 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:20.040
 the first two sessions are combined with 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:27.720
 the pigtail begins a third twist 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:30.600
 at the same distance as the others was 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.259
 made to pass inside the two 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.259
 manned 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.500
 now let's start twisting a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.500
 distance to a greater distance 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:07.670
 let's proceed with those first 22 sights and one 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 third long as I had two previous ones 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.610
 which we will leave aside for now while 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:27.920
 smaller parts 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:27.920
 we will help come now to a third party 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.310
 excess air must be removed for 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.690
 this is done a little hole in the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.350
 double part of the balloon and the area 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.350
 let it out 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.730
 this is the tulip head came 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.300
 less 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.490
 next test does not matter with piero 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.730
 totally because the last part does not 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:18.550
 serves now we live 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:25.570
 the beginning of the green balloon is one 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:33.520
 tip let's move on and then think of 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:39.940
 them in this way now let's do one 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:42.960
 small ball in the green balloon and the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.960
 let's do different 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:04:05.830
 now a small one has died in ours 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:04:07.920
 baby girl let's do it here at this point 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.050
 we just need to do the leaf 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.480
 we decide the length of the stem 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:25.840
 we make a function and an excellent one 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:31.060
 solution to merge I was not a bit of 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.950
 forms our leaf and finally 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.950
 cut the two excess parts 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.860
 here down below I hope you will 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.860
 like it and the next video
