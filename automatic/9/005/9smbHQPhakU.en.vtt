00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.260
 i would just say what an off and we have to appear in the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.710
 Talk about it and they had said rather 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.040
 It is not that that was almost superfluous harvested the rhine-main 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.370
 weird but see what is the response to this car 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.290
 Dr percent not surprisingly very good mood 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.090
 that is it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.660
 they build the car 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.800
 Percent quite so far we are not yet say in Molsheim 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.710
 No, shown the car to our birthday guests 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 it has been in Los Angeles afterwards in Dubai 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.500
 Of course we researched everywhere 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.030
 until now everything was 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.100
 with best results 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 like summer if this goes on more we will see 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 No better March in the house high which coffee I can not what the obituary 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.620
 Lose the percent that is the goal of the car is simply described we had 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.720
 made us 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 the most elegant 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.020
 and fastest 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.270
 the musician of the world to build Trittin 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.680
 yes that's the job and of course you do it so it was not without it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.040
 feed important ingredients 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.360
 for example the engine 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.310
 is he 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.200
 Fortunately, the well-known 16-cylinder 8-liter is also a built-in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.570
 but this time 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.000
 with a two-stage compressor 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.410
 so that we have a bit more torque for the bottom 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 Researchers preliminary round the museums customers 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.859
 we also have this engine in this vehicle as a flex fuel engine 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.279
 equipped that means some of the band loads 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.029
 He can also drive with parents or with bioethanol, which of course also 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.029
 an important detail and is 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.839
 Four-wheel drive is standard 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.289
 huge ceramic brakes 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.769
 everything that such an author needs but then a whole bunch of nicer 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.579
 installed smaller mixed 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.119
 Percent they see for example that they do not see at the moment but the wheel hubs 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.789
 are 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.129
 will be seen lit up 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.099
 But see the percent in the dark 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.069
 the Finnair behind with the third brake light 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.429
 and the arthroscopy Rosin quotes the famous Bugatti Atlantic 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.039
 the hood "They saw that in the movie 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.289
 is a battery full construction the chamber electricians and impoverish 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.049
 so on, as the others still may tell a peculiarity 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.329
 still in the interior 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.369
 our partner has the watch company Ramadani 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.309
 detailed what to think of something special they have specially for 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.359
 this car is studying a charter 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.729
 the ode on the beautiful name concept 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:11.759
 Bugatti 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.929
 Toby o 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:17.419
 and percent the grains just look there is a leader see the clock 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.459
 Meeting dashboard 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.309
 and when they get off they can turn the clock either at or 80 degrees or 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.689
 Fun disappear or 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.979
 As you can see here they simply take the watch out of its holder 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.679
 Ben and flashing her arms 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.019
 and there she is 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.439
 very nice still very bad 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.260
 that Hartmann also tastes mulled wine then understands a bit at 60 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.199
 do not know much of Goalie where I have to return the same because of the 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.599
 Insured sum for me too expensive or water damage before the one-act 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.740
 internationally as this led his place 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.350
 the rider same opponents say we hope very much that the Libyan should 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.370
 not built as fast as possible 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.009
 I'll let him know in time and if we would 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.729
 when we talk here we talk 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.369
 very nice weak alcohol Schulte
