are<00:02:10.270> but<00:02:10.420> there's<00:02:10.600> some<00:02:10.750> nice<00:02:11.230> bearings<00:02:11.800> in

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
are but there's some nice bearings in

are but there's some nice bearings in
there<00:02:12.070> sealed<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:13.300> they<00:02:13.630> can't<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:13.990> water<00:02:14.260> no

probably<00:02:19.090> all<00:02:19.270> together<00:02:19.480> would<00:02:19.900> cost<00:02:20.110> about

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
probably all together would cost about

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.490 
probably all together would cost about
850<00:02:22.060> three<00:02:22.240> dollars<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.720> look<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.170> up<00:02:23.260> all

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
850 three dollars you can look it up all

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.920 
850 three dollars you can look it up all
the<00:02:23.620> parts<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.250> might<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.570> info

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930

the parts I might have it in the info
box<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.850> pretty<00:02:28.060> much<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.630> a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
box but that's pretty much it it's a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.620 
box but that's pretty much it it's a
really<00:02:28.989> good<00:02:29.350> bike
