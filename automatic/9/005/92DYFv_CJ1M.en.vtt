00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
left off at in a mission as far as the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
left off at in a mission as far as the
campaign<00:00:48.899> goes<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.829> thing<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
campaign goes now one thing I do want to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
campaign goes now one thing I do want to
touch<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.670> real<00:00:50.910> quickly<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.539> kind<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
touch on real quickly that I kind of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.220 
touch on real quickly that I kind of
wish<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:51.989> had<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.879> multiplayer<00:00:53.989> maybe<00:00:54.989> not

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
wish it had was a multiplayer maybe not

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
wish it had was a multiplayer maybe not
online<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> local<00:00:56.579> Wi-Fi

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
online but just a local Wi-Fi

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
online but just a local Wi-Fi
multiplayer<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
multiplayer I think would be a lot of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
multiplayer I think would be a lot of
fun<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
fun so that is the one thing that I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.670 
fun so that is the one thing that I
think<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.270> game<00:01:00.840> does<00:01:01.050> lack<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.530> than

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
think this game does lack other than

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.439 
think this game does lack other than
that<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.949> great<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.850> anyway<00:01:03.059> back<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> the

replicating<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.330> console<00:01:24.750> version<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.799> then

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
replicating the console version but then

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429 
replicating the console version but then
again<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> mobile<00:01:27.479> device<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.049> don't

again it is on a mobile device so don't

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
armor back in the day when I first

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.229 
armor back in the day when I first
bought<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.069> when<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.280> first<00:02:20.610> came<00:02:20.819> out<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.030> was

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
thought it's a lot of fun but then again

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
thought it's a lot of fun but then again
don't<00:02:25.950> expect<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.519> be<00:02:26.610> exactly<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
don't expect it to be exactly like the
