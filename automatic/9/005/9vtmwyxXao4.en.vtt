00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.960 
good it smells like Ivory soap if you
don't<00:02:27.140> want<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.800> smell<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.490> definitely

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
don't want that smell that I definitely

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.410 
don't want that smell that I definitely
probably<00:02:29.750> suggest<00:02:30.110> using<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> fellows<00:02:30.800> now

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
probably suggest using the fellows now

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.030 
probably suggest using the fellows now
the<00:02:32.420> other<00:02:32.720> thing<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.470> would<00:02:33.710> give<00:02:34.010> you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
fabric softener sheets and all you need

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.400 
fabric softener sheets and all you need
to<00:02:39.770> do<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.280> you've<00:02:40.790> whatever<00:02:41.360> kind<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:42.020> fabric

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
to do is you've whatever kind of fabric

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.430 
to do is you've whatever kind of fabric
softener<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.130> like<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:43.820> two<00:02:44.750> cups<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.380> water

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
softener you like it's two cups of water

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.570 
softener you like it's two cups of water
and<00:02:46.330> one<00:02:47.330> cup<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.500> two<00:02:49.040> parts<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
and one cup of this it's two parts to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.570 
and one cup of this it's two parts to
one<00:02:49.790> part<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:51.020> put<00:02:51.260> two<00:02:51.440> cups<00:02:51.770> in<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
one part so I put two cups in here I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.790 
one part so I put two cups in here I
think<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> actual<00:02:53.600> online<00:02:53.960> recipe<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.770> I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
think the actual online recipe that I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.070 
think the actual online recipe that I
saw<00:02:55.070> they<00:02:55.400> were<00:02:55.490> making<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:56.030> big<00:02:56.450> batches<00:02:56.930> of

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
saw they were making like big batches of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.449 
saw they were making like big batches of
it<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.410> don't<00:02:57.620> really<00:02:57.770> need<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.130> do<00:02:58.280> that

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it but I don't really need to do that

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.760 
it but I don't really need to do that
and<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.600> I'm<00:02:59.660> going<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.840> make<00:02:59.959> three<00:03:00.260> cups<00:03:00.530> of

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
and so I'm going to make three cups of

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.880 
and so I'm going to make three cups of
it<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.400> then<00:03:02.390> all<00:03:02.630> they<00:03:02.780> said<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.350> was<00:03:03.590> cut

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
it and then all they said to do was cut

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.100 
it and then all they said to do was cut
up<00:03:04.010> some<00:03:04.540> sponges<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.350> throw<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:06.950> here

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
up some sponges and you throw it in here

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.280 
up some sponges and you throw it in here
