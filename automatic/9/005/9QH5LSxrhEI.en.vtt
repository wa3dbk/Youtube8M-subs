more<00:02:05.369> thing<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.729> remember<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:07.229> were

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
more thing I remember when we were

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.660 
more thing I remember when we were
talking<00:02:07.590> about<00:02:07.680> trumpet<00:02:08.099> playing<00:02:08.310> said<00:02:08.610> you

must<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.000> reverence<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:09.929> every<00:02:10.140> note

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
must have reverence for every note

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.590 
must have reverence for every note
indeed<00:02:10.980> that's<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.820> good<00:02:11.970> thing<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.240> all<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> us

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
indeed that's a good thing for all of us

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.010 
indeed that's a good thing for all of us
to<00:02:12.660> remember<00:02:12.960> so<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.180> would<00:02:15.390> not<00:02:15.570> want<00:02:15.930> us

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020

to<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.260> sad<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.770> long<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.190> fact<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.580> think

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
to be sad for long in fact I think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.240

probably<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.330> will<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.860> some<00:02:19.860> kind<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
probably there will be some kind of a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.950 
probably there will be some kind of a
celebration<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.970> honor<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.210> his<00:02:21.450> life<00:02:21.660> before

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960
