simple<00:01:11.680> answer<00:01:11.799> to<00:01:12.009> that<00:01:12.100> because<00:01:12.400> each<00:01:12.850> Hawk

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
simple answer to that because each Hawk

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.430 
simple answer to that because each Hawk
arena<00:01:13.270> has<00:01:13.479> its<00:01:13.630> pros<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:13.810> cons<00:01:13.990> and

samples of the ocarinas you're
interested<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.629> experience<00:03:42.500> will<00:03:42.620> also<00:03:42.890> help

you know which ranges you like the most

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.210 
you know which ranges you like the most
just<00:03:45.019> remember<00:03:45.379> that<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.650> higher<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:45.860> range

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
just remember that the higher the range

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.190 
just remember that the higher the range
the<00:03:46.610> smaller<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.090> ocarina<00:03:47.450> will<00:03:47.660> be<00:03:47.750> which

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
the smaller the ocarina will be which

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.509 
the smaller the ocarina will be which
means<00:03:48.349> it'll<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:48.680> easier<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.190> carry<00:03:49.340> around

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
means it'll be easier to carry around

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.220 
means it'll be easier to carry around
and<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.420> leads<00:03:50.629> us<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.930> our<00:03:50.959> final<00:03:51.319> question

the pendant shape makes them easy to
carry<00:04:37.640> around<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:38.330> they're<00:04:39.320> usually<00:04:39.440> very

light which makes them comfortable to
wear<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:43.340> only<00:04:43.550> downside<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
wear the only downside is that the

finger combinations may take some time

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.440 
finger combinations may take some time
to<00:04:46.190> learn<00:04:46.310> but<00:04:46.850> once<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.270> them

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
to learn but once you have them

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.240 
to learn but once you have them
memorized<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:48.170> becomes<00:04:48.470> incredibly<00:04:48.740> easy<00:04:49.100> to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
memorized it becomes incredibly easy to

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.790 
master however the more popular ocarina
is<00:04:52.460> probably<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.970> transverse<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:54.470> can<00:04:54.620> have

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.810 
plus 4 it uses a linear finger pattern
which<00:05:03.320> means<00:05:03.560> as<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.860> lift<00:05:04.010> each<00:05:04.250> finger<00:05:04.610> from

which means as you lift each finger from
right<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.000> left<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.540> get<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.020> next<00:05:06.290> note<00:05:06.470> in

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
right to left you get the next note in

right to left you get the next note in
