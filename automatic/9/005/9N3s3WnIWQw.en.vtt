TCH le oh my god okay Eric why did you
do<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.290> motivation<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
do this what was the motivation in the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.100 
do this what was the motivation in the
project<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> whole<00:00:09.210> motivation<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
project the whole motivation for the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.770 
project the whole motivation for the
project<00:00:10.590> was<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> prove<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.519> process<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
project was to prove the process of the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.379 
project was to prove the process of the
the<00:00:13.349> melted<00:00:13.769> model<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.610> direct<00:00:14.910> metal<00:00:15.210> so

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the melted model the direct metal so

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.140 
the melted model the direct metal so
that<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:15.660> using<00:00:16.580> you<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.730> heard

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
that we're using you know I heard

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.090 
that we're using you know I heard
naysayers<00:00:18.630> well<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.080> doesn't<00:00:19.410> hold<00:00:19.529> tolerance

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
naysayers well it doesn't hold tolerance

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.179 
naysayers well it doesn't hold tolerance
or<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> cast<00:00:22.350> parts<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:22.800> stronger

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
or it's not a cast parts are stronger

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.250 
or it's not a cast parts are stronger
than<00:00:23.310> direct<00:00:23.640> metal<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
than direct metal and I was out to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.920 
than direct metal and I was out to
dispel<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.099> something<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:27.150> we

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
dispel that in something that I like we

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.679 
dispel that in something that I like we
we<00:00:28.590> pushing<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.160> ro7<00:00:29.519> manufacturers<00:00:30.240> license

we pushing out ro7 manufacturers license

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.709 
we pushing out ro7 manufacturers license
and<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.410> went<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> fill<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.270> lead<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and I went to fill up the the lead of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.420 
and I went to fill up the the lead of
our<00:00:33.840> medicine<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.500> said<00:00:34.680> hey<00:00:34.829> let's<00:00:35.070> build<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
our medicine I said hey let's build a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.420 
our medicine I said hey let's build a
black<00:00:35.670> barrel<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.860> let<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.250> cool

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
black barrel you know I let that cool

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.680 
black barrel you know I let that cool
off<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> couple<00:00:41.940> months<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> let's<00:00:42.510> build

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
off for a couple months and let's build

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020 
off for a couple months and let's build
a<00:00:42.780> 1911<00:00:43.500> well<00:00:43.950> sure<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> desktop<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.940> know

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
a 1911 well sure like a desktop you know

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.610 
a 1911 well sure like a desktop you know
you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.270> show<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.750> moving<00:00:46.110> parts<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you can show all the moving parts and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.279 
you can show all the moving parts and
say<00:00:46.770> no<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.280> want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> shoot<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
say no I want to shoot it it's not the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.540 
say no I want to shoot it it's not the
barrel<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.649> say<00:00:49.920> no<00:00:50.070> we're<00:00:50.280> doing<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
barrel right say no we're doing the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
barrel right say no we're doing the
barrel<00:00:50.789> -<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.110> gun<00:00:52.350> guy<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
barrel - so are you a gun guy and you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.439 
barrel - so are you a gun guy and you
seem<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.370> you're<00:00:53.670> pretty<00:00:53.879> handy<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
seem like you're pretty handy with the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.080 
seem like you're pretty handy with the
firearm<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> byproduct<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
firearm it's a byproduct it's just a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
firearm it's a byproduct it's just a
nature<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:57.930> upbringing<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.770> am<00:00:59.039> prior

operations or anything it's just an
engine<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.350> mechanicals<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.580> good<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> me

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
engine so mechanicals really good to me

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
engine so mechanicals really good to me
and<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.090> love<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> mechanics<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and I love the all the mechanics and the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
and I love the all the mechanics and the
workings<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.820> firearm<00:01:09.299> why<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
workings that go into a firearm why in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.080 
workings that go into a firearm why in
1911<00:01:10.290> why<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> clock<00:01:11.189> barrel<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.939> mean

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
1911 why not a clock barrel what I mean

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
1911 why not a clock barrel what I mean
obviously<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.689> whole<00:01:12.840> gun<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.500> part<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
obviously the whole gun is part of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.609 
obviously the whole gun is part of the
thing<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.369> why<00:01:15.030> did<00:01:15.210> did<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> choose<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
thing but why did did you choose a the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.249 
thing but why did did you choose a the
1911<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> fairly<00:01:17.490> iconic<00:01:18.150> firearm<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
1911 was a fairly iconic firearm if the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
1911 was a fairly iconic firearm if the
ticular<00:01:19.560> reason<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:21.060> you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
was a scientific and engineering and I

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.770 
was a scientific and engineering and I
was<00:02:33.600> hoping<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.080> wouldn't<00:02:34.320> go<00:02:34.620> political<00:02:35.780> to
