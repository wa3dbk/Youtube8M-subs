00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
here and you see this beautiful concept

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720 
here and you see this beautiful concept
work<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.140> stunning<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.830> I'm<00:02:23.400> really

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
work it's just stunning so I'm really

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.980 
work it's just stunning so I'm really
torn<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> good<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.480> about<00:02:24.660> most

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
torn but the good thing about most

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.780 
torn but the good thing about most
industries<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> bit<00:02:26.760> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
industries is that we have a bit of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.940 
industries is that we have a bit of
everything<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.570> concept<00:02:28.350> work<00:02:28.530> pits<00:02:28.770> in

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
everything so concept work pits in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.240 
everything so concept work pits in
animation<00:02:29.760> work<00:02:29.970> fits<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.690> design<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.920> i

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
animation work fits in and design so i

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.180 
animation work fits in and design so i
can<00:02:33.090> pick<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.450> choose<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.990> I've<00:02:34.920> been

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
a lot of them will think that their path

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.270 
a lot of them will think that their path
is<00:03:03.420> an<00:03:03.540> illustration<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.560> they<00:03:04.950> don't<00:03:05.159> look

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
