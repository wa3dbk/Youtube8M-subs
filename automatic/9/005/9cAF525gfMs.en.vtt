00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you can run on here now we have the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can run on here now we have the
ability<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> group<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.920> natural

folders<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:38.010> hold<00:00:38.640> down

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
folders and to do so we would hold down

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
folders and to do so we would hold down
on<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> items<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.590> we've<00:00:40.770> got<00:00:40.920> on

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
on one of the items that we've got on

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.709 
on one of the items that we've got on
our<00:00:41.100> screen<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.600> move

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
our screen just like we're about to move

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
our screen just like we're about to move
them<00:00:42.899> around<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:44.010> still<00:00:45.000> move

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
them around so we can we can still move

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
them around so we can we can still move
it<00:00:45.360> around<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.960> did<00:00:46.110> before<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.649> rearrange

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it around as we did before and rearrange

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459 
it around as we did before and rearrange
but<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> create<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.899> folder<00:00:49.170> we

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
but now if we want to create a folder we

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
but now if we want to create a folder we
would<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.739> drag<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.510> another

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
would actually drag one on to another

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.529 
would actually drag one on to another
and<00:00:52.079> that'll<00:00:53.010> create<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> new<00:00:53.460> folder<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.000> see

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and that'll create a new folder and see

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.080 
and that'll create a new folder and see
in<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.750> case<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.170> called<00:00:55.440> games<00:00:56.090> because

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
seems a bit strange but I guess you

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.059 
seems a bit strange but I guess you
might<00:02:16.170> want<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.409> put<00:02:16.530> something<00:02:16.769> back<00:02:16.860> in

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
might want to put something back in

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.470 
might want to put something back in
there<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.489> folder<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:17.879> disappear<00:02:18.299> once

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
there so the folder will disappear once

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.399 
there so the folder will disappear once
you<00:02:18.599> remove<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.079> last<00:02:19.319> item<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
you remove the last item out of it

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.960 
you remove the last item out of it
