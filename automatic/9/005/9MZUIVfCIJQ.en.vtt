happen here is going to be the melting

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:19.820 
happen here is going to be the melting
of<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.299> brake<00:00:06.600> line<00:00:18.080> it's<00:00:19.080> gonna<00:00:19.230> go<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.650> all

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
of the brake line it's gonna go with all

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.480 
of the brake line it's gonna go with all
of<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.010> I'm<00:00:23.130> talking

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
of that and here is what I'm talking

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.700 
of that and here is what I'm talking
about<00:00:24.859> what<00:00:25.859> needs<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.220> happen<00:00:27.349> these<00:00:28.349> front

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
about what needs to happen these front

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.540 
about what needs to happen these front
wheels<00:00:30.170> spring<00:00:31.170> obviously<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> can't<00:00:32.309> make<00:00:32.340> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
wheels spring obviously I can't make you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
wheels spring obviously I can't make you
spring<00:00:32.850> much<00:00:33.149> cuz<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.510> ain't<00:00:33.570> big<00:00:33.809> enough<00:00:33.840> but

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
spring much cuz I ain't big enough but

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.850 
spring much cuz I ain't big enough but
now<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:36.570> front<00:00:36.870> end<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.350> bounce<00:00:37.559> up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
now the front end is going to bounce up

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.510 
now the front end is going to bounce up
and<00:00:38.010> down<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.670> can't<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.440> solid<00:00:40.520> brake

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and down so you can't have a solid brake

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.930 
and down so you can't have a solid brake
line<00:00:42.440> running<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
line running out to here so what you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.150 
line running out to here so what you
have<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.510> instead<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.840> rubber<00:00:48.840> line

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
have to do instead is have a rubber line

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.569 
have to do instead is have a rubber line
that<00:00:50.160> connects<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> frame<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
that connects from here to the frame on

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.979 
that connects from here to the frame on
my<00:00:53.579> trip<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> park<00:00:54.180> store<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.660> other<00:00:54.809> day

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
my trip to the park store the other day

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.209 
my trip to the park store the other day
I<00:00:55.020> acquired<00:00:56.539> such<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.750> rubber<00:00:58.320> line<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:01.219> here

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
I acquired such a rubber line and here

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.520 
I acquired such a rubber line and here
it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.500> here's<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.860> goes<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.909> goes<00:01:05.939> up

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
it is and here's how it goes it goes up

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.070 
it is and here's how it goes it goes up
with<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> washer<00:01:08.040> underneath<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> called

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
with a washer underneath this is called

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
with a washer underneath this is called
a<00:01:10.170> banjo<00:01:10.619> bolt<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.630> through<00:01:13.790> from<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a banjo bolt that goes through from the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.370 
a banjo bolt that goes through from the
top<00:01:16.400> into<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.039 

in<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:23.229> into<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:25.270> think<00:01:26.270> that's<00:01:26.479> right<00:01:26.750> me

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
in this into that think that's right me

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.520 
in this into that think that's right me
double<00:01:27.380> check<00:01:27.409> myself<00:01:27.799> here<00:01:28.930> yeah<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.140> then

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
double check myself here yeah and then

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.740 
double check myself here yeah and then
this<00:01:30.710> will<00:01:30.890> go<00:01:31.009> like<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:35.979> this<00:01:37.630> needs<00:01:38.630> to

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
this will go like this and this needs to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.030 
this will go like this and this needs to
mount<00:01:39.020> up<00:01:39.200> over<00:01:39.500> here<00:01:39.619> on<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.830> frame

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
mount up over here on the frame

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.660 
mount up over here on the frame
somewhere<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:42.289> it<00:01:42.710> needs<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.039> do<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.490> such

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
somewhere and it needs to do so in such

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.460 
somewhere and it needs to do so in such
a<00:01:43.700> way<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:43.909> when<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.240> wheel<00:01:44.420> turns<00:01:44.780> look<00:01:45.350> how

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
a way that when the wheel turns look how

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.310 
a way that when the wheel turns look how
that<00:01:45.530> go<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.100> seeing<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.170> gonna

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
that go is seeing that this is gonna

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.680 
that go is seeing that this is gonna
have<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.710> mounted<00:01:49.659> someplace<00:01:50.659> out<00:01:51.259> here

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
have to be mounted someplace out here

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.730 
have to be mounted someplace out here
where<00:01:55.119> where<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.300> can<00:01:56.509> turn<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.440> part

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
where where that can turn and this part

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.559 
where where that can turn and this part
can<00:01:57.860> be<00:01:57.920> stable<00:01:58.580> now<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.030> bring<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.360> over<00:01:59.450> here

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
can be stable now I bring you over here

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.120 
can be stable now I bring you over here
so<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.840> can<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.110> what<00:02:00.259> I'm<00:02:00.350> doing<00:02:00.679> I'm<00:02:00.890> gonna

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
so you can see what I'm doing I'm gonna

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.350 
so you can see what I'm doing I'm gonna
go<00:02:01.220> ahead<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.429> put<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.610> shock<00:02:01.819> mounts<00:02:02.179> back

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
go ahead and put the shock mounts back

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840 
go ahead and put the shock mounts back
on<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.659> front<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:04.039> probably<00:02:04.369> set<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
on the front of it and probably set the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.080 
on the front of it and probably set the
radiator<00:02:05.270> back<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.170> place<00:02:06.440> just<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.670> give<00:02:07.909> me<00:02:08.060> a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
radiator back in place just to give me a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.669 
radiator back in place just to give me a
kind<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.509> point<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.869> reference<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.500> where

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
kind of a point of reference of where

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.699 
kind of a point of reference of where
everything<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.870> to<00:02:11.870> try<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.110> help<00:02:12.350> figure<00:02:12.650> out

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
everything is to try to help figure out

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.550 
everything is to try to help figure out
how<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.010> look<00:02:13.190> at<00:02:13.430> these<00:02:13.580> brake<00:02:13.910> lines<00:02:14.560> I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
how to look at these brake lines I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.289 
how to look at these brake lines I
probably<00:02:16.190> won't<00:02:16.370> put<00:02:16.549> these<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.910> here<00:02:17.150> were

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
probably won't put these on here were

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.140 
probably won't put these on here were
you<00:02:17.450> know<00:02:17.569> permanent<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.519> just<00:02:19.519> kind<00:02:20.120> of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you know permanent like just kind of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.479 
you know permanent like just kind of
start<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> screws<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.080> them<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.190> let<00:02:22.400> them

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
start the screws in them and let them

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.000 
start the screws in them and let them
sit<00:02:22.790> here<00:02:25.000> actually<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.239> can<00:02:26.709> use<00:02:27.709> them<00:02:27.890> to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
sit here actually I can use them to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:36.710 
sit here actually I can use them to
figure<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:28.840> how<00:02:29.840> we're<00:02:30.230> our<00:02:30.410> morning

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.870 

I<00:02:36.950> went<00:02:37.950> ahead<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.130> painted<00:02:38.340> all<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:38.640> stuff

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
I went ahead and painted all this stuff

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.820 
I went ahead and painted all this stuff
up<00:02:39.060> while<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> had<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.510> apart<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> black

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
up while I had it apart I like the black

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.060 
up while I had it apart I like the black
and<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.130> green<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.580> works<00:02:42.030> pretty<00:02:42.420> well

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
and the green it works pretty well

and<00:04:08.300> stuff<00:04:08.390> here<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:08.990> I<00:04:09.260> found<00:04:10.010> something<00:04:10.370> I

and stuff here and I I found something I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.180 
and stuff here and I I found something I
like<00:04:11.260> but<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> was<00:04:12.470> sort<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.740> hoping<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:13.040> have

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
like but I was sort of hoping to have

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.539 
like but I was sort of hoping to have
one<00:04:13.370> on<00:04:13.490> each<00:04:13.610> side<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.910> was<00:04:14.240> similar<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:15.549> I

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
one on each side that was similar and I

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.039 
one on each side that was similar and I
went<00:04:16.940> down<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.180> see<00:04:17.299> my<00:04:17.330> neighbor<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.840> he<00:04:17.930> had

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
went down to see my neighbor and he had

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.229 
went down to see my neighbor and he had
a<00:04:18.080> couple<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.470> these<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:19.700> he<00:04:19.820> left<00:04:19.940> me<00:04:20.090> half

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
a couple of these that he left me half

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.280 
a couple of these that he left me half
for<00:04:20.480> a<00:04:20.540> buck<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:23.000> pretty<00:04:23.300> much<00:04:23.390> does<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
for a buck so that pretty much does the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.570 
for a buck so that pretty much does the
trick<00:04:24.500> right<00:04:24.710> there<00:04:25.070> uh<00:04:25.450> what<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:26.630> gonna<00:04:26.870> work

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
trick right there uh what is gonna work

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.360 
trick right there uh what is gonna work
is<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:29.030> uh<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:30.500> know<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> brake<00:04:30.860> line<00:04:31.100> goes

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
is that uh you know the brake line goes

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.040 
is that uh you know the brake line goes
to<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:33.010> you<00:04:34.010> can<00:04:34.190> turn<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.550> wheel<00:04:35.050> either

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
to that you can turn the wheel either

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.800 
to that you can turn the wheel either
way<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.740> it's<00:04:37.280> stable<00:04:37.580> right<00:04:37.970> there<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.540> can

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
way and it's stable right there I can

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.500 
way and it's stable right there I can
come<00:04:39.020> out<00:04:39.200> of<00:04:39.230> here<00:04:39.740> over<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.970> frame<00:04:41.240> and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
come out of here over to the frame and

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.060 
come out of here over to the frame and
and<00:04:42.430> probably<00:04:43.430> run<00:04:44.380> inside<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.440> frame<00:04:45.860> then

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
and probably run inside the frame then

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.040 
and probably run inside the frame then
underneath<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.760> go<00:04:46.970> down<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.330> inside<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.900> the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
underneath and go down the inside of the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.390 
underneath and go down the inside of the
frame<00:04:48.230> there<00:04:48.470> with<00:04:48.620> my<00:04:48.770> brake<00:04:48.980> line<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
frame there with my brake line and

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.440 
frame there with my brake line and
that'll<00:04:52.400> be<00:04:52.490> fine

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
that'll be fine

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.540 
that'll be fine
I<00:04:53.480> don't<00:04:53.930> see<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.200> problem<00:04:54.320> with<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:55.040> it

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
I don't see the problem with that it

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.830 
I don't see the problem with that it
seems<00:04:55.760> like<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.030> does<00:04:56.300> everything<00:04:56.600> it's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
seems like it does everything it's

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.640 
seems like it does everything it's
supposed<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.230> do<00:04:57.410> right<00:04:57.620> there<00:04:58.210> so<00:04:59.380> I'm<00:05:00.380> happy

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
supposed to do right there so I'm happy

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.850 
supposed to do right there so I'm happy
with<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.920> so<00:05:01.780> there<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.840> go<00:05:02.990> piece<00:05:03.590> of<00:05:03.620> cake

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
with it so there you go piece of cake

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.280 
with it so there you go piece of cake
once<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.280> get<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.520> figured<00:05:04.640> out<00:05:05.020> I'll<00:05:06.020> show

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
once you get it figured out I'll show

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.250 
once you get it figured out I'll show
you<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.500> other<00:05:06.680> side<00:05:06.950> it's<00:05:07.340> almost<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.850> same

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
you the other side it's almost the same

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.730 
you the other side it's almost the same
basically<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.480> wrench<00:05:11.480> five<00:05:12.470> eighths

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
basically this is a wrench five eighths

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.290 
basically this is a wrench five eighths
on<00:05:12.920> one<00:05:13.130> end<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:13.520> an<00:05:13.640> old-fashioned<00:05:14.180> right

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
on one end it's an old-fashioned right

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.170 
on one end it's an old-fashioned right
for<00:05:14.480> the<00:05:14.570> big<00:05:14.720> hit<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.290> and<00:05:15.500> it's<00:05:15.680> uh<00:05:16.180> it's

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
for the big hit on it and it's uh it's

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.600 
for the big hit on it and it's uh it's
got<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.690> Box<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.380> on<00:05:18.560> either<00:05:18.710> side<00:05:19.040> so<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.370> just

mounted one in right to the shock mount
and<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.590> other<00:05:21.740> end<00:05:22.010> through<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.880> brake<00:05:23.120> line

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
and the other end through the brake line

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.610
