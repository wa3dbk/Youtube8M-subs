00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.230
 today we have all the machines to 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.809
 our disposition and everything that 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.969
 spectacular with the marbles how many 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.280

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.269
 Today we will connect to the canvas we 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.550
 to register although it is the platform of 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.920
 world brother design that will give what 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 what is caracas that you can also choose 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.689
 a lot of designs to do if the 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.720
 low that now we will see later 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.239
 how and after the sleeves to the marbles 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.059
 and shorten them but see what beauty 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.010
 these faithful boxes and to show you 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.660
 of that because they have cut and die cut 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.430
 then when they see german they have 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.110
 action now let's see another function 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.090
 that we had not seen not also this 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.960
 fascinates of look at florists throughout 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:54.040
 cut and this would be the mold well 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.440
 the die-cut good this is 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.800
 not to say fashionable but the people 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.990
 you are needing it as a work release 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.270
 to give to teach the wta that is 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.550
 wonderful so it helps simplify 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.510
 something that is used as much as candy bar and 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.120
 the rest 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.400

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.970
 and I remove the pendrive and we go to the 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:53.030
 perfect machine well and after 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.990
 place the chosen paper in the sea what 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.990
 located on the machine 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.620
 I charge it then now we go to the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.350
 screen we choose the pattern option 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.190

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.180
 saved I choose instead of what 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.400
 we always choose what is the memory of the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.739
 machine I choose the pendrive 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.959
 there you are recovering 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.870
 and here I will have all the projects 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.120
 that I have loaded and I choose the one that I'm going to 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.789
 Now be to cut once 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.490
 identified the pattern that I'm going to cut 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:33.129
 I click here we have it 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.589
 I will see what there is 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.919
 can I scan here gives me the option to 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:37.919
 scanning 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:48.190
 to verify that the paper is 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.350
 correctly placed well I already have it 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.790
 everything is fine I'm going to slide it a 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.860
 little bit to the right ready ok now yes 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.210
 I 'm going to tell you what to cut though what 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.180
 I will be telling the machine 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.450
 is that cut that starts and also 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.940
 to die to make the die 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.480
 will help to be able to double our 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.480
 small boxes 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:32.639
 and it's OK 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.639
 now let's see wonderful all 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.000
 of seeded grace 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.759
 we have here that a flower was left behind 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.550
 form negative appointments and now if the 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.410
 box in a little while you can make boxes 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.120
 of these to give away that is 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.370
 impressive are papers for 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.650
 scrapbooking as in this case the 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:57.580
 organize then our cardboard look 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.580
 in the die we support a rule 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.250
 and with some spatula we can help 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.020
 or not not so essential and we are going to 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.340
 breaking that 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:12.370
 then the brand is perfect after 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.069
 that we mark all what we do is 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.770
 join these flaps we are going to put 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:21.430
 adhesive to this flap is already for 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:25.030
 close it and then we put the sticker on 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.210
 this game that would close all the 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.479
 wonder are the armed card 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:35.099
 we broke down one by one and you have left 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.099
 so if you pick it up it's already 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.400
 it's wonderful you can put candies 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:46.030
 Little things little things surprise is free 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.270
 if it seems incredible, not the possibility 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.660
 to have a space yes inside bradl 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.320
 to have everything, let's say for free 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.199
 amount of week they leave 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.479
 adding without how many there will be thousands and there 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:06.699
 very many is difficult to choose sometimes 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:08.500
 to choose not because suddenly you have to 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.440
 make for souvenirs has to be for 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.300
 birthday or on fabric or they ask you 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.669
 different materials different nails 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.949
