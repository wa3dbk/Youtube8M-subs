was made and a couple of months ago to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.769 
was made and a couple of months ago to
assist<00:00:19.830> me<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
assist me and I use this because if I

assist me and I use this because if I
was<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> show<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> real<00:00:23.010> person

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
was to show you this in a real person

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.759 
was to show you this in a real person
you're<00:00:24.300> never<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:25.019> exactly<00:00:25.470> what

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you're never going to see exactly what

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.900 
you're never going to see exactly what
I'm<00:00:25.859> doing<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.250> I'm<00:00:26.310> obviously<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> enlarge

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
I'm doing so I'm obviously if I enlarge

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
I'm doing so I'm obviously if I enlarge
it<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> use<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:27.930> props<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.470> it's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it with the use of these props and it's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.669 
it with the use of these props and it's
going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.800> help<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.220> realize<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.529> what<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
going to help you realize and what the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
going to help you realize and what the
technique<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.640> need<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
technique is that you need to use to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.110 
technique is that you need to use to
make<00:00:33.660> sure<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> properly<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
make sure that you get it properly I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
make sure that you get it properly I
suppose<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> lot<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.770> complaining

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
suppose so a lot of you are complaining

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.330 
suppose so a lot of you are complaining
that<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.579> basis<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> extension

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that your basis so this is the extension

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
that your basis so this is the extension
even<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> natural<00:00:41.760> lashes<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.719> bases<00:00:43.260> are

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
even the natural lashes your bases are

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
even the natural lashes your bases are
not<00:00:43.620> attached<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> you're<00:00:44.399> struggling<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
not attached and you're struggling to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.200 
not attached and you're struggling to
get<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.050> lash<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> natural<00:00:47.879> lash<00:00:48.059> at

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
get the lash on to the natural lash at

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
get the lash on to the natural lash at
the<00:00:48.300> correct<00:00:48.539> angle<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the correct angle and this is how you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.729 
the correct angle and this is how you
need<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.090> start<00:00:51.750> training<00:00:52.079> yourself<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
need to start training yourself to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
need to start training yourself to
recognize<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.489> type<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> natural<00:00:54.210> lash<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
recognize the type of natural lash that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.450 
recognize the type of natural lash that
you've<00:00:54.600> got<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.930> front<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.309> way

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you've got in front of you and the way

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.760 
you've got in front of you and the way
in<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.870> hand<00:00:58.289> angle<00:00:58.410> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
in which you just your hand angle to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
in which you just your hand angle to
suit<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.090> which<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> attach<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
suit the way in which you attach the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
suit the way in which you attach the
extension<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.550> fingers<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.149> actually

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
extension so my fingers are actually

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.660 
extension so my fingers are actually
going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> represent<00:01:03.840> my<00:01:04.229> tweezers<00:01:04.920> holding

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
going to represent my tweezers holding

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to to learn how to assess the lash

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.870 
to to learn how to assess the lash
you've<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.220> front<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.610> adjust

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you've got in front of you and adjust

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.580 
you've got in front of you and adjust
your<00:01:24.030> angle<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.630> example<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> need

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
your angle so for example what we need

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
your angle so for example what we need
to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> focusing<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.720> come<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to be focusing on is when we come in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.160 
to be focusing on is when we come in
with<00:01:28.380> our<00:01:28.579> extension<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.659> match<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
with our extension we have to match the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.929 
with our extension we have to match the
angle<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> natural<00:01:32.189> lash<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.549> sitting

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
angle that the natural lash is sitting

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.910 
angle that the natural lash is sitting
there<00:01:33.090> okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.229> lash<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.650> actually

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
there okay so if this lash was actually

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
there okay so if this lash was actually
to<00:01:35.009> sit<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.340> straight<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.270> come

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to sit out straight like this if we come

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.440 
to sit out straight like this if we come
in<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> isn't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in like this we can see that this isn't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
in like this we can see that this isn't
better<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:39.990> okay<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.130> got

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
better work okay because we now have got

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
better work okay because we now have got
such<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> minimal<00:01:42.060> contact<00:01:42.509> point<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
such a minimal contact point on the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
such a minimal contact point on the
bottom<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> isn't<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> work<00:01:44.790> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
bottom that it isn't going to work I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.780 
bottom that it isn't going to work I
also<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.990> people<00:01:46.170> come<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.340> their<00:01:47.399> hand

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
also see people come in with their hand

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
also see people come in with their hand
angle<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.899> they're<00:01:49.049> trying<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
angle like this so they're trying to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.060 
angle like this so they're trying to
come<00:01:50.130> underneath<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> lashes<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.920> again<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
come underneath the lashes and again you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.370 
come underneath the lashes and again you
can<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.759> isn't<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.270> work<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
can see that this isn't gonna work if I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.959 
can see that this isn't gonna work if I
was<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.680> come<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.189> hand<00:01:56.399> angle<00:01:56.820> like

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
was to come in with my hand angle like

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.080 
was to come in with my hand angle like
this<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> actually<00:01:59.460> pretty<00:01:59.549> perfect

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
this this is actually pretty perfect

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.639 
this this is actually pretty perfect
because<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.930> laid<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.200> top

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because it's kind of just laid on top

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.280 
because it's kind of just laid on top
however<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.149> need<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> make<00:02:03.659> sure<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
however what we need to make sure is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.510 
however what we need to make sure is
that<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> base<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> extension<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
that the base of the extension is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.820 
that the base of the extension is
attached<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.179> base<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> natural<00:02:10.020> lash

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
attached to the base of the natural lash

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.550 
attached to the base of the natural lash
this<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> bonding<00:02:11.880> area<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.080> need<00:02:13.350> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
this is the bonding area that we need to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
this is the bonding area that we need to
make<00:02:13.740> sure<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.280> attached<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.730> don't<00:02:14.910> care<00:02:15.210> what

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
make sure is attached we don't care what

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.260 
make sure is attached we don't care what
this<00:02:15.570> fit<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.900> doing<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.560> okay<00:02:17.550> as<00:02:17.970> long<00:02:18.210> as

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
this fit is doing here okay as long as

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.930 
this fit is doing here okay as long as
this<00:02:18.480> bit<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.020> anchored<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.730> going

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
this bit here is anchored that is going

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.160 
this bit here is anchored that is going
to<00:02:21.000> mean<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> our<00:02:21.390> pretension<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:21.990> going<00:02:22.110> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
to mean that our pretension is going to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
to mean that our pretension is going to
be<00:02:22.260> absolutely<00:02:22.650> fine<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> sometimes

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
be absolutely fine what you sometimes

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
be absolutely fine what you sometimes
find<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:24.870> people<00:02:25.200> come<00:02:25.380> at<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> wrong

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
find that if people come at the wrong

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.280 
find that if people come at the wrong
angle<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.550> coming<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:27.540> their<00:02:27.720> extension

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
angle and coming in with their extension

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.420 
angle and coming in with their extension
like<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.740> they<00:02:29.550> place<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.210> middle<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
like this they place in the middle and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.770 
like this they place in the middle and
then<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.460> looks<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.270> attached<00:02:33.600> but

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
then it looks like it's attached but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.420 
then it looks like it's attached but
actually<00:02:34.230> you've<00:02:34.410> probably<00:02:34.680> got<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.100> tiny

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
actually you've probably got a tiny

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.700 
actually you've probably got a tiny
little<00:02:35.670> gap<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> base<00:02:36.510> here<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.590> is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
little gap on the base here but there is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.410 
little gap on the base here but there is
no<00:02:37.890> attachment<00:02:38.460> within<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.820> couple<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.240> days

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
no attachment within a couple of days

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.480 
no attachment within a couple of days
these<00:02:40.170> bases<00:02:40.650> will<00:02:40.770> start<00:02:41.070> coming<00:02:41.370> unstuck

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
these bases will start coming unstuck

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.460 
these bases will start coming unstuck
completely<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.360> whole<00:02:42.540> lash<00:02:42.840> will<00:02:43.230> come

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
completely and the whole lash will come

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.560 
completely and the whole lash will come
off<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:44.430> resin<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:44.910> important<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
off this resin is important that you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.850 
off this resin is important that you
make<00:02:45.750> sure<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.020> your<00:02:46.140> blue<00:02:46.350> dippin<00:02:46.770> is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
make sure that your blue dippin is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.140 
make sure that your blue dippin is
correct<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.460> only<00:02:47.580> want<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.820> be<00:02:47.940> dipping

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
correct so we only want to be dipping

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.750 
correct so we only want to be dipping
sort<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> about<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:50.130> third<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.640> way

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
sort of up to about the third of the way

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
sort of up to about the third of the way
up<00:02:50.910> maximum<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:52.170> run<00:02:52.410> our<00:02:52.560> blue<00:02:52.800> all<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
up maximum if we run our blue all the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980 
up maximum if we run our blue all the
way<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> top<00:02:53.670> up<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> top<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.480> law

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
way up the top up to the top of this law

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.930 
way up the top up to the top of this law
just<00:02:55.290> above<00:02:55.500> half<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:55.920> my<00:02:56.040> lash<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.520> happens

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
just above half my my lash what happens

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.120 
just above half my my lash what happens
when<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> go<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> place<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> lash<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
when you go to place the lash on is the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.570 
when you go to place the lash on is the
middle<00:02:59.520> we'll<00:02:59.730> grab<00:03:00.120> first<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.580> then

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
middle we'll grab first of all and then

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.310 
middle we'll grab first of all and then
the<00:03:02.940> end<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.450> or<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.660> base<00:03:03.870> will<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
the end of it or the base will be the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.190 
the end of it or the base will be the
last<00:03:04.530> attach<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.510> actually<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:06.959> now

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
last attach and actually this is now

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.260 
last attach and actually this is now
started<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.770> dry<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.550> when<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.850> looks<00:03:09.150> like

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
started to dry so when it looks like

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.880 
started to dry so when it looks like
it's<00:03:09.420> bonded<00:03:09.930> actually<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.530> dry<00:03:10.860> glue

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's bonded actually this is dry glue

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.040 
it's bonded actually this is dry glue
here<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.940> has<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> bonded<00:03:12.540> properly<00:03:12.900> you've

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
here that has a bonded properly you've

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.050 
here that has a bonded properly you've
got<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> great<00:03:13.470> bond<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> middle<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
got a great bond in the middle but a

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.600 
got a great bond in the middle but a
very<00:03:15.300> very<00:03:15.510> poor<00:03:15.750> bond<00:03:16.110> at<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.290> base<00:03:16.620> so

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
very very poor bond at the base so

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.710 
very very poor bond at the base so
actually<00:03:17.880> that's<00:03:18.150> not<00:03:18.209> going<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.600> good

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
actually that's not going to be good

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.800 
actually that's not going to be good
retention<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:20.070> all<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.459> need<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.850> focus<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.510> is

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
retention so all you need to focus on is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.290 
retention so all you need to focus on is
that<00:03:21.989> your<00:03:22.170> hand<00:03:22.560> with<00:03:23.190> your<00:03:23.220> tweezers<00:03:23.640> coming

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
that your hand with your tweezers coming

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.940 
that your hand with your tweezers coming
up<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> correct<00:03:24.810> angle<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.380> match<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
up the correct angle to match the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.910 
up the correct angle to match the
natural<00:03:26.370> lash<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:27.050> that<00:03:28.050> you're<00:03:28.200> laying<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
natural lash and that you're laying the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.610 
natural lash and that you're laying the
based<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.730> contrail<00:03:30.360> get<00:03:30.630> loaded<00:03:30.870> bases<00:03:31.470> on

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
based on so contrail get loaded bases on

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.040 
based on so contrail get loaded bases on
first<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.220> all<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.760> then<00:03:33.390> actually<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> rest

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
first of all and then actually the rest

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.860 
first of all and then actually the rest
of<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> lash<00:03:34.560> will<00:03:34.890> follow<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.209> don't<00:03:36.570> get

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
of the lash will follow if you don't get

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.430 
of the lash will follow if you don't get
that<00:03:37.080> base<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.940> won't<00:03:39.239> work<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.290> also

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
that base on it won't work this is also

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.600 
that base on it won't work this is also
important<00:03:40.920> where<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.160> need<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> have<00:03:41.459> your

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
important where you need to have your

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.460 
important where you need to have your
glue<00:03:41.880> dipping<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:42.780> correct<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:43.170> you've<00:03:43.290> got

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
glue dipping just correct so you've got

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.000 
glue dipping just correct so you've got
exactly<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.160> right<00:03:44.430> amount<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.940> glue<00:03:45.300> on<00:03:45.630> your

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
exactly the right amount of glue on your

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.800 
exactly the right amount of glue on your
extension<00:03:47.010> when<00:03:47.550> you<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.000> properly<00:03:48.300> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
extension when you do this properly and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.960 
extension when you do this properly and
you<00:03:48.989> go<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> put<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.980> natural<00:03:50.280> lash<00:03:50.670> or<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
you go to put the natural lash or the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.400 
you go to put the natural lash or the
extension<00:03:51.209> onto<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.480> natural<00:03:51.600> lash<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.260> will

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
extension onto the natural lash it will

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.960 
extension onto the natural lash it will
actually<00:03:52.500> just<00:03:52.800> grab<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.310> suck<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.850> it's

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
actually just grab and suck it in it's

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.729 
actually just grab and suck it in it's
almost<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.360> magnet<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:55.560> not

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
almost like a magnet and it's not

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:56.960 
almost like a magnet and it's not
something<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.190> train<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:56.850> it

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
something that I can train you to do it

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.310 
something that I can train you to do it
some<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.600> do<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.840> yourself<00:03:58.170> and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
some of you have to do it yourself and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.020 
some of you have to do it yourself and
then<00:03:58.380> suddenly<00:03:58.620> realize<00:03:59.040> app<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.640> is<00:03:59.790> how<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
then suddenly realize app that is how it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.970 
then suddenly realize app that is how it
was<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.870> get<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.320> amount<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.650> glue<00:04:01.800> on

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
was you get the right amount of glue on

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.949 
was you get the right amount of glue on
there<00:04:02.220> coming<00:04:02.820> at<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.000> right<00:04:03.150> angle

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
there coming at the right angle

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.740 
there coming at the right angle
placing<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.920> base<00:04:05.070> first<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:06.150> will<00:04:06.330> just

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
placing the base first and it will just

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.930 
placing the base first and it will just
grab<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.590> pull<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.890> on<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.489> means<00:04:08.790> that

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
grab and pull it on and that means that

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.210 
grab and pull it on and that means that
you're<00:04:09.120> not<00:04:09.150> doing<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> work<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.769> many<00:04:10.950> times

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
you're not doing the work so many times

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.100 
you're not doing the work so many times
I<00:04:11.430> see<00:04:11.640> sort<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.940> ladies<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.600> my<00:04:12.690> courses

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
I see sort of ladies on my courses

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.800 
I see sort of ladies on my courses
they're<00:04:13.739> forced<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.430> lashon<00:04:14.970> or<00:04:15.570> they're

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
they're forced in the lashon or they're

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.610 
they're forced in the lashon or they're
sort<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.109> working<00:04:16.470> with<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.709> way<00:04:16.859> what's<00:04:17.070> left

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
sort of working with the way what's left

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.009 
sort of working with the way what's left
snap<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.459> on<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.579> natural<00:04:18.970> ash<00:04:19.090> actually<00:04:19.810> now

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
snap it on the natural ash actually now

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.439 
snap it on the natural ash actually now
the<00:04:20.290> glue<00:04:20.829> will<00:04:21.100> do<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> work<00:04:21.579> for<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:22.180> if

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
the glue will do the work for you so if

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.909 
the glue will do the work for you so if
you<00:04:22.540> actually<00:04:22.690> just<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.050> hover<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.620> near

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
you actually just up hover it near

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.210 
you actually just up hover it near
within<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.400> correct<00:04:25.210> position<00:04:26.070> then<00:04:27.070> you'll

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
within the correct position then you'll

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.670 
within the correct position then you'll
find<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:28.090> actually<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.630> will<00:04:28.810> just<00:04:29.260> pull

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
find that actually it will just pull

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.290 
find that actually it will just pull
itself<00:04:30.070> on<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:30.970> just<00:04:31.180> let

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
itself on to that and you can just let

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.760 
itself on to that and you can just let
go<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.810> will<00:04:31.900> actually<00:04:31.990> suck<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.590> on<00:04:32.650> in

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
go and it will actually suck it on in

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.770 
go and it will actually suck it on in
the<00:04:32.830> direction<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.460> want<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.940> go<00:04:34.120> so

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
the direction that you want it to go so

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.200 
the direction that you want it to go so
start<00:04:35.169> training<00:04:35.560> ourselves<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:36.160> learn<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
start training ourselves to learn the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.629 
start training ourselves to learn the
correct<00:04:37.540> position<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:38.800> have<00:04:38.949> your<00:04:39.100> hand<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.550> so

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
correct position to have your hand in so

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.890 
correct position to have your hand in so
it<00:04:39.760> might<00:04:39.910> be<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.090> case<00:04:40.330> if<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:40.570> needed<00:04:40.780> to

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
it might be a case if you needed to

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.379 
it might be a case if you needed to
bring<00:04:41.169> your<00:04:41.320> hand<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.620> wash<00:04:41.949> you<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:43.030> suit<00:04:43.240> the

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
bring your hand to wash you to suit the

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.450 
bring your hand to wash you to suit the
natural<00:04:43.780> lash<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.530> might<00:04:44.740> be<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:44.919> case<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.220> if

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
natural lash it might be a case that if

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.189 
natural lash it might be a case that if
you've<00:04:45.580> got<00:04:45.760> very<00:04:45.790> very<00:04:46.180> flat<00:04:46.570> lash<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.960> sit

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
you've got very very flat lash you sit

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.840 
you've got very very flat lash you sit
on<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.350> pad<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:48.070> need<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.310> turn<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.550> hand

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
on the pad you need to turn the hand

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.930 
on the pad you need to turn the hand
angle<00:04:49.330> like<00:04:49.930> that<00:04:49.960> just<00:04:50.800> be<00:04:50.979> mindful<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.729> if

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
angle like that just be mindful that if

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.850 
angle like that just be mindful that if
you<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.720> can<00:04:52.900> see<00:04:53.110> what<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.410> base<00:04:53.620> of

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
you do that you can see what the base of

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.469 
you do that you can see what the base of
the<00:04:53.949> natural<00:04:54.310> lashes<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.910> extensions<00:04:55.330> do

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
the natural lashes of the extensions do

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.450 
the natural lashes of the extensions do
is<00:04:55.630> pointing<00:04:56.050> up<00:04:56.169> towards<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.560> air<00:04:56.710> so<00:04:57.310> you're

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
is pointing up towards the air so you're

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.900 
is pointing up towards the air so you're
going<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:57.729> risk<00:04:58.440> leaving<00:04:59.440> this<00:04:59.919> base<00:05:00.250> expose

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
going to risk leaving this base expose

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
going to risk leaving this base expose
so<00:05:01.570> if<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.750> turn<00:05:01.810> in<00:05:02.260> your<00:05:02.410> hand<00:05:02.620> slightly

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
so if I turn in your hand slightly

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.420 
so if I turn in your hand slightly
you're<00:05:04.930> just<00:05:05.110> going<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.320> come<00:05:05.500> in<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.979> place

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
you're just going to come in and place

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.180 
you're just going to come in and place
it<00:05:06.639> down<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.479> there<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.229> an<00:05:08.320> analogy<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:08.830> used

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
it down and there is an analogy I used

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.890 
it down and there is an analogy I used
someplace<00:05:09.580> students<00:05:10.120> which<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.449> kind<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.720> made

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
someplace students which I kind of made

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.629 
someplace students which I kind of made
up<00:05:11.050> because<00:05:11.139> I<00:05:11.260> thought<00:05:11.830> try<00:05:12.039> and<00:05:12.160> make<00:05:12.310> people

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
up because I thought try and make people

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.550 
up because I thought try and make people
with<00:05:12.760> us<00:05:12.850> how<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:13.180> got<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.330> go<00:05:13.479> on<00:05:13.660> imagine

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
with us how it's got to go on imagine

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.400 
with us how it's got to go on imagine
that<00:05:14.800> your<00:05:15.100> natural<00:05:15.910> lash<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.360> an<00:05:16.479> egg<00:05:16.780> okay<00:05:17.260> is

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
that your natural lash is an egg okay is

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.710 
that your natural lash is an egg okay is
so<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:17.979> delicate<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:18.580> don't<00:05:18.729> want<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:19.000> crush<00:05:19.690> it

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
so so delicate we don't want to crush it

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.839 
so so delicate we don't want to crush it
we<00:05:20.530> just<00:05:20.740> want<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:20.949> touch<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.220> gently<00:05:21.490> and

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
we just want to touch it gently and

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.600 
we just want to touch it gently and
imagine<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.630> your<00:05:22.810> own<00:05:23.400> extension<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.580> a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
imagine that your own extension is a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.300 
imagine that your own extension is a
helicopter<00:05:25.450> okay<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:26.020> helicopters<00:05:26.919> have<00:05:27.130> to

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
helicopter okay and helicopters have to

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.120 
helicopter okay and helicopters have to
land<00:05:27.550> at<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.000> perfect<00:05:28.270> angle<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:29.410> order<00:05:29.830> to

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
land at the perfect angle in order to

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.589 
land at the perfect angle in order to
land<00:05:30.310> on<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.610> ground<00:05:30.729> properly<00:05:31.060> if<00:05:31.270> they<00:05:31.389> land

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
land on the ground properly if they land

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.930 
land on the ground properly if they land
their<00:05:31.900> tail<00:05:32.169> down<00:05:32.560> with<00:05:33.220> their<00:05:33.400> nose<00:05:33.580> down

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
their tail down with their nose down

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.969 
their tail down with their nose down
then<00:05:34.240> they're<00:05:34.360> going<00:05:34.479> to<00:05:34.539> crash<00:05:34.870> okay<00:05:35.289> but<00:05:35.919> in

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
then they're going to crash okay but in

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.800 
then they're going to crash okay but in
order<00:05:36.220> to<00:05:36.250> load<00:05:36.520> our<00:05:36.729> helicopter<00:05:37.360> on<00:05:37.479> our<00:05:37.630> egg

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
order to load our helicopter on our egg

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.000 
order to load our helicopter on our egg
we've<00:05:38.020> got<00:05:38.229> to<00:05:38.320> come<00:05:38.530> down

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
we've got to come down

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.710 
we've got to come down
absolute<00:05:39.760> perfection<00:05:40.090> and<00:05:40.450> we've<00:05:40.570> actually

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
absolute perfection and we've actually

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.839 
absolute perfection and we've actually
just<00:05:40.900> got<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.530> touch<00:05:41.770> gently<00:05:42.099> we<00:05:42.490> come<00:05:42.700> down

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
just got to touch gently we come down

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.219 
just got to touch gently we come down
too<00:05:43.060> quick<00:05:43.389> we're<00:05:43.630> going<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.840> watch<00:05:44.020> the

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
too quick we're going to watch the

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.230 
too quick we're going to watch the
natural<00:05:44.560> lash<00:05:44.680> out<00:05:44.830> of<00:05:44.979> the<00:05:45.039> way<00:05:45.190> if<00:05:45.550> we<00:05:46.030> come

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
natural lash out of the way if we come

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.580 
natural lash out of the way if we come
down<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.449> you<00:05:46.660> stop<00:05:46.870> flee<00:05:47.139> obviously<00:05:47.470> we're

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
down to you stop flee obviously we're

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.719 
down to you stop flee obviously we're
not<00:05:47.680> going<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.860> make<00:05:48.010> any<00:05:48.190> contact<00:05:48.370> with<00:05:48.639> the

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
not going to make any contact with the

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.990 
not going to make any contact with the
egg<00:05:48.849> but<00:05:49.389> land<00:05:49.660> that<00:05:49.840> helicopter<00:05:51.000> completely

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
egg but land that helicopter completely

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.629 
egg but land that helicopter completely
in<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.210> right<00:05:52.389> position<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.320> allow<00:05:53.919> gently<00:05:54.520> on

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
in the right position to allow gently on

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.480 
in the right position to allow gently on
the<00:05:54.789> egg<00:05:54.910> and<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.240> is<00:05:55.449> the<00:05:55.570> pressure<00:05:55.840> and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
the egg and that is the pressure and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.070 
the egg and that is the pressure and
then<00:05:57.490> everything<00:05:58.060> will<00:05:58.210> do<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.479> work<00:05:58.630> for<00:05:58.960> you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
then everything will do the work for you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.810 
then everything will do the work for you
you<00:05:59.470> probably<00:05:59.650> think<00:05:59.949> I'm<00:06:00.070> completely<00:06:00.250> mad

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
you probably think I'm completely mad

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.060 
you probably think I'm completely mad
but<00:06:01.300> it<00:06:01.780> kind<00:06:02.020> of<00:06:02.110> seems<00:06:02.320> to<00:06:02.410> work<00:06:02.650> with<00:06:02.860> my

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
but it kind of seems to work with my

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.700 
but it kind of seems to work with my
Milady's<00:06:03.729> that<00:06:03.849> come<00:06:04.000> on<00:06:04.090> my<00:06:04.180> courses<00:06:04.690> so<00:06:05.260> give

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
Milady's that come on my courses so give

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.680 
Milady's that come on my courses so give
that<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:05.949> go<00:06:06.250> just<00:06:06.699> remember<00:06:07.090> about<00:06:07.150> your<00:06:07.360> hand

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
that a go just remember about your hand

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.960 
that a go just remember about your hand
angles<00:06:08.260> and<00:06:08.530> learning<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.490> assess<00:06:09.789> the

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
angles and learning to assess the

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.370 
angles and learning to assess the
natural<00:06:10.330> lash<00:06:10.510> that<00:06:10.539> you've<00:06:10.780> got<00:06:10.930> in<00:06:11.050> front<00:06:11.260> of

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
natural lash that you've got in front of

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.219 
natural lash that you've got in front of
you<00:06:11.500> as<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:12.160> how<00:06:12.340> you<00:06:12.400> make<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:12.910> placement

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
you as to how you make the placement

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.629 
you as to how you make the placement
onto<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.289> natural<00:06:14.620> lash<00:06:14.800> just<00:06:15.039> making<00:06:15.460> sure

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
onto the natural lash just making sure

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.939 
onto the natural lash just making sure
that<00:06:15.789> always<00:06:16.360> it<00:06:17.020> is<00:06:17.080> your<00:06:17.380> base<00:06:17.620> that<00:06:17.860> is

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
that always it is your base that is
