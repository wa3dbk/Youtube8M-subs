00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.280
 hello this video is a 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.260
 with a new version of the other video that 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.940
 had done on the piles that was 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.220
 very tiny and my voice was very shrill 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.140
 Y 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.220
 after music how to allow these 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.220
 shameful they had 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.200
 but good the point is that I want 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.530
 explain the video better because there are people 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.150
 what 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.990
 between herself she has to explain 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.850
 how do i do it 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.010
 although for me the bid is very descriptive 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.080
 but I want to do it for you 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.040
 or that since we have the battery brings the 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.040
 battery case 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.200
 to see focuses on the battery box 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.800
 the domain spaces 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.450
 and the aluminum and the two batteries good 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520
 to make these pieces of aluminum 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.250
 you have to bend the aluminum until 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.050
 that they do as the plates as 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 this flight good the straws have to 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.650
 stay perfectly here 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.590
 here on the top 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.470
 Well the first step is going to be to put 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.880
 stacks in this way positive pole 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.439
 down 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.439
 with the positive above 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.409
 yes 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.409
 and the trÃ³n 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.770
 and we put a small insert 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.310
 here between these two so well fits and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.650
 if you do not give them with depression they can put 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.490
 others 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.000
 and what you have to do is give pressure 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.760
 for example depression 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.070
 that bit can be put here but the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.500
 truth I feel pretty useless and what 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.300
 I put in the other video because so that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.720
 let's put pressure on actually with 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.720
 this enough 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.120
 the pile the pile and the adhesive tape is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.050
 optional can be put that way 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.910
 so that the batteries do not fall 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.380
 if I recommend it but I'm not going to 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.810
 know in our thing because right now 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.040
 I'm playing the truth you have it like that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.850
 then the problem look what I have 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.100
 down on the problem 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.580
 good to show that it works 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.200
 and we are going to turn on the control 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.200
 how they look works perfectly 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.450
 vibrates does everything a control does 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.530
 freedom is to explain why 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.530
 here too 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.689
 and the batteries 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.730
 good 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 the aluminum does some do not know it is 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.959
 a conductive material 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.750
 conducts electricity 10 something is used in 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.540
 devices as driver as caps 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.030
 etcetera commercial aluminum that is 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.970
 used to wrap food or for other 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.290
 things is like a plate 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.069
 here in the box there are sheets of any 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.140
 metal can be copper zinc 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.630
 aluminum etcetera here I think it's used 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 I remember that I was what they are 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.540
 conduct 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.270
 You can not see but there are two plates 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.880
 stuck there that connect to this 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.130
 blade and there is the mine when it connects 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.660
 to the three pins I can make the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.450
 batteries you know for example let's put them 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.220
 here 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.260
 the order of the original batteries is 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.750
 inverted to that of the aluminum 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.849
 let's put ourselves here and how they see that 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.390
 when I connect this aluminum foil to 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.390
 the pins 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.120
 Well, the control works 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.700
 the same goes for aluminum only 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.239
 that they still pass current to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.239
 control 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.210
 and 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.880
 for unequal aluminum a material 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.590
 very malleable if it's in the mine so 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.110
 it is quite advisable to do it with 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.050
 aluminum there are people who have said that they 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.660
 can do with a nail with copper or with 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.190
 such a thing but the truth the goal of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.700
 this video is doing it with materials 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.780
 homemade 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.549
 and not to move from one place to another 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.889
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.380
 video if you liked it because they have little hands 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.110
 above 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.900
 and if not, then down 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.830
 well the truth is not necessary to put 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.160
 blankets up do not comment either but 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.040
 he made them serve 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.750
 if they were shown useful then if I 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.410
 would help with little hands up or 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.880
 comments then this is all already know 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.070
 that if they have any problem with the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.249
 batteries or have a problem with the 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.099
 well boxes 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.610
 well it would not be free methods good almost 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.759
 free 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.310
 and it is highly recommended not to spend 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.600
 batteries already approved and the truth is the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.970
 Battery life is 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:12.750
 it's fine with the box and I think it's 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.750
 that holds up better good bye
