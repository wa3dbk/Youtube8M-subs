 the data have not protected 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.300
 as long as they are not protected by how much 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.360
 can live time online 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.020
 hardly dangling the cycles of international

 go free 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.210
 it's a cyber duel they stupidly kick out 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.200
 the hacker quickly turned out to be practically not 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.000
