if there is a pressure feedback sensor

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.120 
if there is a pressure feedback sensor
could<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> problem<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.420> again<00:01:55.130> there's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
could be the problem but again there's

that back in Alana
so<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.310> remember<00:02:31.970> seeing<00:02:32.629> that<00:02:32.750> Tora<00:02:33.470> basic<00:02:33.920> is

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
so I remember seeing that Tora basic is

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.819 
so I remember seeing that Tora basic is
where<00:02:34.340> if<00:02:34.459> it's<00:02:34.609> not<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.909> job<00:02:35.180> flow<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:36.680> he

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
where if it's not a job flow then he

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.479 
where if it's not a job flow then he
gave<00:02:36.950> us<00:02:37.250> blockage<00:02:37.819> somewhere<00:02:38.439> so<00:02:39.439> I<00:02:39.470> said<00:02:39.859> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
gave us blockage somewhere so I said the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.369 
gave us blockage somewhere so I said the
found<00:02:40.819> out<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.239> blockage<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.870> have<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.200> take

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
found out but blockage I have to take

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.129 
found out but blockage I have to take
the<00:02:42.470> ink<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.799> holistic<00:02:43.430> off<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:44.299> get<00:02:44.480> behind<00:02:44.659> the

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
the ink a holistic off to get behind the

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.679 
the ink a holistic off to get behind the
or<00:02:45.430> behind<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.579> on<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.939> integrand<00:02:47.359> see<00:02:47.510> what's

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
or behind it on the integrand see what's

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.619 
or behind it on the integrand see what's
going<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.769> take<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.069> intake<00:02:49.519> off<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
going on so I take the intake off and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.809 
going on so I take the intake off and
you<00:02:51.109> know<00:02:51.319> got<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:51.829> little<00:02:52.069> tiny<00:02:52.189> crack<00:02:52.489> right

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
you know got a little tiny crack right

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.149 
you know got a little tiny crack right
here<00:02:52.879> on<00:02:53.180> these<00:02:53.299> holes<00:02:53.569> that's<00:02:54.409> I'm<00:02:54.919> a<00:02:55.010> good

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
here on these holes that's I'm a good

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.449 
here on these holes that's I'm a good
place<00:02:55.340> all<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.519> them<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.819> got<00:02:55.939> vacuum<00:02:56.389> hoses

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
place all of them I got vacuum hoses

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.390 
place all of them I got vacuum hoses
anyway<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:58.750> us<00:02:59.750> inspect<00:03:00.709> every<00:03:00.919> way<00:03:01.040> around

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
anyway on us inspect every way around

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.259 
anyway on us inspect every way around
and<00:03:02.180> see<00:03:02.569> no<00:03:02.720> blockage<00:03:03.349> well<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.700> intake<00:03:05.120> is

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
and see no blockage well the intake is

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.300 
and see no blockage well the intake is
right<00:03:05.480> here<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.780> extra<00:03:06.379> pores<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.859> got<00:03:07.099> out

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
right here this is extra pores I got out

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.830 
right here this is extra pores I got out
of<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.579> car<00:03:07.790> does<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.269> bass<00:03:08.419> bees<00:03:08.659> go

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840

a little bit but still no blockage so

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.349 
a little bit but still no blockage so
little<00:03:54.769> carbon<00:03:55.069> team<00:03:55.250> out<00:03:55.459> here's<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.120> carbon

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
little carbon team out here's the carbon

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.750 
little carbon team out here's the carbon
I<00:03:56.750> put<00:03:57.409> on<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.530> ground<00:03:57.739> right<00:03:58.040> here<00:03:58.069> if<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.609> can

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
I put on the ground right here if I can

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.909 
I put on the ground right here if I can
find<00:03:59.090> it

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
find it

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.199 
find it
well<00:04:00.919> I<00:04:00.949> guess<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.250> wind<00:04:01.430> already<00:04:01.549> blow<00:04:01.879> it<00:04:02.090> it

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
well I guess the wind already blow it it

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.339 
well I guess the wind already blow it it
was<00:04:02.299> laying<00:04:02.479> right<00:04:02.659> here<00:04:02.780> somewhere

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
was laying right here somewhere

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.349 
was laying right here somewhere
they<00:04:03.919> went<00:04:04.099> already<00:04:04.310> blow<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:04.819> now<00:04:06.099> so<00:04:07.359> this

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
they went already blow it now so this

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.569 
they went already blow it now so this
piece<00:04:08.780> right<00:04:08.810> here<00:04:09.169> this<00:04:10.180> piece<00:04:11.180> right<00:04:11.659> here

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
piece right here this piece right here

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.399 
piece right here this piece right here
bolt<00:04:13.579> behind<00:04:14.650> right<00:04:15.650> here<00:04:17.049> let<00:04:18.049> me<00:04:18.079> see<00:04:18.380> that

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
bolt behind right here let me see that

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.649 
bolt behind right here let me see that
again<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.310> see<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:19.639> black<00:04:19.880> kiss<00:04:20.150> right<00:04:20.419> here

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:25.400 
again and see that black kiss right here
run<00:04:21.470> for<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.829> blockage<00:04:22.400> I'll<00:04:23.180> like<00:04:23.690> okay

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
run for this blockage I'll like okay

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.070 
run for this blockage I'll like okay
and<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.770> piece<00:04:26.070> can<00:04:26.760> see--we<00:04:26.940> go<00:04:27.300> right

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
and this piece can see--we go right

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.620 
and this piece can see--we go right
there

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
there

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.380 
there
