you<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> AC<00:02:15.600> because<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:16.440> did<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
you see the AC because we did this

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.240 
you see the AC because we did this
before<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.600> safe<00:02:18.959> seven<00:02:19.350> so

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
before it's it's in the safe seven so

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.630 
before it's it's in the safe seven so
it's<00:02:20.430> usually<00:02:20.640> like<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.860> now<00:02:22.860> I'm<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.280> to

500 millivolts this usually works pretty

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.170 
500 millivolts this usually works pretty
good<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.670> these<00:02:44.790> scopes<00:02:46.640> I'm<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> move

it told me that I'm crazy doing that and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
it told me that I'm crazy doing that and
said<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> trigger<00:02:52.739> was<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.220> range<00:02:53.340> we

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
said the trigger was out of range we

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
don't give a damn I'm going to go here

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.610 
don't give a damn I'm going to go here

to 500 milliseconds 900 and 500 very
easy<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.980> remember<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> second<00:03:03.600> day<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
easy to remember now the second day of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.330 
easy to remember now the second day of
the<00:03:03.900> haul<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.320> we'll<00:03:04.620> play<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.160> a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
the haul and we'll play with it for a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
the haul and we'll play with it for a
better<00:03:05.519> resolution<00:03:05.850> from<00:03:06.239> let's<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.660> we'll

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
better resolution from let's see we'll

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.390 
better resolution from let's see we'll
start<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.650> got<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.830> dead<00:03:08.040> hole

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.080 

I<00:03:15.620> want<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.680> do<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.799> couple<00:03:17.159> of<00:03:17.250> things<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.730> to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
I want to do a couple of things here to

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.500 
I want to do a couple of things here to
actually<00:03:18.870> move<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.769> up<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.220> little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.519> he's

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
actually move this up a little bit he's

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.759 
actually move this up a little bit he's
going<00:03:21.689> to<00:03:21.750> make<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.349> goes<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> little

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
going to make it so it goes a little

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.949 
going to make it so it goes a little
more<00:03:22.890> negative<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.090> zero<00:03:24.510> line<00:03:24.750> is

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
more negative so that the zero line is

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.140 
more negative so that the zero line is
more<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.379> middle<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.769> screen<00:03:26.150> well

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
more in the middle of the screen well

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.539 
more in the middle of the screen well
but<00:03:27.360> then<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.599> don't<00:03:27.659> want<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.930> lose<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.200> hump

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
but then we don't want to lose the hump

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.630 
but then we don't want to lose the hump
yeah<00:03:29.549> that's<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.060> window<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.400> want

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
yeah that's the window and then I want

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.759 
yeah that's the window and then I want
to<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.790> able<00:03:32.939> to<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.989> freeze

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
to be able to get to the freeze

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.649 
to be able to get to the freeze
so<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.430> don't<00:03:35.609> burn<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> motor<00:03:36.510> out

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
so we don't burn this on the motor out

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.660 
so we don't burn this on the motor out
then<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.260> drive<00:03:37.769> your<00:03:37.920> home<00:03:38.099> Olivia

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
then I have to drive your home Olivia

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.149 
then I have to drive your home Olivia
car<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.930> other<00:03:40.170> one<00:03:40.349> have<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> really<00:03:41.010> really

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
car the other one have a really really

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:51.590 
car the other one have a really really
long<00:03:41.519> walk<00:03:41.760> okay<00:03:42.569> yeah<00:03:42.840> let's<00:03:43.200> crank

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.270 

now<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.870> could<00:03:53.200> play<00:03:53.470> with<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.800> time-base<00:03:54.220> a

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
now I could play with the time-base a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.360 
now I could play with the time-base a
little<00:03:54.670> more<00:03:54.850> but<00:03:55.150> look<00:03:55.510> at<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.200> way<00:03:57.160> they

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
little more but look at this way they

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.190 
little more but look at this way they
got<00:03:57.520> five<00:03:57.790> cylinders<00:03:58.300> here<00:03:58.450> but<00:03:58.600> look<00:03:58.780> there

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
got five cylinders here but look there

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.610 
got five cylinders here but look there
it<00:03:59.290> is

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
it is

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.520 
it is
and<00:03:59.940> if<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.270> do<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.840> with<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.500> know

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
and if you do it with you know

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.160 
and if you do it with you know
repetitively<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.910> can<00:04:04.090> actually<00:04:04.360> see<00:04:04.990> it's

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
repetitively you can actually see it's

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.870 
repetitively you can actually see it's
all<00:04:05.290> gonna<00:04:05.440> slow<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.710> time-base<00:04:06.280> up<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.700> little

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
all gonna slow the time-base up a little

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.520 
all gonna slow the time-base up a little
bit<00:04:07.920> I'm<00:04:08.920> going<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.130> come<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.910> now

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
bit I'm going to come down and now

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.160 
bit I'm going to come down and now
rather<00:04:11.530> than<00:04:11.970> 500<00:04:12.970> milliseconds<00:04:13.660> I'm<00:04:13.810> going

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
rather than 500 milliseconds I'm going

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.510 
rather than 500 milliseconds I'm going
to<00:04:14.230> go<00:04:14.350> through<00:04:14.680> one<00:04:14.860> second

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
to go through one second

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.820 
to go through one second
now<00:04:15.910> let<00:04:16.150> me<00:04:16.180> explain<00:04:16.630> something<00:04:16.989> very<00:04:17.500> very

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
now let me explain something very very

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.820 
now let me explain something very very
important<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.840> very<00:04:20.049> important<00:04:20.590> thing<00:04:20.709> I

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
important the very important thing I

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.910 
important the very important thing I
want<00:04:20.860> to<00:04:21.130> explain<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:22.260> what<00:04:23.260> you're<00:04:23.530> gonna<00:04:23.590> see

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
want to explain is what you're gonna see

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.650 
want to explain is what you're gonna see
up<00:04:24.070> here<00:04:24.100> as<00:04:24.370> far<00:04:24.640> as<00:04:24.700> settings<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.630> a

depending<00:04:31.570> on<00:04:31.690> outreach<00:04:32.080> these<00:04:32.770> are<00:04:32.980> good

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
depending on outreach these are good

let's go it may never win and I was

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.410 
let's go it may never win and I was
saying<00:04:41.170> before<00:04:41.350> sometimes<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.460> time<00:04:42.970> base<00:04:43.210> or

the voltage basis by division sometimes
by<00:04:45.580> screen<00:04:46.080> also<00:04:47.080> some<00:04:47.440> scopes<00:04:47.800> had<00:04:48.100> eight

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
by screen also some scopes had eight

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.300 
by screen also some scopes had eight
some<00:04:49.150> scopes<00:04:49.510> have<00:04:49.750> ten<00:04:50.170> so<00:04:50.860> if<00:04:50.980> it's<00:04:51.130> by

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
some scopes have ten so if it's by

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.460 
some scopes have ten so if it's by
division<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.300> numbers<00:04:52.660> would<00:04:52.810> change<00:04:53.140> based

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
division the numbers would change based

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.990 
division the numbers would change based
on<00:04:53.680> how<00:04:53.740> many<00:04:53.920> grids<00:04:54.340> there<00:04:54.520> are<00:04:54.670> on<00:04:54.880> that

particular scope most of the new scopes

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.830 
particular scope most of the new scopes
are<00:04:57.580> ten<00:04:57.850> by<00:04:58.060> tens<00:04:58.480> okay<00:04:59.440> not<00:05:00.010> 8<00:05:00.400> by<00:05:00.610> 9<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.060> right

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
are ten by tens okay not 8 by 9 is right

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.170 
are ten by tens okay not 8 by 9 is right
ten<00:05:02.050> by<00:05:02.260> tens<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.890> we<00:05:03.490> should<00:05:03.700> say<00:05:03.910> if<00:05:03.970> you

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
ten by tens and we should say if you

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.300 
ten by tens and we should say if you
want<00:05:04.420> this<00:05:04.570> picture<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.990> look<00:05:05.260> bigger<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
want this picture to look bigger the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.150 
want this picture to look bigger the
amplitude<00:05:06.910> you<00:05:07.450> lower<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.930> voltage<00:05:08.110> if<00:05:08.650> you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
amplitude you lower the voltage if you

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.000 
amplitude you lower the voltage if you
want<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.520> picture<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:10.120> look<00:05:10.230> more<00:05:11.230> spread<00:05:11.830> out

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
want the picture to look more spread out

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.180 
want the picture to look more spread out
you<00:05:12.880> make<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.360> time<00:05:13.600> base<00:05:13.900> lower<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.800> that's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
you make the time base lower and that's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.920 
you make the time base lower and that's
when<00:05:15.400> we<00:05:15.520> just<00:05:15.550> have<00:05:15.880> we<00:05:16.060> had<00:05:16.180> five<00:05:16.450> solders

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
when we just have we had five solders

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.660 
when we just have we had five solders
only<00:05:17.230> showing<00:05:17.440> up<00:05:17.650> this<00:05:18.160> should<00:05:18.460> give<00:05:18.640> us

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
only showing up this should give us

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.250 
only showing up this should give us
whole<00:05:18.940> sense<00:05:19.240> it'll<00:05:19.690> actually<00:05:19.810> give<00:05:20.140> us

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
whole sense it'll actually give us

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.019 
whole sense it'll actually give us
almost

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.629 

all<00:05:28.019> right<00:05:28.199> got<00:05:28.439> you<00:05:28.589> too<00:05:28.769> repetitive<00:05:29.099> pumps

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
all right got you too repetitive pumps

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.829 
all right got you too repetitive pumps
there<00:05:30.269> you<00:05:30.389> go

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:30.839 
there you go

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.939 
there you go
and<00:05:31.759> notice<00:05:32.759> the<00:05:32.909> crash<00:05:33.239> let's<00:05:34.169> analyze<00:05:34.739> it<00:05:34.769> a

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
and notice the crash let's analyze it a

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.549 
and notice the crash let's analyze it a
little<00:05:35.099> bit<00:05:35.279> notice<00:05:36.239> a<00:05:36.569> little<00:05:37.139> bit<00:05:37.259> of<00:05:37.409> a

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:37.559 
little bit notice a little bit of a

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:41.779 
little bit notice a little bit of a
crash<00:05:37.860> here<00:05:38.419> but<00:05:39.419> this<00:05:39.719> the<00:05:40.079> wideness<00:05:40.789> the

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
crash here but this the wideness the

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.269 
crash here but this the wideness the
height<00:05:42.089> same<00:05:43.049> thing<00:05:43.289> here<00:05:43.469> the<00:05:43.619> wideness<00:05:44.099> the

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
height same thing here the wideness the

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.789 
height same thing here the wideness the
height<00:05:44.459> you<00:05:45.119> can<00:05:45.239> see<00:05:45.569> that<00:05:45.899> these<00:05:46.199> all<00:05:46.559> look

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:46.799 
height you can see that these all look

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:50.359 
height you can see that these all look
similar<00:05:47.209> the<00:05:48.209> one<00:05:48.509> before<00:05:48.809> to<00:05:49.319> 1/2<00:05:49.709> the<00:05:50.009> Solem

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:50.369 
similar the one before to 1/2 the Solem

is going to be affected by the some that
has<00:05:52.139> a<00:05:52.169> problem<00:05:52.789> but<00:05:53.789> this<00:05:53.999> is<00:05:54.239> real<00:05:54.509> easy<00:05:54.539> to

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.909 
tests you can't go any further I'm going
to<00:06:14.999> take<00:06:15.239> this<00:06:15.479> off<00:06:17.689> AC<00:06:18.689> and<00:06:19.439> I'm<00:06:19.649> gonna<00:06:19.739> have

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
to take this off AC and I'm gonna have

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.929 
to take this off AC and I'm gonna have
to<00:06:19.949> go<00:06:20.219> down<00:06:20.429> here<00:06:20.819> and<00:06:21.379> I<00:06:22.379> want<00:06:22.949> to<00:06:23.039> go<00:06:23.129> DC<00:06:23.699> now

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
to go down here and I want to go DC now

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.999 
to go down here and I want to go DC now
though<00:06:24.179> I'm<00:06:24.839> gonna<00:06:25.079> put<00:06:25.259> this<00:06:25.379> down<00:06:25.439> put<00:06:25.889> it

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
though I'm gonna put this down put it

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.739 
though I'm gonna put this down put it
back<00:06:26.159> on<00:06:26.369> the<00:06:26.459> screen<00:06:26.549> so<00:06:26.909> you<00:06:27.059> can<00:06:27.089> see<00:06:27.269> it<00:06:27.599> a

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:27.749 
back on the screen so you can see it a

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.949 
back on the screen so you can see it a
lot<00:06:28.079> better<00:06:28.499> and<00:06:29.389> we're<00:06:30.389> going<00:06:30.539> to<00:06:30.569> be<00:06:30.689> using

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:30.959 
lot better and we're going to be using

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:35.749 
lot better and we're going to be using
the<00:06:31.259> scan<00:06:31.559> tool<00:06:31.949> as<00:06:32.719> well<00:06:34.099> so<00:06:35.099> we<00:06:35.219> can<00:06:35.249> look<00:06:35.579> at

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
the scan tool as well so we can look at

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.529 
the scan tool as well so we can look at
the<00:06:35.939> oxygen<00:06:36.539> sensor<00:06:37.459> at<00:06:38.459> the<00:06:38.519> same<00:06:39.029> time<00:06:39.360> and

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
the oxygen sensor at the same time and

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.689 
the oxygen sensor at the same time and
iterate<00:06:40.189> we<00:06:41.189> are<00:06:41.339> not<00:06:41.610> on<00:06:41.879> AC<00:06:42.119> couple<00:06:42.689> and<00:06:43.699> I

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
iterate we are not on AC couple and I

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.079 
iterate we are not on AC couple and I
don't<00:06:44.849> want<00:06:45.389> channel<00:06:45.869> 2<00:06:46.110> on<00:06:46.759> so<00:06:47.759> I'm<00:06:47.879> going<00:06:48.059> to

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:48.089 
don't want channel 2 on so I'm going to

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:51.919 
don't want channel 2 on so I'm going to
take<00:06:48.269> channel<00:06:48.689> 2<00:06:48.929> and<00:06:49.579> I'm<00:06:50.579> gonna<00:06:51.029> take<00:06:51.239> two

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:51.929 
take channel 2 and I'm gonna take two

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:54.649 
take channel 2 and I'm gonna take two
and<00:06:52.379> I'm<00:06:52.979> gonna<00:06:53.129> take<00:06:53.849> it<00:06:54.029> off<00:06:54.179> so<00:06:54.419> now<00:06:54.599> you

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
and I'm gonna take it off so now you

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.519 
and I'm gonna take it off so now you
only<00:06:55.050> see<00:06:55.379> a<00:06:55.559> yellow<00:06:55.919> screen<00:06:57.379> we're<00:06:58.379> going<00:06:58.409> to

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:58.529 
only see a yellow screen we're going to

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:05.689 
only see a yellow screen we're going to
change<00:06:58.889> our<00:06:59.279> voltage<00:07:00.439> to<00:07:03.709> let's<00:07:04.709> go<00:07:04.949> two<00:07:05.249> bolts

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 
change our voltage to let's go two bolts

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.469 
change our voltage to let's go two bolts
for<00:07:06.059> the<00:07:06.089> whole<00:07:06.269> screen<00:07:07.249> okay<00:07:08.249> I'm<00:07:08.819> going<00:07:09.419> to

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
for the whole screen okay I'm going to

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.639 
for the whole screen okay I'm going to
move<00:07:09.749> this<00:07:10.339> down<00:07:11.339> a<00:07:11.399> little<00:07:11.849> bit<00:07:12.379> so<00:07:13.379> we<00:07:13.499> can

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:13.649 
move this down a little bit so we can

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.129 
move this down a little bit so we can
see<00:07:13.919> almost<00:07:14.249> a<00:07:14.549> full<00:07:14.789> range<00:07:15.149> that<00:07:15.749> gives<00:07:15.989> us

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 
see almost a full range that gives us

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.609 
see almost a full range that gives us
some<00:07:16.319> good<00:07:16.499> stuff<00:07:16.879> I'm<00:07:17.879> going<00:07:18.299> to<00:07:18.360> make<00:07:19.349> the

00:07:19.609 --> 00:07:19.619 
some good stuff I'm going to make the

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:23.869 
some good stuff I'm going to make the
whole<00:07:19.829> screen<00:07:21.319> 2<00:07:22.319> seconds<00:07:22.919> per<00:07:23.099> division<00:07:23.459> of

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 
whole screen 2 seconds per division of

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:28.189 
whole screen 2 seconds per division of
per<00:07:24.479> screen<00:07:24.779> which<00:07:25.529> breaks<00:07:25.889> it<00:07:26.099> down

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:30.840 

into<00:07:29.199> the<00:07:29.260> division<00:07:29.680> divide<00:07:29.979> that<00:07:30.190> into<00:07:30.430> ten

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850 
into the division divide that into ten

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.780 
into the division divide that into ten
and<00:07:31.210> it<00:07:31.870> would<00:07:32.020> give<00:07:32.229> us<00:07:32.410> a<00:07:33.120> 200<00:07:34.120> millisecond
