00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello girls welcome to the channel today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.210
 I have this video of complaints not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.610
 complaints but I do want to give them some 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 recommendations of three products that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.110
 never never in life would I ever go back to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.050
 buy not because it's blood does not not 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.119
 found the sense that someone else have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.260
 of putting and in life buying these 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.239
 things that do not promise to serve but in 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.610
 they do not really work for what I say 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.269
 it is that I have a hard time prowled 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.270
 around 4 to 8 dollars are nine more 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.370
 or less but not just me 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.559
 buy and they do not work for him 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.989
 quite a few women who still do not 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.520
 They are wrong to buy them and they 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:01.550
 I'm going to start with this base first 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.550
 of maybelline which is like in mus 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:10.300
 actually nothing else uses it as some 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.300
 three times it's like the waves and it's like that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.880
 and this is supposed to owe to 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.640
 water and this is like your base that you're going 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.590
 to put reality to reality, you think that 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 this is makeup I do not know if I do not know 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.729
 use very well or what wave but the truth 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.790
 as makeup is not at all what 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.310
 The only good thing you have is that you have 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.720
 the sun but it's very little is 16 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.940
 then as you want 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.950
 see what it looks like 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.380
 Yeah, I kind of cover a little bit but see 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.130
 as you as part of it gets into 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.130
 between the lines 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.070
 I did not like it, I would not buy it again 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.969
 It has a rich smell, how it smells 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.429
 sunscreen but in itself it does not work what 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.380
 I feel though it's maybelline and this 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.179
 brand I like a lot but this thing 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.920
 It does not work unless you have a skin 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.180
 perfect and it's as sticky as not 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 the other makeup bases this is not 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.310
 a base base but it serves to cover but 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.780
 it really is not at all anything else 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:32.630
 you give yourself like a do not know how a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.060
 a healthy tone but it does not cover anything 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.800
 the next thing I buy and this is 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.720
 it's also from maybe and I do not want to say 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.060
 that this brand is bad to the best 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.400
 someone else if this works for you and if you 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.440
 like but not me 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 this eyeliner will buy it and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.230
 I taught in a makeup show 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.060
 and I just showed them in the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.090
 I had not opened the package, I told them 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.760
 I wanted to try a new one the truth 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.490
 is that I did not like it says to shake it 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.200
 ok but that is a duo that comes as 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.170
 two in one and said it was like for more 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.760
 thick and thin what the only thing 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:18.730
 I know is that they look at the skewer and it's 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.730
 thick and if you put it that way it's thin 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.870
 the thick 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.489
 and the skinny is the only thing that serves 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.250
 thick in the the quito 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.280
 but in reality they see how is the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.270
 consistency 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.270
 like water 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:42.140
 on the other hand other eyeliners if they paint 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.390
 more if this one does not 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.330
 the only thing that maybe would use the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.010
 brochita for some other eyeliner 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.230
 good to use what I like the one that does not 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.600
 I like the brush but in reality this 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.410
 it's like water and then it's done like 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.170
 plastic or sticky like closed 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.330
 my eye and it hit me and I said I'm going to 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.690
 give a second chance and I used it 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.630
 again and no more no and yes, yes 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.100
 I like it is that if it's like very 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.200
 hard to take off I have my hand like 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.049
 almost wet makeup that I put on and 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.400
 as you want it is not removed it does not get stained 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.389
 it runs but 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.360
 very little, almost not, but that's the only thing 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.020
 that I do not like that maybe I need 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.699
 leave it so that it dries and it 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.580
 make like more 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.820
 the consistency a little thicker 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.270
 because as well as three used ones that 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.650
 I have given moment does not work and many of 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.800
 you had told me also that no 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.660
 They liked this one, not that I had not 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.430
 worked like that is how I get 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:00.590
 that you did not like this eyeliner 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.980
 another thing is in why yes 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.980
 i 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.560
 it's a bronzer 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.330
 good looks almost I wanted to use it as 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.639
 for this part like this is the one that I use 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.310
 I had finished then I will use 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:24.129
 this other that is of the same brand nothing 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.129
 more different as presentation 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.590
 this says it's a page partner and this one 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.590
 he says he is a brown without a father 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:40.390
 and this does not pigment anything but it is 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.760
 how to leave the flashes like 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.630
 highlight that it goes here nothing else leaves it 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.480
 like this because in reality coffee does not 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.200
 do not paint if you see that nothing else is the color 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.510
 Golden 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.610
 coffee does not paint anything if you paint but 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.950
 when this is so with the brush the 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:07.280
 only one that holds more as it is more 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:11.600
 loose is this and the coffee very just 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:15.730
 instead, this other one is going to show you 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.730
 this one that is like the pictures like this 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.909
 it is released then later and this the two 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:27.710
 colors are released not just the white 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:30.860
 but also the coffee 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:35.969
 if it 's like more coffee is the one that does not 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.249
 I like it but no no no no 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.310
 the golden is released more so I feel 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.560
 that I do not like it 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.890
 and will not buy it again maybe I'll 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.380
 finish as I say maybe I'll finish 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:51.560
 these three products I'm not going to 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.840
 stretch but I will use them but not 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.940
 I would buy these two products again 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.920
 because they did not work for me maybe 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.220
 you guys if it works but I do not 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.140
 are or pigmentation or that the gold 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.270
 nothing more like highlanders and I know 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.220
 I would recommend but if you want like to 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.020
 outline is what I used for 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.140
 proceed as if to contour my face 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.440
 and no no no no no it worked for me 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.470
 it has nothing to cover anything 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.290
 zero unless you gave it about 30 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.080
 layers but but very little coverage and 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.630
 this its consistency is almost water me 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.820
 I think this cost with about 8 dollars this 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.130
 also this one if it's cheaper with about 4 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.020
 dollars all I got in woman 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.840
 All these products disappointed me 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.630
 What am i going to do 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.730
 and germ for the next I hope and 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:44.350
 you also serve them if they had 

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:46.389
 thought of buying any of these three and 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.130
 there was no bad spend on your money and buy 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.680
 better products than if they are going to 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.780
 work this is all we see ourselves in the 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.990
 next video and I have a lot left until 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.990
 then
