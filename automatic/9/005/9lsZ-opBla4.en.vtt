the shoulders slightly keeping that head
right<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.730> target<00:00:51.180> okay<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> see

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
right on that target okay so you see

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.990 
right on that target okay so you see
them<00:00:52.199> looking<00:00:52.320> over<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> shoulder<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.879> a

them looking over that shoulder that's a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.779 
them looking over that shoulder that's a
good<00:00:54.149> way<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> okay<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:56.219> our<00:00:56.370> goal<00:00:56.550> is

good way to do that okay now our goal is
not<00:00:57.390> Dontrelle<00:00:58.020> Willis<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.410> Hideo<00:00:58.739> Nomo<00:00:59.210> so

not Dontrelle Willis or Hideo Nomo so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
not Dontrelle Willis or Hideo Nomo so
don't<00:01:00.449> let<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.780> pitchers<00:01:01.050> turn<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.530> far<00:01:01.829> they

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
don't let your pitchers turn so far they

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.490

lose their body control through all of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
lose their body control through all of
this<00:01:04.680> movement<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> pitchers<00:01:05.610> head<00:01:05.790> should

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
this movement the pitchers head should

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.719 
this movement the pitchers head should
stay<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.900> foot<00:01:09.080> awesome<00:01:10.490> okay<00:01:11.490> a

stay over there back foot awesome okay a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.030 
stay over there back foot awesome okay a
common<00:01:12.630> flaw<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> balance<00:01:13.560> point<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
common flaw we see a balance point is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.240 
common flaw we see a balance point is
that<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.729> head<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.939> off-center<00:01:15.630> okay<00:01:16.439> head

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that the head is off-center okay head

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
that the head is off-center okay head
can<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.640> center<00:01:18.000> front<00:01:18.840> knee<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.110> not

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can be off center front knee is not

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
can be off center front knee is not
raised<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> consistent<00:01:20.430> an<00:01:20.490> appropriate

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
raised to a consistent an appropriate

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.499 
raised to a consistent an appropriate
height<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> keep<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> knee<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> show<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
height so keep that knee to show that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
height so keep that knee to show that
knee<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
knee down just a little bit like that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
knee down just a little bit like that
okay<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> need<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> hip

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
okay we want that need to get up to hip

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.210 
okay we want that need to get up to hip
height<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.900> direct<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.320> flaws<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.009> two

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
height to direct these flaws we do two

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
height to direct these flaws we do two
drills<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.299> down<00:01:33.509> drill<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> the

looking for okay up and down the hands
in<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> end<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.330> front<00:02:33.330> leg<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.900> to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
in the end the front leg are going to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.900 
in the end the front leg are going to
move<00:02:34.170> together<00:02:34.440> he's<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.490> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> lose<00:02:35.850> any

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
move together he's not going to lose any

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
of his balance and then he's at the end

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.440 
of his balance and then he's at the end
