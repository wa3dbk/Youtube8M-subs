00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.540
 yes big in fashion actually arises 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.269
 in mathematics just because many always 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.900
 say it's just about paying and just about 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.870
 count 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.429
 I do not want to talk sweetly again 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.670
 but the mathematics also hold clearly 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.439
 I know that it's about pattern gdr 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.449
 everyone is clear when you go to 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.519
 Example I'll say two now 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.619
 triangles have and expects then or you 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.800
 should calculate two triangles +3 triangles 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.579
 I think everyone knows that one 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.430
 then I could have a total of 53 corner 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.420
 So say two triangles are +33 vertices 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 53 in total if you have one now 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.789
 gossip two triangles +3 circles 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.620
 then I can not expect that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.620
 I can not do two triangles +3 circles 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.719
 expect it if you do it accordingly 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.160
 pay afterwards and have letters where 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 many then always say come now too 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.119
 still to pay and compute operations 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.799
 even letters to it as terrible 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.080
 is because mathematics in school 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.430
 it's about recognizing patterns this 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.270
 pattern talks about her life someday 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.890
 always need 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.869
 if you have any things to do 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.509
 edit and the same 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.909
 We have games here if we have two 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.880
 kilometer plus 700 meters you have 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.250
 I can not recognize 2 plus 700 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.369
 simply calculate because I have miles 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.040
 and meter we are not at 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.020
 the case that we have two things the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.060
 we never charge each other 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 can because here comes the vocabulary 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 yet to wear or recognize that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 pattern kilometers and meters 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.250
 since I can each unit 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.939
 so you can say two 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.880
 kilometers are a total of 2,000 meters 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.630
 plus 700 meters and now I have exactly 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.090
 I can sum up the case too 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.869
 2700 meters the same game euro 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.670
 and are not like euro and dollar 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.520
 but you can do whatever 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.610
 For example, calculate the euros in 700 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.930
 cents plus 2 cents are total 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.760
 702 cent pattern recognized danger banned 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.530
 was important and can be fun too 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.730
 if you are not too much 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.310
 fixed on numbers and operations 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.209
 Letters but there a bit 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.560
 looks on 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.870
 I hope he talks about it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.090
 otherwise I hope that helps you 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.720
 just with this recognize from 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.720
 structures
