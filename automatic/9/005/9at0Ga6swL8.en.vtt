a good sized mpv in the Ford range the
s-max<00:00:08.069> has<00:00:08.309> become<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.610> popular<00:00:08.820> choice<00:00:09.150> with

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
s-max has become a popular choice with

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.080 
s-max has become a popular choice with
those<00:00:09.660> needing<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.139> extra<00:00:10.590> space<00:00:11.090> after

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
those needing that extra space after

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.999 
those needing that extra space after
taking<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> test<00:00:12.900> drive<00:00:13.170> three<00:00:13.830> members

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
taking it on a test drive three members

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.590 
taking it on a test drive three members
of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> public<00:00:14.490> gave<00:00:15.000> us<00:00:15.150> their<00:00:15.480> thoughts

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.660 

I<00:00:22.690> think<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.650> car<00:00:23.860> really<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:24.220> aimed<00:00:24.520> at

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
I think the car really is aimed at

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.130 
I think the car really is aimed at
families<00:00:25.120> but<00:00:25.270> I<00:00:25.330> think<00:00:25.600> there<00:00:25.690> is<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.840> broader

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
families but I think there is a broader

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.010 
families but I think there is a broader
appeal<00:00:26.530> than<00:00:26.590> that<00:00:27.280> I<00:00:27.430> think<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.730> s-max<00:00:28.090> could

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
appeal than that I think the s-max could

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.040 
appeal than that I think the s-max could
be<00:00:29.140> driven<00:00:29.350> by<00:00:30.180> somebody<00:00:31.180> commuting<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.900> could

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
be driven by somebody commuting it could

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.780 
be driven by somebody commuting it could
be<00:00:32.140> driven<00:00:32.290> by<00:00:32.440> family<00:00:32.830> used<00:00:33.070> by<00:00:33.190> families<00:00:33.640> I

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
be driven by family used by families I

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.790 
be driven by family used by families I
think<00:00:34.180> it's<00:00:34.300> an<00:00:34.390> all-around<00:00:34.480> car<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:35.200> think<00:00:35.710> it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
think it's an all-around car I think it

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.680 
think it's an all-around car I think it
is<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:35.950> multi-purpose<00:00:36.489> boot<00:00:36.820> looking<00:00:37.480> at<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
is a multi-purpose boot looking at the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.330 
is a multi-purpose boot looking at the
s-max<00:00:38.050> from<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.410> outside<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:38.950> can<00:00:39.040> see<00:00:39.220> it's

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
s-max from the outside you can see it's

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.080 
s-max from the outside you can see it's
a<00:00:39.460> big<00:00:39.700> vehicle<00:00:41.370> here's<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.489> people<00:00:42.879> carrier

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
a big vehicle here's a people carrier

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
a big vehicle here's a people carrier
and<00:00:43.510> inside<00:00:43.870> you've<00:00:44.590> got<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.770> fantastic<00:00:45.489> space

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and inside you've got a fantastic space

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.799 
and inside you've got a fantastic space
so<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.379> people<00:00:48.250> can<00:00:48.760> sort<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.239> spread<00:00:49.540> out<00:00:49.570> a

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
so that people can sort of spread out a

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:58.160 
so that people can sort of spread out a
bit<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.050> be<00:00:50.320> comfortable
