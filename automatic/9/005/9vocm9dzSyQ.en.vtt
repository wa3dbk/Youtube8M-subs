the<00:01:48.579> back<00:01:48.759> here<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:53.250> that's<00:01:54.250> what<00:01:54.460> we've<00:01:54.610> got

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the back here so that's what we've got

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.429 
the back here so that's what we've got
now<00:01:55.569> I<00:01:55.600> need<00:01:55.960> opinions<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:58.000> what's<00:01:58.960> wrong<00:01:59.259> with

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
now I need opinions on what's wrong with

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.109 
now I need opinions on what's wrong with
this<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.060> need<00:02:01.209> to<00:02:01.479> do<00:02:02.700> sound<00:02:03.700> really<00:02:03.939> like

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
this what I need to do sound really like

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.120 
this what I need to do sound really like
I<00:02:04.240> said<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:05.380> don't<00:02:05.530> want<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.709> do<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.830> pulled

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
I said really don't want to do I pulled

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.999 
I said really don't want to do I pulled
the<00:02:06.250> spark<00:02:06.549> plugs<00:02:07.229> smell<00:02:08.229> them<00:02:08.500> they<00:02:08.679> smelled

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
the spark plugs smell them they smelled

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.850 
the spark plugs smell them they smelled
a<00:02:09.190> little<00:02:09.429> bit<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.759> coolant<00:02:10.650> so<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.680> think

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
a little bit of coolant so I think

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.650 
a little bit of coolant so I think
that's<00:02:12.220> why<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.519> it's<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.940> head<00:02:13.180> gasket

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that's why I think it's this head gasket

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.610 
that's why I think it's this head gasket
here<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.170> driver's<00:02:14.560> side<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:16.620> apparently

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
here on the driver's side and apparently

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.500 
here on the driver's side and apparently
after<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.130> little<00:02:18.310> bit<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.580> research<00:02:18.910> that's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
after a little bit of research that's

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.180 
after a little bit of research that's
what<00:02:19.690> goes<00:02:19.900> wrong<00:02:20.170> most<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.709> time<00:02:20.799> with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
what goes wrong most of the time with

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.380
