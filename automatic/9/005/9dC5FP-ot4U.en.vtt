00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
you can actually walk through the hole

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.369 
you can actually walk through the hole
in<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.820> wall<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:14.240> i'll<00:00:15.240> show<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> forging

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in the wall so i'll show you the forging

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.769 
in the wall so i'll show you the forging
after<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.640> explain<00:00:17.970> how<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> works<00:00:18.390> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
after this and explain how it works you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.109 
after this and explain how it works you
walk<00:00:18.960> forward<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.250> blows<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
walk forward and it blows up in the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.939 
walk forward and it blows up in the
rocks<00:00:21.300> all<00:00:21.630> fall<00:00:21.869> apart<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> there's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
rocks all fall apart and it there's

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.380 
rocks all fall apart and it there's
actually<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> hole<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> wall<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.210> can

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
actually a hole in the wall that you can

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.210 
actually a hole in the wall that you can
walk<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.619> walk<00:00:25.769> through<00:00:25.800> than<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
walk that you can walk through than that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
walk that you can walk through than that
happen<00:00:26.699> because<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.590> there's<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.710> spot<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
happen because the there's a spot that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
happen because the there's a spot that
you<00:00:29.400> step<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.849> makes<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> explosion

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you step in that makes the explosion

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.229 
you step in that makes the explosion
triggers<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.910> obviously

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
triggers it and then you can obviously

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.620 
triggers it and then you can obviously
put<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:34.620> rocks<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:35.100> whatever<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.760> make

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
put different rocks or whatever and make

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
put different rocks or whatever and make
it<00:00:36.750> look<00:00:36.840> different<00:00:37.020> or<00:00:37.530> whatever<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> want

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to do is we'll get rid of these rocks

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:11.100 
to do is we'll get rid of these rocks
right<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:59.180> someone<00:01:00.180> move<00:01:00.570> these<00:01:00.780> rocks<00:01:01.020> back

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.630 

hmm<00:01:12.110> yeah<00:01:12.560> i'm<00:01:12.680> checking<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.219> see<00:01:13.399> if<00:01:13.430> they're

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
hmm yeah i'm checking to see if they're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.289 
hmm yeah i'm checking to see if they're
scripted<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.469> correct<00:01:15.770> channel<00:01:21.759> okay<00:01:22.759> so

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
scripted to the correct channel okay so

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.929 
scripted to the correct channel okay so
what<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.259> want<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.469> do<00:01:24.590> first<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:25.100> build<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.579> Ark

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
what you want to do first is build a Ark

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.289 
what you want to do first is build a Ark
way<00:01:26.210> out<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.600> rocks<00:01:26.929> don't<00:01:27.500> worry<00:01:27.679> about<00:01:27.770> the

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
way out of rocks don't worry about the

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.399 
way out of rocks don't worry about the
explosive<00:01:29.299> volumes<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.049> will<00:01:30.170> get<00:01:30.259> to<00:01:30.380> that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
explosive volumes you will get to that

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.410 
explosive volumes you will get to that
later<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.369> build<00:01:31.549> an<00:01:31.670> ark<00:01:31.880> way<00:01:32.090> out<00:01:32.299> of

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
later so you build an ark way out of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.809 
later so you build an ark way out of
rocks<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:32.929> can<00:01:33.049> detail<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.679> as<00:01:33.860> much<00:01:34.549> as<00:01:34.579> you

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
rocks you can detail it as much as you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.669 
rocks you can detail it as much as you
want<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.630> actually<00:01:35.899> put<00:01:36.079> rocks<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
want you can actually put rocks in the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.069 
want you can actually put rocks in the
ground<00:01:36.890> where<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.369> looks<00:01:37.610> like<00:01:37.750> little<00:01:38.750> bits

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
ground where it looks like little bits

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.719 
ground where it looks like little bits
and<00:01:39.289> pieces<00:01:39.799> of<00:01:39.829> flip<00:01:40.100> rock<00:01:40.369> like<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.600> and

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
and pieces of flip rock like that and

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.240 
and pieces of flip rock like that and
you<00:01:43.729> just<00:01:43.819> build<00:01:44.060> an<00:01:44.119> ark<00:01:44.270> way<00:01:44.479> surround<00:01:45.409> it

just gonna place them all around and you

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.840 
just gonna place them all around and you
want<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.170> make<00:02:24.260> sure<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.769> on<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> very<00:02:25.549> very

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
want to make sure that on the very very

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.520 
want to make sure that on the very very
top<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:27.200> uh<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:29.299> can<00:02:29.450> hold<00:02:29.600> rocks<00:02:29.959> like

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
top that uh it can hold rocks like

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.590 
top that uh it can hold rocks like
normal<00:02:31.310> rocks<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:31.880> accidentally<00:02:32.269> grab<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
normal rocks and accidentally grab the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.039 
normal rocks and accidentally grab the
timer<00:02:32.840> right<00:02:33.049> there<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:35.480> fill<00:02:35.750> up<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
timer right there so just fill up the

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.500 
timer right there so just fill up the
hole<00:02:36.230> with<00:02:36.519> how<00:02:37.519> many<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.209> make<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.389> as

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
hole with how many you can make it as

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.410 
hole with how many you can make it as
big<00:02:38.660> as<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.870> want<00:02:39.079> and<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:40.180> make<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.209> to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
big as you want and just make it to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.330 
big as you want and just make it to
where<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.630> can<00:02:41.780> hold<00:02:41.959> little<00:02:42.380> bits<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.799> rock<00:02:43.010> on

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
where it can hold little bits of rock on

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.180 
where it can hold little bits of rock on
the<00:02:43.549> top<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.870> then<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.230> go<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> natural<00:02:48.190> rock

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the top so then you go to natural rock

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.460 
the top so then you go to natural rock
small<00:02:50.030> rock<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.569> make<00:02:50.690> sure<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.900> physics<00:02:51.260> on

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
small rock and make sure the physics on

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.460 
small rock and make sure the physics on
normal<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.700> they<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:52.970> fall<00:02:53.239> in<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.720> rocks

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
normal so they can fall in the rocks

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.550 
normal so they can fall in the rocks
disappear<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.310> right<00:02:56.060> here<00:02:56.510> at<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> hard<00:02:57.349> time

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
disappear and right here at a hard time

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.110 
disappear and right here at a hard time
putting<00:02:57.859> the<00:02:58.069> rocks<00:02:58.280> up<00:02:58.519> there<00:02:58.549> but<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.030> can

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
putting the rocks up there but you can

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.610 
putting the rocks up there but you can
put<00:02:59.299> as<00:02:59.420> many<00:02:59.599> rocks<00:02:59.959> as<00:03:00.139> you<00:03:00.260> want<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
put as many rocks as you want and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.710 
put as many rocks as you want and
whatever<00:03:00.889> different<00:03:01.400> shapes<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.209> sizes<00:03:02.420> of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
whatever different shapes and sizes of

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.199 
whatever different shapes and sizes of
rocks<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.170> want<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.560> right<00:03:04.489> here<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> had<00:03:05.180> a

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
rocks you want and right here I had a

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.699 
rocks you want and right here I had a
bit<00:03:05.389> of<00:03:05.420> trouble<00:03:05.540> putting<00:03:06.109> it<00:03:06.319> on<00:03:06.440> there

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.830 

and<00:03:13.709> eventually<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.550> said<00:03:14.970> screw<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.450> drop

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
and eventually I just said screw it drop

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.660 
and eventually I just said screw it drop
the<00:03:16.019> rock<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.440> pulled<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.890> pulled<00:03:17.550> out<00:03:17.640> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
the rock and pulled the pulled out a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:31.870 
the rock and pulled the pulled out a
little<00:03:17.910> rock<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.390> where<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.569> can<00:03:18.690> hold<00:03:18.840> it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.070 

and<00:03:32.720> then<00:03:32.990> after<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.590> want<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.190> to

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
and then after that you want to go to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.950 
and then after that you want to go to
gadgets<00:03:36.080> explosives<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:38.480> want<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.690> spawn

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
gadgets explosives and you want to spawn

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.520 
gadgets explosives and you want to spawn
in<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.650> bunch<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.510> explosion<00:03:41.510> volumes<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.410> make

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
in a bunch of explosion volumes and make

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.070 
in a bunch of explosion volumes and make
sure<00:03:42.560> they're<00:03:42.800> invisible<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.930> get<00:03:45.050> a

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
sure they're invisible and you get a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.080 
sure they're invisible and you get a
scripting<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.890> make<00:03:46.070> sure<00:03:46.100> they're<00:03:46.580> scripted

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
scripting and make sure they're scripted

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.390 
scripting and make sure they're scripted
to<00:03:47.270> channel<00:03:47.810> broadcast<00:03:48.710> channel<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.310> two<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
to channel broadcast channel of two and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.300 
to channel broadcast channel of two and
just<00:03:52.400> start<00:03:52.730> throwing<00:03:52.760> them<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.510> there<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:58.040> I

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
just start throwing them in there and I

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.890 
just start throwing them in there and I
was<00:03:58.430> actually<00:03:58.610> pulling<00:03:59.210> these<00:03:59.390> apart<00:03:59.780> to

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
was actually pulling these apart to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.250 
was actually pulling these apart to
check<00:04:00.140> what<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:01.150> actual<00:04:02.150> broadcast<00:04:02.810> channel

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
check what a actual broadcast channel

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:13.170 
check what a actual broadcast channel
they<00:04:03.410> were<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.070> turned<00:04:04.520> out<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.790> be<00:04:04.940> too

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.390 

this<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.170> those<00:04:14.349> two<00:04:14.530> broadcast<00:04:14.980> channel

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
this is that those two broadcast channel

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.599 
this is that those two broadcast channel
two<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:18.160> after<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.699> you<00:04:18.970> want<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.329> spawn<00:04:19.720> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
two and after that you want to spawn a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.050 
two and after that you want to spawn a
trigger<00:04:21.609> on<00:04:21.940> exit<00:04:22.900> off<00:04:23.580> which<00:04:24.580> would<00:04:24.759> be<00:04:24.789> under

trigger on exit off which would be under

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.499 
trigger on exit off which would be under
scripting

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:31.939 
trigger on exit off and then put a

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.239 
trigger on exit off and then put a
