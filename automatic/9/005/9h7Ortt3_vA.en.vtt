00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello, I want to present to your 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:19.350
 Headphones Review 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:24.960
 panasonic rp htf 600 means these before 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.119
 headphones were called technics model there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 I don’t remember exactly what he does with 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.280
 number 600 then they became panasonic 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.260
 as far as I remember, I want it this way 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 look at her design they mean 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 I have more than six months 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.640
 a little bit here the inscriptions under perls but in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:59.539
 principle still safe and sound 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:05.510
 pillows work out too 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:10.640
 kozhzama so soft quite normal 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:14.400
 normal quality you foam 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 overlapping speaker itself on those 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 design here and so is everything 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:26.580
 hanging out if i'm so everything is so learning 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.210
 keeps from being able to fix them 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.770
 somehow here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.770
 normal position no adjustment 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.340
 the other side of the ocean 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.530
 Means fixing no big 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.530
 this is not the account of these three new 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.630
 limiters here if you just pull 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:05.080
 here this notch there climbs such 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.170
 see if the retainer pull it out 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.530
 only up to this point if from this yet 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:17.250
 a little further if we do not press anything 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:22.080
 takes away but all the attack on himself and the hall is hidden 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:26.380
 fluently small 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.920
 good quality in principle 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.209
 at a rather high level headphones 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.810
 not the cheapest 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.319
 quality should be like this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.810
 bass sound of course gorgeous high too 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.150
 ok but 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.630
 midrange as remembered is not enough 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:54.239
 vocal sounds and peace to me very much 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:58.120
 great for me to convey they were koss ur-20 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.440
 there the midrange vocals sounded much 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 nicer nubasa there compared to these 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.860
 there was almost none even there 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.950
 In principle, the sound was very good. 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
 quality is such a range over the neck 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.200
 wide 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.420
 so here is such a cable cable length 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:28.150
 3 meters soft still books did not break 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.920
 I'm such a connector has gold plated 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.100
 complete adapter to fight for a larger 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 this 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.610
 I don't know where he is lying there 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.830
 no interesting design it yourself 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.230
 the headphones sure are pretty strong 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:52.300
 i'm outside the hizo final is completely nothing 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:56.970
 broke there while everything is fine here 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:07.110
 here is a little scroll the whole thing 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:14.890
 it means the package box was set 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:19.750
 packed specifications somewhere 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:28.720
 Russian knocked can someone be 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:33.210
 interesting focus gone but then now 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.210
 foreign just getting glistened 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:02.039
 Such are the characteristics or not, but if 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:16.789
 press pause i think what to read 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:22.610
 it will be possible to do everything in China 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:25.740
 with a focus on in china 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.719
 but I don’t know now almost everyone 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.139
 grades something non chinese hard to buy 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:43.710
 as from the company panasonic something like as if 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:48.120
 not such a package in principle 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:52.800
 I am pleased with the headphones sound very and 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:59.550
 such a moment means very well as 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.080
 These headphones are open sound when 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.729
 you listen to something 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.330
 very audible out well as in 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:13.080
 principle and in the headphones you can hear that 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:15.569
 happens outside in the room if i 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.569
 it doesn't hurt much when i'm 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.699
 loud listening to music wife says 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:26.599
 make it quieter because it prevents 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.599
 watch TV here is such a nuance 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:35.659
 Well, in principle, and in the afternoon all to all 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.659
 thank you for your attention bye
