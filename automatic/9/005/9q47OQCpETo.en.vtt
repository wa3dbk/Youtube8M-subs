it about 444 inches tall for 30 kilos
I've<00:00:29.550> taught<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.420> connected<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.840> show<00:00:31.080> up

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
I've taught if it's connected to show up

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.340 
I've taught if it's connected to show up
to<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> 2s<00:00:31.830> lipo<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.809> haven't<00:00:33.809> done<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.960> which

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
to the 2s lipo I haven't done that which

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.380 
to the 2s lipo I haven't done that which
is<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> things<00:00:34.860> cut<00:00:35.100> off<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> staff

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is one of the things cut off the staff

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.650 
is one of the things cut off the staff
the<00:00:36.570> receiver<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:39.149> actually<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.540> bit

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the receiver it's actually a little bit

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.130 
the receiver it's actually a little bit
narrower<00:00:39.989> than<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> stock<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.989> can

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
narrower than the stock one so you can

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.880 
narrower than the stock one so you can
see<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.680> put<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.960> just<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.079> red<00:00:46.320> I'll<00:00:46.770> be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
see I put some just some red I'll be

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
see I put some just some red I'll be
clay<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> sides<00:00:47.930> just<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> make<00:00:49.770> sure

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
clay down the sides just to make sure

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
clay down the sides just to make sure
that<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.370> fill<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> holes<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that I fill up the holes because what I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
that I fill up the holes because what I
don't<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.170> happen<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.550> want

the young in between the servo and the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.080 
the young in between the servo and the
case<00:01:03.110> because<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> does<00:01:04.760> I've<00:01:05.760> read<00:01:05.970> about

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
case because if it does I've read about

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.990 
case because if it does I've read about
it<00:01:06.240> before<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.960> forums<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> stuff<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.000> if

it before on forums and stuff that if

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
it before on forums and stuff that if
you<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.240> rocks<00:01:09.540> jammed<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.080> they'll<00:01:10.260> actually

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you get rocks jammed in they'll actually

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710 
you get rocks jammed in they'll actually
put<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.950> pressure<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> case<00:01:11.760> it'll

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
put some pressure on the case it'll

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
put some pressure on the case it'll
cause<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.200> server<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.680> either<00:01:13.890> fail

a put thing in though make sure that you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
a put thing in though make sure that you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
want your citrine points I've actually

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.920 
want your citrine points I've actually
got<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.460> set<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> maximum<00:01:24.330> travel<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.840> the

horn<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.240> keep<00:01:33.420> driving<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.960> way

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
horn will actually keep driving one way

horn will actually keep driving one way
around<00:01:34.229> push<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.250> against<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.790> Sun<00:01:36.619> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
around push up against this Sun this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.890 
around push up against this Sun this
crash<00:01:37.920> bar<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.490> they'll<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.420> try<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
crash bar here they'll actually try and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.830 
crash bar here they'll actually try and
deform<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> twist<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:42.240> cover<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.439> an

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
deform and twist this cover it's an

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.539 
deform and twist this cover it's an
absolutely<00:01:45.840> incredible<00:01:45.990> amount<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> talk<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
absolutely incredible amount of talk in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
absolutely incredible amount of talk in
a<00:01:47.640> movement<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> servo<00:01:48.689> Scott<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> just

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a movement for the servo Scott it just

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.819 
a movement for the servo Scott it just
blows<00:01:49.470> me<00:01:49.680> away

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.450 

yeah<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.729> pull<00:01:54.000> back<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:55.159> crazy

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
yeah it will pull back it's just crazy

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
yeah it will pull back it's just crazy
speed<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.479> thing<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.810> pretty<00:01:57.960> insane<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
speed on this thing is pretty insane I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.200 
speed on this thing is pretty insane I
should<00:01:58.649> actually<00:01:58.799> throw<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> few<00:01:59.729> batteries<00:02:00.090> on

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
should actually throw a few batteries on

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
should actually throw a few batteries on
this<00:02:00.329> thing<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this thing and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.490 
this thing and
and<00:02:03.030> show<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.299> how<00:02:03.420> fast<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:03.930> wheels<00:02:04.229> turn

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and show you how fast these wheels turn

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.760 
and show you how fast these wheels turn
back<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.920> forth<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.310> no<00:02:05.460> learner<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.909> just

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
back and forth with no learner it's just

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.109 
back and forth with no learner it's just
absolutely<00:02:07.770> insane<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.340> cannot<00:02:08.670> believe<00:02:08.940> how

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
absolutely insane I cannot believe how

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
absolutely insane I cannot believe how
quick<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.899> steering<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.530> this
