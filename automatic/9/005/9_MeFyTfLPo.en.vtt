00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
electricity bill by roughly 50% it's a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.500 
electricity bill by roughly 50% it's a
very<00:01:52.470> green<00:01:52.710> investment<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.610> those<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
very green investment and those are the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.300 
very green investment and those are the
things<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.780> we

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
things that we

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.730 
things that we
to<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:56.390> stay<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:57.189> carbon<00:01:58.189> neutral<00:01:59.119> as<00:01:59.420> possible

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
to to stay is carbon neutral as possible

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.010 
to to stay is carbon neutral as possible
so<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.799> think<00:02:00.920> one<00:02:01.189> of<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.430> real<00:02:02.270> innovative
