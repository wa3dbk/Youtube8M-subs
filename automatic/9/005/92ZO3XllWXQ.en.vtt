00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.539
 and hello to everyone and to whom 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.730
 we meet to test the demo of this 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.529
 platoon there I will work at 7h this 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.310
 morning we take advantage there it is 5 o'clock 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.660
 to test that very quickly not share the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.410
 all waking up so in my opinion it's going 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 not be beautiful to see 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 so I was we have a little tutorial to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.210
 my beginning obviously the test I 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.719
 been served as an orian that I know little 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.719
 near what he's doing 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.630
 a dead person 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 we do not care we made a film 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.500
 beautiful kids we are not anyway 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500
 I want to tell you 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.980
 it's hard superior sighting per year 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.730
 you spent a way for each other but 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:33.020
 his enemies I find his voice 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.720
 made strong turns into land march 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.390
 is so beautiful 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.390
 what they did 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.800
 if the big corner after that is the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.400
 roll also apparently well 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.150
 kidding 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.150
 this roll sector 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.400
 not to expose ourselves for the moment in 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.400
 any case 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.590
 what 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.590
 what are they doing 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.019
 Why 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.290
 already present then totally dominated 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.290
 the part 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.840
 heard at the prison the struggle led by 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.840
 week 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.900
 I do not know if it will have served what I have 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.190
 done in the end we should have won there 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.269
 it shows me I really do not 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.599
 the impression of having played badly in this 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.599
 first part 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.060
 that's a pity 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.300
 I'm trying a change of weapons we're going 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.110
 test the roll for example I you 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.110
 say right now 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.820
 ok it's gone I feel like we have 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.410
 a new map is not talking too loudly 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.330
 obviously today because it's 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.630
 5 am as I said one 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.630
 neighbors 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.700
 we have a roll we do not represent 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.319
 what 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:42.300
 in my opinion I learned a lot I have a 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.620
 good ready to go I hope the roll 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.620
 these people to do testing michael 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.170

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:02.600
 m10 pid roll mlg work like one 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:02.600

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.430

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.770
 like alexis will make the game mastery 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.770
 total easy gameplay to take 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.889
 and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.069
 aulas at the very young red 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.110
 mondoulet kg work it will remain one of 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.319
 bigger actions despite all 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.319
 the temperature 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.810
 adults 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.350
 in fact the means to make good 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.350
 buddies we roll 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.000

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.370
