00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.660 
and it's a matte color the second time I
did<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.600> did<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.739> with<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.040> silver<00:02:35.310> color

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
did this I did it with this silver color

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.240 
did this I did it with this silver color
which<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.270> do<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.510> well<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:36.989> has<00:02:37.170> a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
which you can do as well but has a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.740 
which you can do as well but has a
shimmer<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.000> actually<00:02:39.569> looks

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
shimmer to it and that actually looks

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.690 
shimmer to it and that actually looks
better<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:40.290> my<00:02:40.440> opinion<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.070> it's<00:02:41.220> up<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.550> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
better in my opinion but it's up to you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.490 
better in my opinion but it's up to you
then<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.600> will<00:02:42.750> use<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.590> dark<00:02:43.890> gray<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.550> my<00:02:44.610> outer

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
then I will use a dark gray in my outer

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.220 
then I will use a dark gray in my outer
corners<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.790> define<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.660> will<00:02:48.989> use

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
corners and then to define it I will use

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.330 
corners and then to define it I will use
a<00:02:49.650> black<00:02:50.640> deep<00:02:51.060> black<00:02:51.390> color<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.320> will<00:02:53.160> take

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
a black deep black color I will take

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
that same black color and apply this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580 
that same black color and apply this
underneath<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.940> eye<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.930> will<00:02:58.170> create<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
underneath the eye this will create the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.330 
underneath the eye this will create the
sunken<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.610> effect<00:03:00.440> under<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.590> black<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.100> will

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
actually really fun to do um it kind of

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.009 
actually really fun to do um it kind of
gave<00:03:56.730> me<00:03:56.970> an<00:03:57.180> evil<00:03:57.750> look<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:59.930> extended<00:04:00.930> it

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
gave me an evil look and I extended it

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.280

down<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.230> little<00:04:01.530> bit<00:04:01.739> as<00:04:01.920> well<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:04.079> looked

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
down a little bit as well so it looked

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.410
