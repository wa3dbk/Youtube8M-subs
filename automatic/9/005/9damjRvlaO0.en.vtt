00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.729
 which the company is involved in a role 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:13.779
 For the Schalke 3 Karl Angerer of Wednesday was a duel Mac not this one 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.240
 Aggressiveness of Allan McNish 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.080
 Flowers is 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.509
 has gone sets the tire pile 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.829
 Of course, a hit did not look like that for me 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.460
 first gas out again so cleverly disassembled car pretty much 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.769
 yes this is not this important game between GC and prototypes 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.140
 the Ferrari has closed "the principle of the Nati 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 is being negotiated 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.940
 the crop which already has a lot of talent back then 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 led by the prince couple unfortunately in a different direction 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 catapulted more wanted to drive actually in heavy impact in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.380
 tire wall 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.460
 and to be different because neither the spectators nor the photographer and also 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.990
 if he did nothing 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.700
 because there are parts flying around more 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.750
 as I said it was looking tough but through the tire piles and the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.150
 Safety of the vehicles 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.870
 hope that Helmut Willms 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.000
 while Ferrari had sat Anthony Beltoise 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 yes I think I could not see him in the rearview mirror you can see 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.010
 probably only 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.480
 a car 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.210
 As guests they were always more canteens one eye do not see the other 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.750
 12 SÃ©bastien Loeb from the under or conscripted and abandoned but me 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.150
 Guess he did not think that part of the north shore you can he could 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.460
 did not even see what top-deck was racing through the car between 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 the evil accident of the scared faces at the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.880
 it is clear that there is always what was there 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.010
 thank goodness shaken certainly 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.550
 speaks for the safety of the vehicles, thank God, absolutely great 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.580
 moving moments on the return of Ulrich w 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.800
 that was looked violent 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.490
 We have not wanted to be seen for many years and have not been seen for many years 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.170
 but I have to say that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.590
 more violent than quick-witted 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.550
 you should be honest I am not so relieved and so completely 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.600
 calms me down that there but there a lot of Rome has flown and 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.329
 Way, the spectators started that it was definitely going towards 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.410
 Photographers marshals gone there I was not at all white 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.840
 that really all the others also from the trauma money 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.209
 are not affected 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.900
 is that very good, but in the end nothing has happened but is a recognized one 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.159
 is the hail really bad caught on the bike 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.199
 a bar is flown in so that he already 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.089
 a similar also for that with no longer got along well 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.109
 it was almost almost of both safety standards today 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.629
 but expect Neubauer impact but the big question something like this he is behind 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.299
 the guardrail happens 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.239
 On the one hand, luck that it did not pass over the guardrail 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.469
 also that two adults fractions second so Hauser the proven other 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.099
 Side would fly 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.859
 because he still can go out pretty bad absolutely that was the biggest 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.539
 Lucky factor that the car has not gone over the guardrail 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.619
 into the photographers crowd in there 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.169
 after all, there were really nothing left for me to fly around 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:56.359
 has been
