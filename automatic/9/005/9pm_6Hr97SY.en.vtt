00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.719

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:26.660
 the intro good yes here we are too 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.270
 already and yes that's pretty cool that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.010
 boils at night at day one sees 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.550
 you but just not matter how the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.760
 clear 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.050
 it is very very beautiful you are right 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.210
 many new blocks added items not so 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.800
 which one can use properly but yes we 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.220
 We can do this at night sometimes 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.170
 aquarium now set up here 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.840
 and yes that's pretty cool first 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.969
 So these things new items the purposes 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.969
 you are with me 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.000
 they are here and they are 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.530
 are actually all double brand 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.530
 rather look at decoration here are 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420
 which can also be all this new and that 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.900
 you do not know how to get that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.460
 you build the easiest way 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:24.770
 that's the easiest way to go 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:29.150
 a max here you can break down so and 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.070
 then the top teams will be like that and yes me 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.060
 wanted you all the single ones now 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 So things once point upwards 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.950
 the surface 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.890
 So we have just two new blocks 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.570
 So right blocks and that and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.740
 always slip that annoys yes 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.710
 quite sometime she coral these 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.930
 and once the dry coral and yes 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 we can just place that and 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.409
 we can plant the plants 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.119
 not now because we do not have water 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.040
 need like here you can do that 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.460
 this water in it and that 's just 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.769
 a little bit of a park and yes then 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.120
 I'll start with the banks so me 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.120
 can go to someone 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.420
 and yes , so then you go through here 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.190
 the industry of course with so the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.620
 just so oxygen against all the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.800
 blue which runs at night I can now 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:34.400
 let's show moment so close and without the 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.160
 blue would here do not light the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 you immediately equally dark light dark 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.330
 generation to the water surface 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.440
 Then comes brown that is like a 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.870
 Cactus is really fucking yes and at 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.920
 the green is so yes yes there you will 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.590
 a bit slower in it 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.780
 So you can see here by one 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.220
 has slowly but the other yes the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.200
 actually have no effects so again 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.240
 off and yes that's it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.760
 The actual murder is a short one though 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.380
 a very very beautiful and if you are 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.960
 now you ask yourself the motto and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.660
 like installed at the same time or something and so 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.880
 ask yourself like so many things with me 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.950
 not so good under water so here 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.820
 with me so clearly uses whether the fine under 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.020
 Options Graphics settings and details 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.050
 Can you turn the water on nicely? 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.570
 make and once there is quality 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.150
 the water clearwater and if you are 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.610
 would make out the trade manager 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.120
 me even if I look at things again 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.880
 quality and yes it is then easy 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.220
 pretty cool and yes it is real 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.890
 funny also really nice lighting effects 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.260
 are that and yes I think the mod is 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.500
 very cool I hope we can do 50 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.700
 likes that once we're cool and yes if 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.960
 you like it then something 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.940
 spreads because I show myself now 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.420
 on the desktop the installation up 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.420
 equal 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.790
 soja now we are on the desktop for 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.650
 installation and what will be needed 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.530
 once the minecraft forge the installer 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.710
 and for yes and for the murder of course 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.210
 also the mod both united point 6.4 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.130
 just go into the description there 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.590
 with 1 left there we come here 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.420
 Here we can have a few more 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.830
 to press screenshots once to 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.830
 example shows the example of one 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.930
 coral reef mod download then on 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.390
 download and the download is already 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.310
 but we do not need that because I have that 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.400
 So yes, just have one 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.990
 doubleclick on the minecraft then 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.240
 Pay attention that everything through the selected 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.210
 is like my father's father in minecraft 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.070
 minecraft folder tunes and wears 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.870
 ok then we go to go again 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.490
 if he says that it succeeds 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.050
 is installed then pushes the 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.640
 windows button and he then opens 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.650
 the window version and enters there 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.980
 percent appdata percent return okay 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.420
 then goes to the point minecraft folder 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.970
 in the mods folder creates a rds and 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.740
 So watch out so be sure 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.940
 First you have to get out if you want 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.500
 do not know if all the rotz with 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.030
 Compatible it may be that it 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.980
 then it does not work best 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.360
 first take out I know it works 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.510
 and yes I kind of like that so far 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.980
 pull into 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:20.160
 and it does hither to me, and how 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:24.140
