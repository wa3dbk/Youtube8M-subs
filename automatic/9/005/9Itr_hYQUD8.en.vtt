00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:16.320
 and good morning everyone here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.230
 I bring a new tutorial to improve in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.960
 hello 4 today is going to try to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.050
 the sensitivity of the game 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.029
 if you do not know that sensitivity is the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.270
 time it takes you to flip 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.670
 side to side or to move your diste 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.430
 well how can we not say you crociere 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.690
 your weapon the time it takes you to move 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 I'll leave here some examples 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.570
 and I'm going to discuss which is the best because 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.440
 it depends on each person then 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.130
 well for example me when I play 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.550
 like to play in corner mode because 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.190
 I already got used to hitting with the see as 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.409
 in color of shore I stayed but 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 I have a sensitivity of 8 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.659
 that allows me to make the sensitivity of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 8 turn around faster if they are 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.770
 shooting back I have one more speed 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 quick to be able to shoot them but 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.289
 what are the problems that if you're not 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.829
 used to this sensitivity is going to 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.720
 cost a lot of work to aim and give 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.570
 your 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.330
 to your goals if you notice here in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.120
 right says that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.590
 the low sensitivity speeds 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.770
 are for people who have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 difficulty in pointing out the more 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 high are for people who have played 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 pull it then you already understand more or less 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.940
 how it works in me in my review them 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 I would recommend that you put a sensitivity 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.450
 as big as they can if they can 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.700
 get to 10 so much better me 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.720
 right now I'm playing in 8 because then 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.770
 well is playing in turi tail and I think 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.789
 that with 8 I'm fine 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.519
 already reach 10 because in some cases already 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.310
 it's a lot of exaggeration but in others and 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.060
 it works pretty well then the most 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.420
 high that you can get used to and that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.450
 give people to put it there because you 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.470
 will help to improve your game and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.490
 to this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:37.660
 the type of buttons 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.180
 the button layout is optional to 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.370
 I like it better just like that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.670
 that there is a little problem to be able 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.800
 run and paste I get confused a bit but 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.110
 Well, it's nothing more than a matter of 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 Get used 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:58.900
 then if you have difficulty in targeting 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.050
 Well, I would recommend that you do not 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.800
 you care about your candle you're going to have some 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.700
 problems at the beginning but the more 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.770
 the more you play the more 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.930
 and grab your experience you will know that 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.670
 you will get used to it and that your 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.340
 doubts will go reacting better and everything 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.670
 so I recommend that you have 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.519
 a high sensitivity between 8 and 10 is what 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.980
 better than they can have is tense aware 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.480
 for more halo tutorials 4 I hope that 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 they have been very useful this and 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.950
 subscribe for more there will be a lot 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.069
 the halo 4 I hope you liked it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.069
 Give it like thanks and bye
