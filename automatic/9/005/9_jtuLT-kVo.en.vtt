00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.400 
it I'm currently using about a small
plate<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> small<00:00:24.930> container<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
plate using a small container of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
plate using a small container of
powdered<00:00:25.830> clay<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.699> mixed<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.119> water

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
powdered clay that I mixed with water

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
powdered clay that I mixed with water
and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:28.019> only<00:00:28.170> consumed<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and I really only consumed about a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.759 
and I really only consumed about a
teaspoon<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.820> mixed<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.689> water<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.230> the

teaspoon of that mixed in water in the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.799 
teaspoon of that mixed in water in the
morning<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> evening

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
morning and the evening

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.590 
morning and the evening
now<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.079> started<00:00:34.590> consuming<00:00:35.040> play

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
now I actually started consuming play

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.970 
now I actually started consuming play
with<00:00:36.600> Sonny's<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.829> how<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
with Sonny's I think is how you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
with Sonny's I think is how you
pronounce<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.610> s<00:00:38.760> o<00:00:38.910> n<00:00:39.059> NDS<00:00:39.600> number<00:00:40.469> seven

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
pronounce it it's s o n NDS number seven

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.610 
pronounce it it's s o n NDS number seven
hydrated<00:00:41.700> clay<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.170> an<00:00:43.379> already

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
hydrated clay and that is an already

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
hydrated clay and that is an already
liquefied<00:00:44.340> form<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.730> clay<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.270> took<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
liquefied form of clay so they took the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.299 
liquefied form of clay so they took the
powder<00:00:45.750> mixed<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.500> liquid<00:00:46.620> ahead<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> time

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
powder mixed it in liquid ahead of time

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
powder mixed it in liquid ahead of time
and<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.329> felt<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> wanted<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and I felt that was the way I wanted to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.479 
and I felt that was the way I wanted to
start<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
start out because it's really the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
start out because it's really the
easiest<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.120> simply<00:00:51.629> took<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> tablespoon<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
easiest I simply took a tablespoon of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
easiest I simply took a tablespoon of
that<00:00:52.920> mix<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.789> water<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> drank<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that mix that in water and drank that in

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470 
that mix that in water and drank that in
the<00:00:55.260> morning<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> evening<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:57.180> what

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the morning and in the evening now what

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
the morning and in the evening now what
I<00:00:57.510> did<00:00:57.719> since<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> small

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
I did since then is I got a small

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.799 
I did since then is I got a small
container<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.850> clay<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> lot<00:01:00.629> less

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
container of clay which was a lot less

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
container of clay which was a lot less
expensive<00:01:01.399> $10<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.730> small<00:01:02.910> container<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
expensive $10 for a small container and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
expensive $10 for a small container and
that<00:01:03.719> seems<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.860> last<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.519> got<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> be

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that all the play is hydrated and then

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
that all the play is hydrated and then
when<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.900> ready<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.409> consume<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.979> simply

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
when I'm ready to consume it I simply

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
when I'm ready to consume it I simply
pour<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.790> some<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> glass<00:01:24.689> maybe

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
pour out some of that into a glass maybe

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.410

add<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:25.890> water<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.210> little

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
add some water to it if it's a little

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.679 
add some water to it if it's a little
bit<00:01:28.520> if<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.670> used<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.240> less<00:01:30.329> water

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
bit if I used a little bit less water

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
bit if I used a little bit less water
originally<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.369> consume<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> just

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
originally and then I consume that just

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
originally and then I consume that just
as<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.259> easy<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.710> consume

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
as it is so it's really easy to consume

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
as it is so it's really easy to consume
you<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.810> do<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> things<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you don't have to do a lot of things to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.789 
you don't have to do a lot of things to
prepare<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> clay<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:39.360> however<00:01:40.140> let<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> sit

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
prepare the clay I do however let it sit

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
prepare the clay I do however let it sit
for<00:01:40.829> overnight<00:01:41.790> usually<00:01:42.360> before<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.780> consume

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
for overnight usually before I consume

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
for overnight usually before I consume
it<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> powder<00:01:44.430> form<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it if I use a powder form because that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
it if I use a powder form because that
way<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.009> water<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.460> fully<00:01:47.700> absorb<00:01:48.149> into

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
way and the water can fully absorb into

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.960 
way and the water can fully absorb into
the<00:01:48.479> clay<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.159> expand<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.790> have

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the clay so that I can expand and have

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.510 
the clay so that I can expand and have
its<00:01:51.119> best<00:01:51.329> impact<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:51.990> body<00:01:52.220> now<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.340> far

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.179 
as the time of day or when you should
consume<00:01:56.880> clay<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.079> said<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> consume<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
consume clay like I said I consume it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.530 
consume clay like I said I consume it
morning<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.520> evening<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.360> really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
morning and evening you can really

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.899 
morning and evening you can really
consume<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.930> any<00:02:01.079> time<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.500> day<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:02.340> yeah

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
consume it any time of the day it's yeah

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
consume it any time of the day it's yeah
you<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.320> I've<00:02:04.439> read<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you think you can from what I've read it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.210 
you think you can from what I've read it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
seems like you get the best best impact

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
seems like you get the best best impact
by<00:02:08.459> consuming<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> when<00:02:09.629> you're<00:02:09.750> not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
by consuming it when you're not

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.809 
by consuming it when you're not
consuming<00:02:10.170> any<00:02:10.319> other

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
your body in any way just by eating it

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.449 
your body in any way just by eating it
with<00:02:44.000> food<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:45.140> do<00:02:45.769> your<00:02:45.920> own<00:02:46.010> research<00:02:46.040> on

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
with food so do your own research on

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.119 
with food so do your own research on
that<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.730> decide<00:02:47.000> how<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.269> want<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
that and decide how you want to do that

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.319 
that and decide how you want to do that
but<00:02:49.129> really<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.340> would<00:02:49.519> recommend<00:02:49.940> starting

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
but really I would recommend starting

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.690 
but really I would recommend starting
out<00:02:50.480> with<00:02:51.159> hydrating<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.250> clay<00:02:52.400> ahead<00:02:52.609> of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
out with hydrating the clay ahead of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.910 
out with hydrating the clay ahead of
time<00:02:52.849> because<00:02:53.810> then<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.470> simply<00:02:54.769> have<00:02:54.889> to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
time because then you simply have to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.619 
time because then you simply have to
pour<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.370> into<00:02:55.519> water<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.090> drink<00:02:56.389> it<00:02:56.450> right

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
pour it into water and drink it right

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.229 
pour it into water and drink it right
away<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.989> it's<00:02:57.170> very<00:02:57.500> easy<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.859> do<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.909> there's

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
away and it's very easy to do so there's

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.640 
away and it's very easy to do so there's
a<00:02:59.269> lot<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.480> other<00:02:59.720> things<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.319> could<00:03:00.440> talk<00:03:00.590> about

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
a lot of other things I could talk about

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
a lot of other things I could talk about
about<00:03:01.159> clay<00:03:01.489> but<00:03:01.909> I<00:03:01.940> specifically<00:03:02.420> wanted<00:03:02.659> to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
about clay but I specifically wanted to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.119 
about clay but I specifically wanted to
talk<00:03:02.930> about<00:03:02.959> how<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.470> consume<00:03:03.859> its

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
talk about how to consume its

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.369 
talk about how to consume its
proportions<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.060> times<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.389> day<00:03:05.569> definitely

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
proportions and times a day definitely

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.990 
proportions and times a day definitely
do<00:03:06.650> your<00:03:06.680> research<00:03:06.920> before<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.549> consume<00:03:07.940> any

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
do your research before you consume any

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.280 
do your research before you consume any
