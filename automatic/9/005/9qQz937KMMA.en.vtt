made<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.869> by<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> SS<00:00:19.199> aim<00:00:19.939> more<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.119> how

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
made here by the SS aim more about how

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:31.389 
made here by the SS aim more about how
to<00:00:21.330> make<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> main<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.810> go<00:00:24.900> Daniel

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.049 

alright<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.669> fine<00:00:32.850> isn't<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:35.059> but

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
alright that's fine isn't that back but

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.830 
alright that's fine isn't that back but
I'm<00:00:37.309> basically<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.700> idea<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.090> Tess's<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I'm basically the idea of Tess's to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.430 
I'm basically the idea of Tess's to
cover<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.379> massive<00:00:40.950> area<00:00:41.690> by<00:00:42.690> only<00:00:43.079> taking

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
cover a massive area by only taking

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.060 
cover a massive area by only taking
small<00:00:44.190> veins<00:00:44.489> than<00:00:44.730> side<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.920> make

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
small veins than side so it is you make

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.810 
small veins than side so it is you make
a<00:00:47.100> mean<00:00:47.280> quarter<00:00:47.640> than<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.760> don't<00:00:50.760> know

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
a mean quarter than the I don't know

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
a mean quarter than the I don't know
it's<00:00:51.000> called<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> min<00:00:51.629> quarter<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.379> in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it's called just a min quarter but in

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's called just a min quarter but in
you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.699> way<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> ATP<00:00:54.600> by<00:00:54.840> 2000

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you can make it one way to ATP by 2000

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.930 
you can make it one way to ATP by 2000
on<00:00:55.410> our<00:00:55.590> em<00:00:57.829> but<00:00:58.829> well<00:00:59.399> first<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> all<00:00:59.820> before

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
on our em but well first of all before

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
on our em but well first of all before
you<00:01:00.180> die<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.629> head<00:01:00.960> bedrock<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> then

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you die in your head bedrock and then

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.490 
you die in your head bedrock and then
you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.309> gain<00:01:02.670> where's<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.120> each<00:01:03.690> block<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you can gain where's up each block as a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
you can gain where's up each block as a
layer<00:01:04.769> Pedro<00:01:05.760> copies<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.270> been<00:01:06.299> level<00:01:06.990> 0<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
layer Pedro copies have been level 0 and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.730 
layer Pedro copies have been level 0 and
then<00:01:07.680> 1<00:01:07.710> 2<00:01:08.400> 3<00:01:08.430> 4<00:01:08.750> forever<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.229> standing<00:01:10.500> on

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
then 1 2 3 4 forever so I'm standing on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.280 
then 1 2 3 4 forever so I'm standing on
level<00:01:11.100> 10<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> let's<00:01:14.400> level<00:01:14.700> 10<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
level 10 just now so let's level 10 and

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.899 
level 10 just now so let's level 10 and
3<00:01:16.290> Smyly<00:01:16.560> does<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.490> place<00:01:17.700> where

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
3 Smyly does because the place where

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.310 
3 Smyly does because the place where
you're<00:01:18.030> most<00:01:18.150> likely<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.600> find<00:01:18.810> diamonds<00:01:19.200> us

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you're most likely to find diamonds us

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.070 
you're most likely to find diamonds us
between<00:01:19.640> levels<00:01:20.640> 10<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.530> 16<00:01:22.530> watch<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:24.080> down

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
between levels 10 and 16 watch as down

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160 
between levels 10 and 16 watch as down
or<00:01:25.409> maybe<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> referral<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.670> sure<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.750> I'm

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
or maybe the referral not sure so I'm

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.179 
or maybe the referral not sure so I'm
Stan<00:01:28.560> de<00:01:28.740> Montagne<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:31.500> dug<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.009> far

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
Stan de Montagne and you dug up as far

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.859 
Stan de Montagne and you dug up as far
as<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.430> read<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.390> retain<00:01:33.689> work

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
as you can read to see can retain work

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.649 
as you can read to see can retain work
to<00:01:34.560> level<00:01:34.860> 16<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.909> 15<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.750> then

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
to level 16 or 15 and then

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.899 
to level 16 or 15 and then
so<00:01:39.320> once<00:01:39.469> you've<00:01:39.619> done<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:40.460> make<00:01:40.640> a

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
so once you've done that you make a

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.480 
so once you've done that you make a
quarter<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.569> way<00:01:41.719> then<00:01:42.159> doesn't<00:01:43.159> matter

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
quarter all the way then doesn't matter

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.959 
quarter all the way then doesn't matter
how<00:01:43.700> long's<00:01:44.200> just<00:01:45.369> however<00:01:46.369> much<00:01:46.609> you<00:01:46.729> want<00:01:46.759> to

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
how long's just however much you want to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.980 
how long's just however much you want to
mainland<00:01:47.539> suppose<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:47.990> then<00:01:49.270> every<00:01:50.270> two

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
mainland suppose and then every two

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.569 
mainland suppose and then every two
blocks<00:01:51.609> want<00:01:52.609> to<00:01:52.939> make<00:01:53.600> another<00:01:53.899> rain<00:01:54.579> reason

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
blocks want to make another rain reason

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.730 
blocks want to make another rain reason
why<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.729> do<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:56.030> as<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:56.600> firmly<00:01:57.229> me<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.560> one

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
why I do this as I firmly me the one

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.679 
why I do this as I firmly me the one
down<00:01:57.950> they've<00:01:58.429> already<00:01:58.670> seen<00:01:59.030> everything<00:01:59.090> on

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
down they've already seen everything on

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.620 
down they've already seen everything on
this<00:01:59.869> wall<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:01.340> he<00:02:01.520> maker<00:02:01.700> only<00:02:02.060> one<00:02:02.390> block

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
this wall so he maker only one block

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.149 
this wall so he maker only one block
white<00:02:02.869> then<00:02:03.170> you're<00:02:03.740> not<00:02:03.890> being<00:02:04.069> as

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
white then you're not being as

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.039 
white then you're not being as
productive<00:02:04.520> as<00:02:04.969> possible<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:05.569> make<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.840> to

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
productive as possible so you make it to

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.589 
productive as possible so you make it to
buy<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:07.399> you're<00:02:07.609> seeing<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:08.090> fan<00:02:08.360> as<00:02:08.569> well

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
buy it so you're seeing a fan as well

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.660 
buy it so you're seeing a fan as well
and<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.590> completely<00:02:09.950> new<00:02:10.190> site<00:02:10.429> when<00:02:10.640> you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and the completely new site when you

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.150 
and the completely new site when you
make<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.849> new<00:02:11.060> lean<00:02:11.769> because<00:02:12.769> if<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:12.980> made<00:02:13.129> a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
make a new lean because if you made a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.380 
make a new lean because if you made a
fee<00:02:13.370> why<00:02:13.489> didn't<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.849> wouldn't<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.209> what's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
fee why didn't you wouldn't see what's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.190 
fee why didn't you wouldn't see what's
in<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.599> middle<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:16.150> too<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.329> just<00:02:17.569> perfect<00:02:18.019> and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
in the middle so too is just perfect and
