about the estimate testing oh not again
yeah<00:02:17.660> not<00:02:18.590> let's<00:02:19.040> leave<00:02:19.430> these<00:02:19.580> guys<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.060> sort

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
yeah not let's leave these guys to sort

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.699 
yeah not let's leave these guys to sort
of<00:02:20.480> Hunter<00:02:20.840> no<00:02:21.200> Leah<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.860> think<00:02:23.379> I'd<00:02:24.379> rather

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
of Hunter no Leah I think I'd rather

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.500 
of Hunter no Leah I think I'd rather
they<00:02:24.980> used<00:02:25.190> other<00:02:25.400> methods<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.300> don't

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
they used other methods to I just don't

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.699 
they used other methods to I just don't
think<00:02:26.840> there<00:02:27.019> are<00:02:27.050> enough<00:02:27.110> viable

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
think there are enough viable

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.440 
think there are enough viable
alternatives<00:02:28.489> right<00:02:28.760> now<00:02:28.940> there<00:02:29.120> was<00:02:29.239> no

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
alternatives right now there was no

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.449 
alternatives right now there was no
other<00:02:29.750> way<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.709> scientists<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.280> use

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
other way the scientists can use

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.640 
other way the scientists can use
scanning<00:02:32.030> machines<00:02:32.450> computers<00:02:32.660> clinical

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650

studies<00:02:34.160> human<00:02:34.849> tissues<00:02:35.420> those<00:02:35.870> are<00:02:36.110> things

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
studies human tissues those are things

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.809 
studies human tissues those are things
that<00:02:36.380> are<00:02:36.470> still<00:02:36.680> developing<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.519> doesn't

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
that are still developing it doesn't

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.070 
that are still developing it doesn't
mean<00:02:37.940> they're<00:02:38.150> ready<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.480> take<00:02:38.660> over<00:02:38.810> from

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
mean they're ready to take over from

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.470 
mean they're ready to take over from
animals<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.799> in<00:02:40.370> my<00:02:40.519> kind<00:02:40.819> of<00:02:40.910> research<00:02:41.180> i'm
