hope<00:06:00.880> so<00:06:01.150> this<00:06:01.360> is<00:06:01.690> probably<00:06:02.320> just<00:06:02.860> bad<00:06:03.160> luck

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
hope so this is probably just bad luck

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
sure and to be cool but maybe the lock

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.870

just<00:06:39.460> needs<00:06:39.640> to<00:06:39.730> be<00:06:39.880> worked<00:06:40.060> in<00:06:41.580> one<00:06:42.580> more

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880
