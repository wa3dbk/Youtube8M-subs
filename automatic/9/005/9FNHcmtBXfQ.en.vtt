00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.100 

14<00:00:07.160> since<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.280> have<00:00:08.460> my<00:00:08.670> rhinoplasty<00:00:10.130> operation

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
14 since I have my rhinoplasty operation

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.609 
14 since I have my rhinoplasty operation
cuz<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.290> two<00:00:14.009> weeks<00:00:14.190> since<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:15.690> operation

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
cuz it's two weeks since the operation

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.370 
cuz it's two weeks since the operation
now<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.130> will<00:00:17.310> probably<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.640> my<00:00:18.270> last<00:00:18.779> video

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
now this will probably be my last video

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.040 
now this will probably be my last video
I<00:00:19.590> guess<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:21.480> much<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> really

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
I guess because not much is really

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.509 
I guess because not much is really
changing<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> haven't<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.279> got

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
changing now so I haven't really got

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.390 
changing now so I haven't really got
much<00:00:23.550> else<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.060> report

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
much else to report

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.980 
much else to report
it's<00:00:26.400> getting<00:00:26.670> quite<00:00:26.880> slow<00:00:27.150> process<00:00:27.660> from<00:00:27.869> now

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it's getting quite slow process from now

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.620 
it's getting quite slow process from now
on<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.670> tiny<00:00:29.939> changes<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
on I think with the tiny changes of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
on I think with the tiny changes of
healing<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:35.030> see<00:00:36.030> yeah<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> did

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
healing so I see yeah just what I did

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
healing so I see yeah just what I did
say<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.230> today<00:00:38.059> there<00:00:39.059> wasn't<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.329> much

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
say like today there wasn't really much

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.090 
say like today there wasn't really much
change<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> why<00:00:40.320> she<00:00:40.559> would<00:00:40.620> expect<00:00:41.010> because

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
change to why she would expect because

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.650 
change to why she would expect because
it's<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.460> dramatically<00:00:42.000> changing<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it's not dramatically changing from the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.860 
it's not dramatically changing from the
day<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> day<00:00:43.079> anymore<00:00:43.469> um<00:00:47.300> sometimes<00:00:48.300> my<00:00:48.690> nose

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
day to day anymore um sometimes my nose

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
day to day anymore um sometimes my nose
seems<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> feel<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.910> if

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
seems to take I think and I feel like if

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
seems to take I think and I feel like if
I<00:00:51.090> touch<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:51.989> bruised<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:53.190> not

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I touch it it's a bit bruised it's not

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.200 
I touch it it's a bit bruised it's not
bruised<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.030> feels<00:00:54.320> tender<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.210> I've

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bruised but it feels tender and I've

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
bruised but it feels tender and I've
seen<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:58.050> away<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.770> time<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:01.340> my

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
seen that just go away in time and my

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.329 
seen that just go away in time and my
scars<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:03.149> still<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:04.260> healing<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
scars are still like healing up and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.480 
scars are still like healing up and
starting<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> fade<00:01:06.180> away<00:01:06.210> more<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
starting to fade away more and more I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
starting to fade away more and more I
still<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.640> blood<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> nose<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.659> is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
still got some blood in my nose which is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.480 
still got some blood in my nose which is
coming<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.869> every<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.020> often<00:01:16.310> not<00:01:17.310> really

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
coming out every so often not really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
coming out every so often not really
much<00:01:17.670> else<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.970> say<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
much else to say so from that like I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.899 
much else to say so from that like I
said<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.130> gonna<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.700> slow<00:01:20.880> process

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
said it's gonna be really slow process

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910 
said it's gonna be really slow process
from<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.470> there'll<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
from now on so I don't think there'll be

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179 
from now on so I don't think there'll be
much<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:24.200> videos<00:01:25.200> I'll<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.470> making

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
much more videos I'll be making

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.830 
much more videos I'll be making
I<00:01:26.330> just<00:01:27.330> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.780> wrap<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.740> um

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
I just kind of just wrap it up really um

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.899 
I just kind of just wrap it up really um
I'm<00:01:30.840> still<00:01:31.079> doing<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.619> hope<00:01:31.829> nose<00:01:32.040> thing<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
I'm still doing this hope nose thing I

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.749 
I'm still doing this hope nose thing I
feel<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.860> kind<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.100> secures<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.670> place

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
feel like it kind of secures it in place

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819 
feel like it kind of secures it in place
while<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.240> sleeping<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.619> quite

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
while I'm sleeping so that's quite

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
while I'm sleeping so that's quite
useful<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:41.000> that's<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.450> really

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
useful and that's about it really

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.469 
useful and that's about it really
I<00:01:45.409> just<00:01:46.409> say<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.850> been<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.360> good

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I just say it's been a really good

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
I just say it's been a really good
experience<00:01:49.490> much<00:01:50.490> better<00:01:50.520> than<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> actually

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
experience much better than I actually

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630 
experience much better than I actually
thought<00:01:51.210> would<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.250> thought<00:01:53.250> I'd<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

lot<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:53.790> pain<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.329> thought<00:01:54.540> I'd<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> lot

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

lot more pain I thought I'd have a lot
more<00:01:55.020> bruising<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.890> thought<00:01:58.820> well<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> was

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060

unfortunately so yeah I was saying it's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.330 
unfortunately so yeah I was saying it's
all<00:03:57.870> good<00:03:59.180> if<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.269> see<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.449> video<00:04:00.900> then<00:04:01.500> that

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
all good if I see a video then that

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.259 
all good if I see a video then that
might<00:04:02.519> be<00:04:02.699> in<00:04:03.590> quite<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> while<00:04:04.680> maybe<00:04:05.579> just<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
might be in quite a while maybe just to

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.789 
might be in quite a while maybe just to
see<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.510> results<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.109> few<00:04:07.199> months<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.739> me

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
see the results in a few months for me

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.170 
see the results in a few months for me
we'll<00:04:08.489> see<00:04:08.639> but<00:04:10.340> at<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> moment<00:04:11.609> I<00:04:12.000> don't

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
we'll see but at the moment I don't

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.640 
we'll see but at the moment I don't
think<00:04:12.389> there's<00:04:12.510> only<00:04:12.660> much<00:04:12.840> point<00:04:13.139> because

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
think there's only much point because

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.819 
think there's only much point because
isn't<00:04:13.980> changing<00:04:14.489> dramatically<00:04:15.139> anymore<00:04:16.139> and

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
isn't changing dramatically anymore and

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.459 
isn't changing dramatically anymore and
even<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:18.449> thought<00:04:18.630> me<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.870> know<00:04:18.959> there's<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:19.469 
even I thought me you know there's a

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:20.870 
even I thought me you know there's a
difference<00:04:19.799> day<00:04:19.919> by<00:04:20.099> day<00:04:20.159> so<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.519> don't<00:04:20.820> know

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
difference day by day so I don't know

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.530 
difference day by day so I don't know
how<00:04:21.030> anyone

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
how anyone

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.340 
how anyone
this<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:22.050> and<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.910> yeah<00:04:24.090> if<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.960> are<00:04:24.990> thinking

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
this can and so yeah if you are thinking

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.700 
this can and so yeah if you are thinking
of<00:04:25.470> getting<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.520> nose<00:04:26.880> job<00:04:26.910> don't<00:04:27.360> panic

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
of getting a nose job don't panic

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.050 
of getting a nose job don't panic
because<00:04:29.780> as<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.020> see<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.790> didn't<00:04:32.790> need<00:04:32.850> you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
because as you can see I didn't need you

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
yeah even though I did a bit even though

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.580 
yeah even though I did a bit even though
I<00:04:37.590> might<00:04:38.250> have<00:04:38.370> hidden<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.730> quite<00:04:38.940> well

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
I might have hidden it quite well

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.210 
I might have hidden it quite well
see<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.520> just<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:41.940> very<00:04:42.330> specific<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.320> what<00:04:44.130> you
