00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
a bad sport and add the clocks running

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.390 
a bad sport and add the clocks running
down<00:01:30.200> fourth<00:01:30.620> quarter<00:01:30.890> you're<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.250> lead

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
down fourth quarter you're in the lead

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.580 
down fourth quarter you're in the lead
getting<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.300> V<00:01:32.510> formation<00:01:32.750> you've<00:01:33.380> got<00:01:33.500> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
getting that V formation you've got the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.740 
getting that V formation you've got the
wind<00:01:33.800> take<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.160> v2<00:01:34.760> clock<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.330> as<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.540> new

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
wind take the v2 clock is it as a new

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.030 
wind take the v2 clock is it as a new
option<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.200> added<00:01:36.410> this<00:01:36.500> year<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.860> game

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
option we added this year in the game

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.680 
option we added this year in the game
it's<00:01:37.310> basically<00:01:37.640> accelerated<00:01:38.300> clock<00:01:38.480> and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's basically accelerated clock and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.270 
it's basically accelerated clock and
what<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.110> do<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:39.560> going<00:01:40.160> to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
what it's going to do is it's going to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.610 
what it's going to do is it's going to
once<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.210> leave<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:41.750> huddle<00:01:42.080> when<00:01:42.500> you're

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
once you leave the huddle when you're

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.020 
once you leave the huddle when you're
walking<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.160> line<00:01:43.310> we're<00:01:43.520> gonna<00:01:43.640> run<00:01:43.850> off

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
walking to the line we're gonna run off

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.880 
walking to the line we're gonna run off
time<00:01:44.330> for<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.750> we're<00:01:45.080> basically<00:01:45.320> leave<00:01:45.740> you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
time for you we're basically leave you

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.560 
time for you we're basically leave you
with<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.160> think<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.430> was<00:01:46.760> about<00:01:46.910> 12<00:01:47.240> seconds

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
with I think it was about 12 seconds

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.910 
with I think it was about 12 seconds
left<00:01:47.810> on<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:47.990> play<00:01:48.230> clock<00:01:48.440> so<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.650> still<00:01:48.830> have

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
left on the play clock so you still have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.110 
left on the play clock so you still have
time<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.100> get<00:01:49.310> up<00:01:49.340> there<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:49.730> know<00:01:49.760> make<00:01:49.970> maybe

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
time to get up there you know make maybe

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.370 
time to get up there you know make maybe
one<00:01:50.390> adjustment<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.080> you'll<00:01:51.200> be<00:01:51.290> able

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
one adjustment and then you'll be able

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.200 
one adjustment and then you'll be able
to<00:01:51.470> run<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.680> ball<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.190> forgot<00:01:52.850> me<00:01:53.060> that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
to run the ball and forgot me that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.880 
to run the ball and forgot me that
lecture<00:01:53.720> on<00:01:53.840> ball<00:01:54.020> control<00:01:54.050> offense<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:54.860> a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
lecture on ball control offense it's a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.040 
lecture on ball control offense it's a
great<00:01:55.100> addition<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:55.550> way<00:01:55.760> even<00:01:56.390> outside<00:01:56.750> of
