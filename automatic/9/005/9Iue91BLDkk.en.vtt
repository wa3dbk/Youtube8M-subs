00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.030
 the arrival of the cold now on arrival 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.040
 of winter level players 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.400
 professional the low temperatures the 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.429
 they begin to use mostly as in areas 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.829
 where the cold in this case the northern area 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:25.270
 Northern Spain are areas 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.310
 where the cold attacks a little more 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.120
 and in many cases it does not affect the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.880
 sports performance way for example 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.790
 Barcelona football plays in Moscow is a 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.400
 complicated match not only by the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.080
 change hours flight hours but 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.120
 that later come to go when thermal 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.430
 brutal in this case we have a product 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.620
 that what allows us basically is 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.270
 that in full performance of the game 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.070
 after a good warm-up of a 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.110
 usual activation of any 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.330
 sportsman what this garment allows you 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.559
 is that we do not lose the temperature to 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.880
 that later when it comes back to 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.760
 make an effort we have no 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.590
 muscle problem at a time are products 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.800
 that advise us a good refrigeration 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.140
 that is to say that not only does the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.390
 heat or in the tissue and in the body to 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.399
 that we do not lose that heat but that we 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.690
 stop cooling so that sweat 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.660
 then do not leave us cold that also 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.640
 is another cause of the injuries one of the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.229
 significant elements in this in the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.910
 part of the shirt is the collar without 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.649
 have too much too much pressure 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.080
 it closes us so that the heat 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.940
 Well, we are not evacuated and can continue 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.229
 keeping at the torso level then everything 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.540
 what body heat and cooling 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.730
 court- the inner arm area 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.040
 even from the side that is the zone of 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.080
 more sweating we see how there is a 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.670
 fabric thought for the drainage on 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.770
 everything to the evacuation of liquids be 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.480
 fast effective and especially very 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 comfortable because if we continue 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.050
 retaining above all the heat of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.900
 pant one of the most elements 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.080
 significant is the lateral tissue in 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.970
 the case of the soccer player then with a 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.640
 cold and frozen grass helps us 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.290
 slide without soaking a little bit of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.200
 that cold always keeping the heat 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.000
 there is no pro-combat is a pledge that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 can help us a lot for first 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.899
 as we have said regulate the temperature 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.660
 that is constant training the airs 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.630
 cold and maintaining the temperature of 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.130
 heat that there is no sweating that we 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 it's cold and then I can not 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.620
 generate a problem and especially also 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 that compressive effect that makes us 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.980
 circulatory level then all the pressure 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.360
 of the flight all that stimulation 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.520
 circulatory than blood level that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.830
 not that it does not usually have a good route 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.580
 and usually have to usually need a couple of 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.640
 days of assimilation so avoid in the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.650
 greater percentage of the cases as a 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.459
 injury that would not be to the liking of 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.459
 esplÃºs in this case
