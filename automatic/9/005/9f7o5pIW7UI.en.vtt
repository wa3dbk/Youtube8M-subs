00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 go hi all to the knicks rise and 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.730
 have mostly connected for video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.740
 introduction on the new series which 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 is going to take place this summer I think it's going 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.400
 to be largely this summer and it's going 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110
 continue and so I told myself that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.429
 for the holidays it would be a lot of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.660
 start a series that I liked 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 but that at the time I had not too much 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.420
 time to refine it was two feed 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.859
 the beast and so for bill girl 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.199
 so I was on the site to see if he 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.599
 there was a version 5.2 and there is one 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 apparently a little buggy but good 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 I hope we will not have too many 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.110
 problem so minecraft 1.5.2 we have like 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.110
 usually in feed the beast status 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.290
 year of fashion we have a lot we really 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.760
 of both of them touched this not so we 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.250
 really going to explore them all because 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.210
 that there are really tons but in 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.770
 anyway it's clear we're going 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.540
 to brace his race no one will try to 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.100
 do a stylus trick and I have a concept 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.890
 in me I thought a little bit even 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.140
 how to call it I got to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.910
 early good words this folder to cmc tube 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.490

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.950
 little m6 knicks to good companies have 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.850
 quickly done but I did 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.440
 says me it's mega kraft mega kraft 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.000
 company and I find it's a 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.820
 super concept of phew 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.190

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.380
