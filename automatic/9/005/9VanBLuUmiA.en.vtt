00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.430
 that sinks to remove it good minute then 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.789
 this is news as in the title 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.860
 about the new ipad 5 the first 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.829
 rumors about the new ipad 5 of tuna 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 after throwing in a same year three 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:19.200
 different models of ipad like 34 and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.000
 the mini apple company seems 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.860
 who wants to completely renew the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 design of the best- selling tablet 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.670
 world to suit the design 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.830
 latest products in its range 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.259
 according to these photographs the housing 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.200
 of the ipad would be made in 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.770
 aluminum analyzed white or 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.360
 black very similar to the ipad mini 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.880
 This technique has been widely used by 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.040
 apple in recent years the aluminum of 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.350
 the products is not painted but that 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.960
 the color part of the aluminum allows 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.420
 see its metallic shine without losing 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.910
 saturation the result is a material 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.129
 that highlights the colors even though 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.010
 in some cases like the iphone 5 or 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.960
 black can scratch pse with extreme 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.809
 ease other features 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.640
 of the new design would be the reduction to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.270
 maximum of the useless black borders 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.580
 around the screen the new ipad 5 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.159
 would introduce the same technology as the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.010
 ipad mini allowing the user 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.500
 I could put my fingers on the edges 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.770
 of the screen without any trouble detecting them 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.630
 that is, the 26 is able to detect 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.970
 involuntary touches on the screen 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.250
 of the new ipad and therefore it could be 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.469
 reduce the dimensions of it 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.740
 without affecting the size of the 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.649
 screen that is 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 point 7 inches we will have to wait a 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.689
 little to see if in March this same 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.450
 year we will have a new ipad 5 if by the 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.860
 otherwise apple would set a new 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.979
 renovation cycle 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.009
 The truth is that the rumor has enough 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.899
 logical since the ipad 4 generation is the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.850
 only device of the company that does not 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.680
 It has the new characteristic design 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.530
 iphone5 ibook touch nano and ipad mini 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.300
 here are some small galleries of 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.570
 filtered images I hope you have them 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.850
