00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.100 

so<00:00:02.399> I've<00:00:02.760> made<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> couple<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.360> Liberians<00:00:03.929> in

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so I've made a couple of Liberians in

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.610 
so I've made a couple of Liberians in
the<00:00:04.200> past<00:00:04.500> but<00:00:05.600> I've<00:00:06.600> never<00:00:06.839> actually<00:00:07.170> really

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
the past but I've never actually really

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.410 
the past but I've never actually really
tracked<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.220> progress<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:09.000> them<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.360> I

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
tracked my progress of them and I

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.780 
tracked my progress of them and I
thought<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.660> would<00:00:09.860> actually<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> how-to

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
thought I would actually do a how-to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
thought I would actually do a how-to
video<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.650> what<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.799> doing<00:00:14.099> here<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:16.279> it's<00:00:17.279> my

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
video on what I'm doing here so it's my

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.490 
video on what I'm doing here so it's my
first<00:00:17.640> EXO<00:00:18.119> tear<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.840> usually<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
first EXO tear and I usually do a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.400 
first EXO tear and I usually do a
vivarium<00:00:19.800> with<00:00:20.250> water<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> bottom<00:00:21.410> I'm

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
vivarium with water in the bottom I'm

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.429 
vivarium with water in the bottom I'm
gonna<00:00:22.560> drain<00:00:22.920> hole<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> back<00:00:24.439> that

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
gonna drain hole in the back that

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.700 
gonna drain hole in the back that
actually<00:00:25.949> drains<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.580> water<00:00:27.199> out<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.500> back

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
actually drains the water out the back

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.139 
actually drains the water out the back
and<00:00:29.010> down<00:00:29.160> into<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:30.800> tank<00:00:31.800> beneath<00:00:32.009> my<00:00:32.369> vivarium

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and down into a tank beneath my vivarium

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.940 
and down into a tank beneath my vivarium
and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:33.870> that'll<00:00:34.170> pump<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> water<00:00:34.649> back<00:00:34.920> up

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and then that'll pump the water back up

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
and then that'll pump the water back up
after<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.550> filters<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> usually<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
after it filters it out so usually I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.810 
after it filters it out so usually I
have<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> waterfall<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.540> stuff<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:41.610> time

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
have a waterfall and stuff but this time

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
have a waterfall and stuff but this time
I<00:00:41.969> thought<00:00:42.180> I'd<00:00:42.329> track<00:00:42.660> everything<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.230> did<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I thought I'd track everything I did and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
I thought I'd track everything I did and
see<00:00:44.309> how<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> turned<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
see how it turned out and see what you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.610 
see how it turned out and see what you
guys<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:47.719> never<00:00:48.719> done<00:00:48.989> great<00:00:49.260> stuff

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
guys think of it never done great stuff

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.380 
guys think of it never done great stuff
but<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
but at this time I'm actually gonna do a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
but at this time I'm actually gonna do a
combination<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:53.039> pot<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.850> stone<00:00:54.149> great

some ideas and we can see some more
ideas<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.280> variety<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.790> some<00:02:19.120> five<00:02:19.329> areum's

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
ideas and variety and some five areum's

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.009 
ideas and variety and some five areum's
that<00:02:19.930> come<00:02:20.079> out<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.349> stuff<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.480> actually<00:02:22.870> I'm

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
that come out and stuff and actually I'm

just<00:02:23.200> gonna<00:02:23.319> put<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.560> link<00:02:23.829> of<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.159> guy<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.610> I

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
just gonna put a link of the guy that I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.610 
just gonna put a link of the guy that I
saw<00:02:25.329> his<00:02:25.510> idea<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.079> I<00:02:26.140> thought<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:26.590> be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
saw his idea and I thought that would be

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.910 
saw his idea and I thought that would be
cool<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.040> try<00:02:27.549> something<00:02:27.939> like<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.299> so<00:02:28.920> stay

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
cool to try something like that so stay

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.130 
cool to try something like that so stay
tuned<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.459> I'll<00:02:30.610> probably<00:02:30.989> glue<00:02:31.989> these

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
tuned and I'll probably glue these

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.729 
tuned and I'll probably glue these
pieces<00:02:32.200> down<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:32.829> from<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.459> I'll<00:02:34.739> great

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
pieces down and from there I'll great

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.399 
pieces down and from there I'll great
stuff<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.430> use<00:02:37.390> some<00:02:37.540> silicone<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.319> we'll

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
stuff and use some silicone and we'll

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.069 
stuff and use some silicone and we'll
see<00:02:38.530> how<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.739> turns<00:02:38.920> out
