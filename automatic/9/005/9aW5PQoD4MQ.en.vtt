6 x 35 minutes 10 26 by a 40 screws to
screw<00:00:50.409> in<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:50.829> tail<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.659> is<00:00:52.839> just<00:00:53.170> for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
screw in the tail and this is just for

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.049 
screw in the tail and this is just for
some<00:00:53.680> extra<00:00:54.659> security<00:00:55.659> here<00:00:55.989> I've<00:00:56.890> done<00:00:57.159> she

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
some extra security here I've done she

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.380 
some extra security here I've done she
done<00:00:58.330> these<00:00:58.540> ones<00:00:58.809> too<00:00:59.080> I<00:00:59.110> think<00:01:00.210> grab<00:01:01.210> the

see<00:01:15.950> if<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.220> fit<00:01:16.520> in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
see if that fit in

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.320 
see if that fit in
that's<00:01:18.850> good

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.710 

back<00:01:23.330> in<00:01:23.540> here<00:01:24.670> don't<00:01:25.670> want<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.910> strip<00:01:26.150> down<00:01:26.210> so

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
back in here don't want to strip down so

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.740 
back in here don't want to strip down so
you<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:26.990> also<00:01:27.890> feel<00:01:28.190> snug

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.910 

that's<00:01:33.200> it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.350 

the<00:01:41.280> plane<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.729> over<00:01:42.150> here

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.640 

and<00:01:46.510> put<00:01:47.510> this<00:01:48.670> scoop<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.930> also<00:01:51.170> do<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
and put this scoop on and also do the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.410 
and put this scoop on and also do the
antenna<00:01:52.070> at<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.370> same<00:01:52.580> time<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:53.000> downtown

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
antenna at the same time this downtown

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.810 
antenna at the same time this downtown
it<00:01:53.600> goes<00:01:53.750> back<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:55.460> have<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.730> in

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
it goes back here I don't have the in

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.020 
it goes back here I don't have the in
town<00:01:56.000> down<00:01:56.180> here<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.820> basically<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.000> just

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
town down here so basically it just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.380 
town down here so basically it just
moves<00:01:59.870> in<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.830> big<00:02:01.430> deal<00:02:01.610> there<00:02:01.910> so<00:02:02.120> I'm<00:02:02.240> just

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
moves in a big deal there so I'm just

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.280 
moves in a big deal there so I'm just
going<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:03.070> glue<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.370> this<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:05.660> is<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:06.080> a

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
going to glue on this this is just a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.090 
going to glue on this this is just a
cooling<00:02:06.800> scoop<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.790> was<00:02:07.910> on<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> real<00:02:08.300> plane

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
cooling scoop that was on the real plane

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:25.330 
cooling scoop that was on the real plane
just<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.280> touch<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.670> realism<00:02:11.090> here

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.720 

a<00:02:26.209> little<00:02:26.930> excess<00:02:27.230> glue<00:02:27.560> there<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.489> so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
a little excess glue there on that so

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.110 
a little excess glue there on that so
just<00:02:28.910> got<00:02:29.390> wait<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.550> let's<00:02:31.550> see<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.879> you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
just got wait here let's see that you

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.440 
just got wait here let's see that you
well

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:51.390 

that<00:02:43.810> movie<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:45.800> turn<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.220> here

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.309 

the<00:02:51.760> board<00:02:52.030> uses<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.599> little<00:02:52.810> bit<00:02:52.930> more<00:02:53.049> gloom

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
the board uses a little bit more gloom

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.539 
the board uses a little bit more gloom
on<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.829> than<00:02:53.980> some<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.430> other

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
on this one than some of the other

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.729 
on this one than some of the other
mouths<00:02:56.159> suppose<00:02:57.159> that's<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.459> good<00:02:57.640> thing<00:02:58.739> I'm

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
mouths suppose that's a good thing I'm

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.970 
mouths suppose that's a good thing I'm
sure<00:02:59.950> they'll<00:03:00.280> come<00:03:00.519> park<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:02.620> should<00:03:02.829> be

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
sure they'll come park that should be

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.220 
sure they'll come park that should be
enough<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.819> not<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> structural<00:03:04.659> part<00:03:04.930> so

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
enough this is not a structural part so

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.309 
enough this is not a structural part so
it<00:03:05.260> doesn't<00:03:05.620> need<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:05.769> lot<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:08.620> that

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.069 

and<00:03:11.709> then<00:03:12.010> we'll<00:03:12.159> move<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.999> the<00:03:13.629> prop<00:03:13.870> and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
and then we'll move on to the prop and

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.000 
and then we'll move on to the prop and
spinner<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.349> back<00:03:17.620> part<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
spinner so this is the back part of the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.640 
spinner so this is the back part of the
spinner<00:03:18.310> here<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:19.389> this<00:03:19.989> goes<00:03:20.230> right<00:03:20.439> out<00:03:20.499> of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
spinner here and this goes right out of

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.000 
spinner here and this goes right out of
my<00:03:20.769> chef<00:03:21.489> just<00:03:21.879> like<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.359> there's<00:03:22.719> again<00:03:23.349> just

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
my chef just like so there's again just

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.369 
my chef just like so there's again just

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
like p-51 it kind of locks in place over

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.610 
like p-51 it kind of locks in place over
one<00:03:26.560> way<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.069> go<00:03:28.109> nice<00:03:29.109> three<00:03:29.379> blades

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
one way that it can go nice three blades

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.449 
one way that it can go nice three blades
prop<00:03:29.980> here<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.719> a<00:03:31.750> pretty<00:03:32.620> beefy<00:03:32.829> profits

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
try to try to get this lined up once i

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.360 
try to try to get this lined up once i
get<00:05:18.479> one<00:05:18.690> on<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.440> rust<00:05:19.740> should<00:05:19.919> go<00:05:20.100> on

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
get one on then the rust should go on

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.029 
get one on then the rust should go on
pretty<00:05:20.639> easily<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:22.169> after<00:05:22.560> finishing

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
pretty easily so after finishing

installing the spinner that pretty much
completes<00:05:25.470> things<00:05:26.039> here<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:27.509> just<00:05:27.660> got<00:05:27.990> a

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
completes things here and I just got a

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.990 
completes things here and I just got a
hook<00:05:28.560> up<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.860> controlled<00:05:29.250> Hornets<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.729> stuff

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
and we have to do that when it's powered

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.890 
and we have to do that when it's powered
up<00:05:32.280> so<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.210> know<00:05:33.330> what<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.630> throws<00:05:33.870> are

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
up so that you know what the throws are

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.810 
up so that you know what the throws are
like<00:05:34.259> and<00:05:34.560> make<00:05:34.800> sure<00:05:34.979> that<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.340> trims<00:05:35.610> all

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820

like and make sure that the trims all
end<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.180> stuff<00:05:36.389> and<00:05:36.930> I<00:05:37.139> still<00:05:37.349> need<00:05:37.500> to<00:05:37.530> put<00:05:37.710> on

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
end and stuff and I still need to put on

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.020 
end and stuff and I still need to put on
the<00:05:37.919> controlled<00:05:38.250> horns<00:05:38.550> on<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.789> air<00:05:38.910> around

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
the controlled horns on the air around

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.110 
the controlled horns on the air around
it<00:05:39.360> runs<00:05:39.810> but<00:05:40.380> that's<00:05:40.620> about<00:05:40.860> it<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.220> next

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
it runs but that's about it and next

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.719 
it runs but that's about it and next
step<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.960> take<00:05:43.380> client<00:05:43.949> hopefully<00:05:44.639> the

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
step is to take client hopefully the

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.570 
step is to take client hopefully the
camera<00:05:45.000> will<00:05:45.180> work<00:05:45.360> better<00:05:45.599> see<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.380> then<00:05:46.580> so

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
camera will work better see you then so

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.129 
camera will work better see you then so
here<00:05:47.820> we<00:05:47.849> are<00:05:48.030> we're<00:05:48.180> going<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.389> try<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.840> BF

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
the the flaps on this so I don't know if

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.290 
the the flaps on this so I don't know if
you<00:06:16.260> can<00:06:16.380> see<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:16.590> there<00:06:16.830> but<00:06:17.010> there's<00:06:17.909> quite<00:06:18.240> a

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
you can see it there but there's quite a

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.649 
you can see it there but there's quite a
bit<00:06:18.330> of<00:06:18.449> flat<00:06:18.720> movement<00:06:19.199> and<00:06:20.659> hopefully

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
bit of flat movement and hopefully

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.230 
bit of flat movement and hopefully
that'll<00:06:21.919> allow<00:06:22.919> me<00:06:23.099> to<00:06:23.190> come<00:06:23.280> into<00:06:23.460> this<00:06:23.669> short

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
that'll allow me to come into this short

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.760 
that'll allow me to come into this short
field<00:06:24.449> a<00:06:24.570> little<00:06:24.630> bit<00:06:24.780> better<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.169> p51<00:06:25.740> I

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
field a little bit better the p51 I

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.219 
field a little bit better the p51 I
didn't<00:06:26.099> put<00:06:26.220> the<00:06:26.340> flaps<00:06:26.610> on<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.060> I've<00:06:28.020> had<00:06:28.199> a

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
didn't put the flaps on and I've had a

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.629 
didn't put the flaps on and I've had a
little<00:06:28.380> bit<00:06:28.590> of<00:06:28.620> problem<00:06:28.830> bringing<00:06:29.340> it<00:06:29.490> into

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
little bit of problem bringing it into

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.060 
little bit of problem bringing it into
the<00:06:29.820> field<00:06:30.030> so<00:06:30.470> hopefully<00:06:31.470> this<00:06:31.620> will<00:06:31.740> let<00:06:31.919> me

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
the field so hopefully this will let me

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.240 
the field so hopefully this will let me
bring<00:06:32.699> it<00:06:32.789> in<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:32.909> little<00:06:32.970> bit<00:06:33.300> easier<00:06:33.690> and

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
bring it in a little bit easier and

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.460 
bring it in a little bit easier and
we'll<00:06:35.250> see<00:06:35.490> how<00:06:36.090> it<00:06:36.120> goes<00:06:36.270> so<00:06:36.990> let's<00:06:37.169> see<00:06:37.289> what
