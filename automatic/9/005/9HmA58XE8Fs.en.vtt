 minafin konichiwa it's virtual synthesis 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.099
 courage followed by I find you in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.120
 bow of ff xiv again a donation of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.219
 a day of tips and tricks 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.150
 I'm here too for gap sky 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.910
 remember is we're going to click on the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 urban network so I'm at ul'dah the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 capital in the desert we go instead 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.710
 of laterite and because today I 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 will you talk about a way to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 communication between players because 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 that on most mmo we know the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.480
 system of being able to create gifts of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.090
 private channel I pass on a channel of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 channels it's not private channels 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.480
 here to chat with friends 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 most of the time it's been done since 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.629
 the chat interface but not in ffxiv 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.340
 and not because we are in a game that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 is still a little bit rp and so 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.399
 create channels from the interface 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.930
 would be a little bit of shit and and we're going 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.270
 use a network called the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.250
 linkshell here is the linkshell line like 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.539
 the scale link as the shellfish you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.860
 know the story what if we listen 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.660
 in a shell actually we heard 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.969
 we can communicate and personal 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 end of the world if I promise you is a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 legend like that so how does that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 pass and well that's it it's simple so 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 already it is here so in mine 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.390
 before any of the three capitals and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 is a p Spes small beads is 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.409
 go down we stay in the order of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.580
 shellfish in general it's not far from 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.070
 the place of summer rhyme is not always 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.460
 graded his guards galina guard in a way 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.460
 I can arrive 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.810
 witt gridania everything is fine in 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.170
 britannia it's no it's not at all 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.479
 same thing 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.800
 so you will talk to the NPC who sells 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.710
 the linkshell here it is called 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.240
 rather simple linkshell wanted to talk 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.010
 so if you want to join at lincoln 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.030
 you do not care is what it will take 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.770
 account but otherwise if you want to create 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.420
 renamed indicates shell or change of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.470
 chief 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.790
 this is where we are going to please 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.229
 click on it then you will follow 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.950
 instructions to create a new 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.380
 climate etc 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.580
 once it's done you have the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.930
 little mitchell school that has to 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.190
 appear the momentum down to the right and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 is called the image of a shell 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.060
 it's rather simple and there you have the s1 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.970
 and s2 and s3 the skates and 5 up to the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.890
 scooper suites up to 8 lynch she is 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.179
 so in these shell lines how does that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.150
 going on but you're commander if you 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.190
 just put it up and you just have to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.450
 from your friends list in network 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.650
 Social yes forward to our needs 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.510
 often real full of windows in 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.800
 this game you know right click 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.750
 about the people you have in your 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.550
 friends and you go the guests in 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.350
 the unique string number the number that 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.570
 are you interested in wanting to give a 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.739
 name like that it's healthier once 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.000
 that you invited him to appear there 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.959
 in 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.060
 and after you can possibly 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.680
 right click right on it for 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.690
 invite him into a group whispering to him 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.540
 send him requests from friends lections 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.080
 from the lean shell or even mount it if it's 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.730
 connected to but it's more me the boss 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.720
 so I can not finally do it right 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.070
 when you're commander we could 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.570
 right click on the person and 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.830
 increase it hf you give it your 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.090
 role of boss know that there may be 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.580
 that a line manager is therefore looking for a 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.890
 only person who can give the right 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.209
 to invite to other people so the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.470
 people that there is the person who cleans 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.480
 the young and the commander it is she who 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.910
 decide who can be chief and who 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.170
 heads there they have the power simply 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.510
 to invite other people into the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.829
 lynch she is pretty good 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.660
 one last thing the lynch she allows 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.070
 also to talk to a lot of people 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.480
 in one go for example by typing 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.340
 this is where we are on the links shell 1 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 so we will type the slash and leave a 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.730
 space and we will talk about them in a 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.200
 other technique if you always speak 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.510
 lingshan like me is to click on 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.280
 the little bubble there and to section 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.329
 lynch she's like that we do not write 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.060
 you are automatically in the group 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.010
 shell here and the lynch she is very 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.780
 convenient 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.370
 so we have not melted guild yet 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.640
 think there must be a channel of 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.810
 guÃ®nes 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.220
 but it's exciting in all cases 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.540
 if you have a group of friends with whom 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.849
 you play often you want to chat 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.019
 with them know if they are connected that 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.610
 it's but you have a big 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.379
 list of friends made more room all 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.790
 just here is create your lynch she 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.650
 you put the starches can have 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.700
 it costs nothing and it's the party and 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.049
 it allows to communicate with all 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.610
 world 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.290
