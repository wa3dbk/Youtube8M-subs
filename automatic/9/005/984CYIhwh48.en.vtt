00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.710
 at 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.970
 Moldovan fruit Russia way ordered 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.580
 Rospotrebnadzor of today 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.010
 temporarily limited the import of this product 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.500
 and now direct contact with the studio from 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.360
 Chisinau species comes out not two species 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.580
 Hello Moldavian manufacturers 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.580
 already estimated losses from these restrictions 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.890
 Hello Catherine Young still 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.650
 did not calculate possible losses these days 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.600
 authorities and manufacturers estimate the scale 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.810
 problems and looking for a way out 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.180
 however, and so clearly Russia was the most 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.010
 large buyers of Moldovan fruit 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.330
 only last year there was 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.700
 180 thousand tons of apples and 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.260
 50,000 tons of quality issues so far 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.690
 pore was not but after signing 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.150
 association agreements between moldova 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.900
 and from Moscow began to arrive first 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.250
 worries signals this month 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.799
 Rosselkhoznadzor returned to Moldova 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.320
 several tens of tons of apricots and here 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.590
 Today, a total ban on 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.189
 fruit and vegetable exports in Moldova 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.409
 this step is called purely political in 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:21.749
 We also have international agreements 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.299
 trade there are certain rules 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.100
 to be respected such cases 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.119
 if disturbed if there are any 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.149
 violations at the moment such such 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.670
 I receive general commissions 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.420
 evidence rushel is not available 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:44.429
 it shows quite fairly clearly 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.829
 something political moments to 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.390
 compensate for the loss of the Russian market 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.969
 authorities offer farmers 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.770
 reorient to the European Union quotas 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.799
 who got young after 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.200
 signing an association agreement with the EU 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.149
 many times less than previous volumes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.129
 export to russia besides 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.219
 meet European standards 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:07.469
 today only 15 percent are willing to farming 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.769
 manufacturers what to do next in 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.319
 Moldova has not yet know we do not have 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.049
 pretty clear plan of action 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.879
 what should we do in case we are not 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.440
 we can resume the export of Russian or 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.890
 since we understand that we must 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.019
 see pepper these markets understand that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.450
 there are alternative markets but rather 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.790
 difficult and difficult if we talk about 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.440
 gift items are mostly if 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.880
 I am fresh products it is mainly with us 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:41.970
 and the problem of marketing and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.040
 in the package and it turns out that the goods will remain 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.140
 homeland harvest this year one of 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.750
 best in the last 10 years and hardly 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.340
 the citizens of the young will be able to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 self master experts already 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.140
 now predicts due to oversupply 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.990
 fruit and vegetable prices are sharp 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.190
 will fall and that means that 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.860
 farmers will suffer even more 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.170
 losses what they will be in the price 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.900
 no expression is taken yet 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.420
 making alternatives could be 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.760
 processing but Russian control 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.070
 organs struck yet another blow they 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.650
 banned the export of Moldovan canning 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.510
 products in this case claims 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 related to product labeling 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.400
 Catherine thanks for a great view I will remind 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.560
 in direct connection with Chisinau 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.810
 dolgo Moldovan fruit experts found 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.600
 dangerous moth insect 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.510
 because of her products and quarantined 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.610
 moth is one of the most 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.980
 common agricultural pests this 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.680
 not a big gray butterfly at night she 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.380
 It lays its eggs in the fruit and then in 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.120
 fruit appear larvae moth 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.090
 likes to be populated in peach fruit 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.950
 apricot and apple will remind you that Russia 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.360
 second largest market for moldavians 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.240
 manufacturers as the newspaper reports 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.370
 statements for the European Union accounted for 46 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.370
 percent of exports to Russia 26
