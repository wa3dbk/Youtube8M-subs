could have got cranked on this map but
didn't<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
didn't really have time because is

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
didn't really have time because is
basically<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.489> whoever<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.210> at<00:00:45.480> the

limited<00:00:47.010> amount<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.809> anyways<00:00:48.809> we're

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
limited amount of time anyways we're

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
limited amount of time anyways we're
playing<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.620> PC<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> xbox<00:00:51.210> one

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
playing on PC with the xbox one

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
playing on PC with the xbox one
controller<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.530> I'll<00:00:52.800> talk<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.190> bit

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
controller so I'll talk a little bit

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
controller so I'll talk a little bit
about<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.730> controller<00:00:54.390> itself<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
about the controller itself I kind of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
about the controller itself I kind of
like<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.250> feels<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:56.730> good<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
like it it feels pretty good this the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
like it it feels pretty good this the
analog<00:00:57.989> sticks<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.680> small<00:00:58.920> compared

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
analog sticks are really small compared

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.819 
analog sticks are really small compared
to<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> X<00:00:59.760> regular<00:01:00.300> xbox<00:01:00.480> 360<00:01:01.079> controller<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to the X regular xbox 360 controller so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.380 
to the X regular xbox 360 controller so
maybe<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.100> changed<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
maybe I changed that a little bit the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.670 
maybe I changed that a little bit the
bumpers<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.930> triggers<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
bumpers and triggers you really have to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.429 
bumpers and triggers you really have to
get<00:01:04.830> used<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.760> honestly<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.110> enjoy

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
get used to but honestly I and I enjoy

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.780 
get used to but honestly I and I enjoy
pretty<00:01:07.650> much<00:01:07.770> everything<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.729> game

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pretty much everything about this game

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.410 
pretty much everything about this game
that<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> played<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.869> far<00:01:09.900> super<00:01:10.590> fast<00:01:10.770> paced

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
that I played so far super fast paced

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
that I played so far super fast paced
lots<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> action<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.770> move

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
lots of action going on you can move

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.830 
lots of action going on you can move
around<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> map<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> couple<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
around the map and you know a couple of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600 
around the map and you know a couple of
seconds<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.530> always<00:01:16.680> fun<00:01:16.950> bullets

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
seconds so that's always fun bullets

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.219 
seconds so that's always fun bullets
seem<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> connect<00:01:18.180> well<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.689> looks<00:01:19.020> absolutely

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
seem to connect well it looks absolutely

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.260 
seem to connect well it looks absolutely
beautiful<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.640> it'll<00:01:20.909> translate

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
beautiful so I think it'll translate

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530 
beautiful so I think it'll translate
well<00:01:21.600> over<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> xbox<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> 360<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
well over to the xbox one and 360 so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
well over to the xbox one and 360 so
mind<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.470> shot<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.460> think

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
mind my shot I don't have I don't think

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.179 
mind my shot I don't have I don't think
