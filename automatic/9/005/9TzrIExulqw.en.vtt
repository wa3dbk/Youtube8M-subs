00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello everyone in this video to teach 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.170
 how to knit the sheep point is a point 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.830
 that a bit pretty stable but that 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.009
 they are quite soft and put is called 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.560
 sheep point is quite soft and good 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.170
 the sheep's frescoes appear to the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 300 what does not therefore called so the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.019
 point I went for the weaving part of the fabric 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.050
 it looks a lot like its crossed draft 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.660
 but really the point I do know 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 form here in columns does not equal the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.110
 do the loop in another way and good 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 let's start good let's start 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.219
 with 15 points you have to know that in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.180
 that tip of a matter that they are even 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.120
 or odd points no matter what 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.610
 only thing that you have to have is the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 number of points plus two points of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 edge one at the beginning and another at the end 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.660
 well let's start knitting from the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.850
 first point in point of the right because 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.470
 we have just started 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.990
 and well I really said it is done in two 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.009
 rows and good the first row in 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.590
 only preparation that is knitting 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.570
 from reverse all the points we will knit 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 all points of the reverse point 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.810
 only for the part of the right in the 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.810
 first row we knit stitches 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.670
 The solidarity of this point is that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.730
 the right part of the fabric of the time and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.090
 on the reverse side we weave in point 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.429
 of the good right we end up 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.189
 the penultimate point of the order and the 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.149
 last on point of the right since it is 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.149
 edge point 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.170
 now for the reverse side of the fabric I said 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.270
 let's weave the point of the right and what 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.100
 what we are going to do is record 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.640
 the first point we will not leave it 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:15.010
 more is edge point and we will continue 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.180
 always with a loop before knitting 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.620
 next point emirates 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.620
 we make a loop 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.069
 the right of the sada is very important 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.609
 that you do not do it like that but below 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.650
 It is bottom - up do not do the 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.530
 top down it is very important that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.310
 be below 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.580
 and point of the right 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.270
 Red 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.110
 and so the whole row on the wrong side 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.110
 of the tissue 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.840
 until the penultimate point of the last 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.260
 point let's knit in right point 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.370
 since it is edge point good we give the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.220
 return 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.890
 and on the right side 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.670
 let's continue weaving in points of 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.240
 Alavese but two in the two points 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.930
 the time in point of nets again two 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.219
 points 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.219
 backhand point 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.849
 again 2 points points upside down 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.280
 so all the points the whole part 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.569
 right of the fabric minus the last point 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.719
 that you already know would be 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.719
 point sports on the right point 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.770
 in the last two points in total 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.220
 units 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.680
 and the last meeting of the right 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.740
 well this is the first and you will see 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.410
 You will see that they are forming is is 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.900
 forming the stitch we will give the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.540
 back and let's continue doing 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.090
 absolutely the same for the part of the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.669
 reverse of the fabric from the bottom up 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.130
 and we have a right point below 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.750
 up right point first 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.210
 As we wrap the needle is very 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.300
 important 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.860
 if you do it is if you do not know the stitch 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.849
 you have to do it like that 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.849
 and with we 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.129
 and look at the last point always if in the 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.499
 room 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.830
 we protect the point of the right only 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:13.220
 we turn 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.740
 the first point without knitting and we continue 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.310
 of 2 in 2 2 points 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.900
 together theatrical points to 32 points 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.770
 together 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.229
 in dollars point and so we finish the 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.560
 row and those are the two lines that are 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:35.100
 repeat on all laps 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.130
 and well that's how the point is 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.990
 quite soft as pretty stamen 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.510
 It is advisable that you always do it 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.320
 with the needles that correspond to the 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.630
 wool what you put on the label 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.160
 good for the backhand part I told you 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:56.300
 it looks a lot like the cross point 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.990
 to the point crossed openwork but good 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.560
 they do not really come out 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.580
 the two equal points 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.830
 and on the right side because the curls of 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.080
 a sheep I hope you liked it and 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.200
 thank you very much for watching the video 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.200
 then
