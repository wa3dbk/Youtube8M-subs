00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.080
 orcs and men from the cia nied studios 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.610
 those are the makers of blood bowl and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 the cult game game of thrones 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 one of these titles would not be that way 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.710
 right on the screen 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.630
 while the action role-playing promises 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 through some interesting approaches too 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 a real genre secret tip off 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 to advance from skyrim twitter and co 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.240
 if it only stays with the promise 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.590
 we clarify in our test video then yes 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 already let time to the game 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 ever and people are growing up 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.280
 tells of the orca wedge and his 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.960
 Kompagnon piece taken a little 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.370
 the two were commissioned the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.230
 to turn off human imperator 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 he did not want to do anything better than 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 to enslave all that green today 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.149
 but as it soon turns out that is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.430
 Attentats mission 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.960
 Uphill vagueness and piece 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.149
 meet more during your trip 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.149
 traitor and intrigue as somehow 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.449
 the story is of such in the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 interspaces pushed forward in 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.870
 which we are typical of the genre too 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.850
 may choose some answer yourself 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.439
 unlike dragon age or mass 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.119
 effect did not say that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.340
 impact on the conversation or the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 quest progress through but is one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.770
 round three 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.640
 You've learned to kill me 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.350
 Also annoying the developers 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 do not use the potential of your figure 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.710
 from as we have times a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.390
 coarse haudrauf place with 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.340
 Aggressive problem on the one hand 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.840
 and text the cleverly cunning 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 rogue gnome on the other 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 actually the ideal constellation 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 Expulsion or humor how to get it out 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.520
 buddy movies knows but far from it 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 the two are going on an adventure in the story 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.119
 rather next to each other and hardly go 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.170
 each other or their problems 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.970
 one another 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 and then it's time for a conflict 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 he comes back shortly thereafter 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.439
 settled a pity because with more 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 fingertip while writing the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.619
 history we would have it here with two 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
 memorable roleplaying characters 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.430
 had so degenerate akerlund 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.479
 piece to simple decal in her 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.979
 breed without great deep pity a pity 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.810
 because there is no militia less 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.439
 should be with those in my wise 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.439
 climb 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.740
 Wedge and sticks we draw from the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.600
 Shoulder perspective through 3d 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 landscapes are allowed at any time 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.390
 between place and gnome by keystroke 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.069
 switch back and forth 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.630
 that is necessary because the two have 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.910
 different crafts 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.440
 Sixx can be almost invisible 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.209
 make and go unnoticed by enemies 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.280
 stalk around them with a jab 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.020
 through silently off part of his 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.790
 however, the typus is global with it 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.390
 big clubs or lizard neat 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.890
 crushes his opponent thanks to his 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.810
 strong arms can even stick 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.400
 Vorsprge throw so that there eg 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.890
 can turn off the crossbowmen 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.420
 so not achieved despite this 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.769
 mighty abilities is of orcs and 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.930
 not an easy game 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.880
 on the contrary, because who believes in that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.220
 invisible piece of half- army silent 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.230
 to be able to retrieve the wrong it comes to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.670
 open battle we have the choice could 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.030
 with the two greens today in real time 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.010
 on it or and now comes the clou 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.299
 we switch the pause mode to rest 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.070
 to issue orders 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.870
 they are divided into various sections 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.940
 and cover pretty much everything you can 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.549
 is used to single role play 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.400
 violent lever and envelopes remote battle 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.840
 anesthetic et cetera pp up to four 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.280
 Attacks we can string together 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.030
 the heroes then automatically 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.860
 To run 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.450
 not even aim we have to arg 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.420
 a piece turn on its own 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.890
 First of all, best goal already on the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.359
 second of the four difficulty levels 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.040
 the battles are pretty tricky and 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.510
 require the well timed use of the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 talents that's good 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.290
 good also that the other one keeps that in the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.780
 moment is taken over by the ki right 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.489
 Clever acting is less good that the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.019
 a bit fumbling 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.400
 and that the fighting comparatively um 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.109
 the amish are staged 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.780
 we know that from the witcher 2 far 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.250
 better genre typical collect the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.329
 Experiences we at stages on 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.850
 climbed into the four character values 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.390
 strength agility and spirit 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.310
 stick 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.440
 In addition, we may at certain level 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.269
 ups new talents distribute pieces learn 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.380
 or existing in two special 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.720
 improve areas 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.730
 But that was already motivated 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.590
 everything is a roleplaying game in of orcs 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.030
 and men is everything else 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.730
 this genre also makes it so 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.040
 we miss the painful here 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.840
 Exploration about all levels 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.459
 namely, such a small tube I 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.979
 from that even mass effect 3 like a 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.659
 second skyrim acts as a proof 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.520
 I give you the map and this is 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.620
 another of the more extensive areas 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.539
 the bad thing is not there yet 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.370
 something to discover here at the current 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.930
 straight through a catacomb and look 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.610
 whether off the main path maybe 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.710
 a box with stuff inside it 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.710
 But what is not there? 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.610
 ok second try here behind this 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.410
 corner must be something 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.919
 but just look round there 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.880
 not even something to guard 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.560
 that is a pity because we have 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.910
 already like more on the items 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.010
 tinkered with our two heroes 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.870
 but if you hardly find any then yes 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.419
 falls just a big motivation motor 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.950
 away also gives away nextquest 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.060
 off the main action we can 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.500
 count off one hand 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.360
 besides, they do not fall very much 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.010
 innovative from here we should go to 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.330
 Example in succession with all fighters 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.760
 the rebels of the so-called black ones 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.300
 hand over to prove us what 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.680
 really duell is duell duell and to 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.050
 finish a duel again 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.729
 so on oxman constantly leaves the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.950
 impression of well meant but not good 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.050
 unfortunately, that made a lot of the game 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.050
 of its inherent potential costs 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.639
 technically, the game is also 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.380
 do not look over the intersection though 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.090
 the characters quite handsome 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.220
 off and the textures are almost 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.780
 invariably crisp hot the general 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.460
 polygon poverty of the environment is but 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.840
 anything but timely and robs the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.460
 play a lot of atmosphere 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.110
 this also applies to the lighting and 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.550
 the animations of the figures are 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.860
 Although not bad, too 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.510
 not very good annoying 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.250
 occasional bugs like when ki-opponents 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.930
 strange ways find it problems 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.550
 to lay the day or not to meet 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.229
 let it hang because it helped in the wall 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.229
 there developers should ran again 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.169
 We wanted to call again and again at the test 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.090
 also about the giving away potential 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.009
 it is the story of the main characters or 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.210
 the quests also the consistent 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.560
 world attracts us because of his 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.419
 manageability and the missing 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.870
 Discover joy not just good in the 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.430
 game 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.780
 after all, they are tactical 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.340
 inspired bouts fun and that 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.650
 Interplay between arg in one piece 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.509
 motivated for in between is of orcs 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.039
 and men so a good genre 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.110
 alternative so much roleplay 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:30.639
 But they should be different than the title 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.639
 can not expect to be suspected
