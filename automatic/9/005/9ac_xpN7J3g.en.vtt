just<00:00:35.440> kind<00:00:35.649> of<00:00:35.770> make<00:00:36.039> it<00:00:36.219> made<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:36.640> up<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.000> put

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
just kind of make it made it up and put

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.270 
just kind of make it made it up and put
on<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.360> website<00:00:37.560> not<00:00:38.560> that<00:00:38.739> I'm<00:00:38.860> not<00:00:39.040> saying

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
on the website not that I'm not saying

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.010 
on the website not that I'm not saying
that<00:00:39.520> if<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.850> want<00:00:40.060> YouTube<00:00:40.450> will<00:00:40.690> do<00:00:40.810> that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
that if you want YouTube will do that

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.490 
that if you want YouTube will do that
but<00:00:41.550> sometimes<00:00:42.550> I'm<00:00:42.940> slightly<00:00:43.810> skeptical

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
but sometimes I'm slightly skeptical

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.270 
but sometimes I'm slightly skeptical
about<00:00:44.950> some<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.670> application<00:00:46.390> techniques

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
about some of the application techniques

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.549 
about some of the application techniques
so<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.310> thought<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.610> know<00:00:48.820> getting<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.600> book<00:00:50.290> or

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
so I thought you know getting a book or

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.610 
so I thought you know getting a book or
two<00:00:50.860> will<00:00:51.820> actually<00:00:52.149> help<00:00:52.360> validate<00:00:52.780> some<00:00:53.440> of

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
two will actually help validate some of

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.220 
two will actually help validate some of
the<00:00:53.710> things<00:00:53.950> I<00:00:54.100> see<00:00:54.370> on<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.640> web<00:00:54.989> most<00:00:55.989> of<00:00:56.170> the

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
the things I see on the web most of the

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.410 
the things I see on the web most of the
time<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.739> does<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.520> early<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:57.940> he's<00:00:58.180> both<00:00:58.390> of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
time it does that early and he's both of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.750 
time it does that early and he's both of
these<00:00:58.570> possibilities<00:00:59.350> here<00:00:59.829> they<00:01:00.700> do

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
these possibilities here they do

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.850 
these possibilities here they do
validate<00:01:01.450> what<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.660> see<00:01:01.750> on<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.020> web<00:01:02.200> I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
validate what I see on the web I

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.619

between<00:01:04.980> book<00:01:05.980> and<00:01:06.340> what<00:01:06.870> so<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:09.070> means<00:01:09.220> most

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
between book and what so that means most

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.160 
between book and what so that means most
YouTube<00:01:09.790> viewer<00:01:10.030> but<00:01:10.330> most<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:10.780> YouTube
