that I want to do is I'm gonna take what

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.720 
that I want to do is I'm gonna take what
I've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.650> fold<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.160> down<00:01:23.190> and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
I've got here and fold it down and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.940 
I've got here and fold it down and
actually<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.320> quite<00:01:25.500> fold<00:01:25.800> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
actually you don't want to quite fold it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
actually you don't want to quite fold it
all<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.190> way<00:01:26.370> down<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.940> bottom<00:01:27.390> part

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
all the way down to this bottom part

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
all the way down to this bottom part
ideally<00:01:28.470> what<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.010> do<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> fold<00:01:29.460> down

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
ideally what we want to do is fold down

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.250 
ideally what we want to do is fold down
1/3<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
1/3 of the way you can kind of

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.530 
1/3 of the way you can kind of
guesstimate<00:01:31.890> where<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.460> by<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.210> gently

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
guesstimate where that is by just gently

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.360 
guesstimate where that is by just gently
folding<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.800> folding<00:01:35.220> this

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
folding this down and then folding this

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.860 
folding this down and then folding this
up<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.730> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> seen<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.480> would<00:01:36.659> kind

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
up and kind of seen if they would kind

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.910 
up and kind of seen if they would kind
of<00:01:36.930> line<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.409> together<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:40.380> if

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
of line up together or not I think if

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
of line up together or not I think if
you<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> give<00:01:41.550> yourself<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.360> room

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you kind of give yourself a little room

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.320 
you kind of give yourself a little room
here<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.440> kind<00:01:43.650> of<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:44.150> where<00:01:45.150> that

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
here you can kind of see where that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.420 
here you can kind of see where that
might<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.080> doesn't<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.650> exact<00:01:47.040> but

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
might be it doesn't have to be exact but

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
might be it doesn't have to be exact but
we're<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.820> gonna<00:01:48.120> give<00:01:48.960> yourself<00:01:49.080> about

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
we're just gonna give yourself about

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.070 
we're just gonna give yourself about
maybe<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.010> centimeter<00:01:50.400> down<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.840> where

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
maybe a centimeter down there from where

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.380 
maybe a centimeter down there from where
you're<00:01:52.229> gonna<00:01:52.350> fold<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:52.970> make<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> crease

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you're gonna fold down make the crease

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.450 
you're gonna fold down make the crease
and<00:01:54.900> then<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.650> go<00:01:55.770> ahead<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.010> open<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.310> up

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and then just go ahead and open it up

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.000 
and then just go ahead and open it up
and<00:01:56.760> then<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.750> gonna<00:01:57.900> take<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.560> part<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
and then I'm gonna take this part and

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.250 
and then I'm gonna take this part and
fold<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.400> back<00:01:59.729> now<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.510> distance<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
fold it back now the distance I want to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.340 
fold it back now the distance I want to
fold<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.560> back<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.310> third<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.450> red<00:02:04.020> edge

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
fold it back is a third of this red edge

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.500 
fold it back is a third of this red edge
that<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.970> you<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.299> what

that you see here and if you want what
you<00:02:06.540> could<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.229> kind<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.470> curl<00:02:07.860> this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you could do is just kind of curl this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.110 
you could do is just kind of curl this
around<00:02:08.549> for<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.849> second<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.599> S<00:02:09.869> shape<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
around for a second make an S shape and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.970 
around for a second make an S shape and
try<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.290> equal

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
try to get it so that you get equal

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.360 
try to get it so that you get equal
parts<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:15.209> three<00:02:15.569> parts<00:02:15.930> here

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
parts for all three parts here

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.670 
parts for all three parts here
and<00:02:16.459> then<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.269> smush<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.659> down<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
and then kind of just smush it down to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440 
and then kind of just smush it down to
give<00:02:18.799> yourself<00:02:19.159> a<00:02:19.250> little<00:02:19.370> pinch<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.060> this

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
give yourself a little pinch and this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.119 
give yourself a little pinch and this
top<00:02:20.780> pinch<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.349> one<00:02:21.500> we're<00:02:21.620> gonna<00:02:21.680> use<00:02:21.799> as

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
top pinch is the one we're gonna use as

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.800 
top pinch is the one we're gonna use as
a<00:02:22.250> guide<00:02:22.430> I'm<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.819> fold<00:02:23.030> back<00:02:23.360> from<00:02:23.659> that

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
a guide I'm going to fold back from that

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.869 
a guide I'm going to fold back from that
and<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.069> really<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> guideline

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879

just so you get a nice balanced shape be

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.800 
just so you get a nice balanced shape be
it<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.489> take<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.849> part<00:02:29.150> too<00:02:29.330> seriously

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
it on to take this part too seriously

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.360 
it on to take this part too seriously
we're<00:02:30.409> going<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.590> fold<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.890> little<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
we're going to fold a little of that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.509 
we're going to fold a little of that
back<00:02:31.640> though<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.390> get<00:02:33.129> something<00:02:34.129> like

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
where this flap lays against that crease

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.910 
where this flap lays against that crease
that<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.540> made<00:02:44.780> back<00:02:45.019> there<00:02:45.260> behind<00:02:45.440> everything

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that I made back there behind everything

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.460 
that I made back there behind everything
I'm<00:02:46.579> gonna<00:02:46.730> take<00:02:46.909> my<00:02:47.060> scissors<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.480> I'm<00:02:48.260> just

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470

I'm gonna take my scissors and I'm just
gonna<00:02:48.590> cut<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.099> little<00:02:49.310> notch<00:02:49.609> into<00:02:50.450> each<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
gonna cut a little notch into each of

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.270 
gonna cut a little notch into each of
these<00:02:51.079> sides<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:51.709> kind<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:51.920> come<00:02:52.129> at

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
these sides so you can kind of come at

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.309 
these sides so you can kind of come at
it<00:02:52.430> from<00:02:52.549> an<00:02:52.670> angle<00:02:52.790> just<00:02:53.209> kind<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.079> cut<00:02:54.290> down

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
it from an angle just kind of cut down

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.349 
it from an angle just kind of cut down
to<00:02:54.769> where<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:54.950> creases<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.910> behind

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
to where that creases and behind

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.630 
to where that creases and behind
everything<00:02:56.690> let's<00:02:57.440> do<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.920> little<00:02:58.340> one<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.519> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
everything let's do a little one in the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.880 
everything let's do a little one in the
front<00:02:58.940> two<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.079> I'm<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.349> going<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.530> do<00:03:00.739> this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
front two and I'm just going to do this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.190 
front two and I'm just going to do this
for<00:03:01.190> both<00:03:01.220> sides<00:03:01.670> here

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.250 

so<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.370> can<00:03:10.490> get<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.670> little<00:03:10.849> bit<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.390> those

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
so that we can get a little bit of those

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.880 
so that we can get a little bit of those
little<00:03:12.650> notches<00:03:12.860> cut<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.640> either<00:03:13.849> side<00:03:14.890> then

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
little notches cut on either side then

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.130 
little notches cut on either side then
I'm<00:03:16.340> gonna<00:03:16.550> go<00:03:16.790> ahead<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.390> kind<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.810> open

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
I'm gonna go ahead and kind of open

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.530 
I'm gonna go ahead and kind of open
things<00:03:18.349> up<00:03:18.500> for<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.800> second<00:03:19.220> fold<00:03:20.000> everything

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
things up for a second fold everything

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.630 
things up for a second fold everything
in<00:03:20.840> half<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.560> still<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.190> crease

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
in half and I still have this crease

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.000 
in half and I still have this crease
that<00:03:22.849> runs<00:03:22.910> right<00:03:23.300> here<00:03:23.569> I<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.770> go<00:03:24.890> ahead

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
that runs right here I want to go ahead

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.830 
that runs right here I want to go ahead
and<00:03:25.220> kind<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.819> looking<00:03:26.090> at<00:03:26.239> what<00:03:26.390> I've<00:03:26.510> got<00:03:26.540> up

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
and kind of looking at what I've got up

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.240 
and kind of looking at what I've got up
here<00:03:26.870> too<00:03:27.440> I'm<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.220> gonna<00:03:28.310> cut<00:03:28.850> on<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.900> edge

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
here too I'm just gonna cut on the edge

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.160 
here too I'm just gonna cut on the edge
through<00:03:31.250> all<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.580> layers<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.750> want<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.020> make

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
through all the layers you want to make

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.809 
through all the layers you want to make
sure<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.560> cut<00:03:33.800> far<00:03:34.130> enough<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.670> you're

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
sure you cut far enough that you're

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.780 
sure you cut far enough that you're
going<00:03:35.000> farther<00:03:35.420> than<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:36.410> little<00:03:37.220> edges

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
going farther than this little edges

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.330 
going farther than this little edges
here<00:03:38.120> go<00:03:38.989> ahead<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.170> open<00:03:39.349> everything<00:03:39.709> up<00:03:40.010> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
here go ahead and open everything up and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.270 
here go ahead and open everything up and
then<00:03:41.090> we're<00:03:41.209> just<00:03:41.239> gonna<00:03:41.510> take<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.290> tuck<00:03:42.860> this

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
then we're just gonna take and tuck this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.330 
then we're just gonna take and tuck this
tip<00:03:43.700> into<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.780> little<00:03:45.019> creased<00:03:45.650> area<00:03:46.160> we've

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
tip into that little creased area we've

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.490 
tip into that little creased area we've
made<00:03:46.550> here<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:47.390> just<00:03:47.569> slide<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.989> in<00:03:48.049> it

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
made here so just slide that in it

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.800 
made here so just slide that in it
should<00:03:48.739> go<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:49.130> there<00:03:49.280> nice<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:50.030> hide<00:03:50.690> away

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
should go in there nice and hide away

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.590 
should go in there nice and hide away
the<00:03:50.930> way<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.230> should<00:03:52.090> then<00:03:53.090> I'm<00:03:53.239> gonna<00:03:53.360> go

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
the way it should then I'm gonna go

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.750 
the way it should then I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.989> make<00:03:54.140> another<00:03:54.350> Chris<00:03:54.950> set<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.430> cuts

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
ahead and make another Chris set of cuts

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.850 
ahead and make another Chris set of cuts
and<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.360> time<00:03:56.720> I'm<00:03:56.900> gonna<00:03:57.049> go<00:03:57.230> ahead<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.440> cut

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and this time I'm gonna go ahead and cut

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.229 
and this time I'm gonna go ahead and cut
from<00:03:58.730> down<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.660> all<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.470> way<00:04:00.620> up<00:04:00.860> to<00:04:01.489> that

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
from down here all the way up to that

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.350 
from down here all the way up to that
creased<00:04:02.720> edge<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:04.000> sometimes<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.239> gonna

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
creased edge and sometimes this is gonna

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.580 
creased edge and sometimes this is gonna
be<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.510> little<00:04:05.750> tricky<00:04:06.080> because<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.410> don't

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
be a little tricky because you don't

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.930 
be a little tricky because you don't
want<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.799> accidentally<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.519> know<00:04:07.549> get<00:04:07.819> this

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
want to accidentally you know get this

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.570 
want to accidentally you know get this
weird<00:04:08.330> edge<00:04:09.200> because<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.340> way<00:04:10.430> you're

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
weird edge because of the way you're

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.850 
weird edge because of the way you're
cutting<00:04:10.940> things<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.510> can<00:04:11.569> kind<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:11.959> open

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
cutting things so you can kind of open

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.550 
cutting things so you can kind of open
things<00:04:13.100> up<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.609> helps<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.109> little<00:04:15.410> easy

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
things up if it helps it's a little easy

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.659 
things up if it helps it's a little easy
to<00:04:15.940> accidentally<00:04:18.010> get<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.070> little<00:04:19.370> bit<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.579> an

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
to accidentally get a little bit of an

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.940 
to accidentally get a little bit of an
edge<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.150> but<00:04:20.450> it's<00:04:20.570> not<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:21.410> too<00:04:21.650> big<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.799> a

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
edge on it but it's not not too big of a

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:32.900 
edge on it but it's not not too big of a
deal<00:04:22.130> if<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.370> do

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.550 

we'll<00:04:33.910> do<00:04:34.090> this<00:04:34.210> for<00:04:34.450> both<00:04:34.480> sides<00:04:34.660> when<00:04:35.230> we<00:04:35.350> cut

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
we'll do this for both sides when we cut

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.510 
we'll do this for both sides when we cut
back<00:04:35.800> there<00:04:37.620> after<00:04:38.620> getting<00:04:38.919> both<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.220> those

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
back there after getting both of those

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.760 
back there after getting both of those
sides<00:04:39.880> cut<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:40.510> either<00:04:40.750> side<00:04:41.169> I'm<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
sides cut on either side I'm going to

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.980 
sides cut on either side I'm going to
take<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.220> top<00:04:42.430> section<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.060> fold<00:04:43.389> down<00:04:43.540> and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
take the top section and fold down and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.290 
take the top section and fold down and
when<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.230> do<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.950> want<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.550> kind<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.760> open<00:04:45.940> up

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
when I do I want to kind of open up

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.540 
when I do I want to kind of open up
these<00:04:46.690> areas<00:04:47.320> here<00:04:47.800> let<00:04:49.200> this<00:04:50.200> part<00:04:50.740> stick<00:04:51.370> up

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
these areas here let this part stick up

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.000 
these areas here let this part stick up
from<00:04:51.970> underneath<00:04:52.530> so<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> nice<00:04:53.980> little

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
from underneath so I get a nice little

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.970 
from underneath so I get a nice little
section<00:04:54.610> there<00:04:54.639> for<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.090> head<00:04:55.710> now<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.889> I've

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
section there for the head now that I've

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.650 
section there for the head now that I've
got<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.160> head<00:04:57.520> part<00:04:57.790> sticking<00:04:58.120> out<00:04:58.360> I'm<00:04:58.600> just

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
got that head part sticking out I'm just

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.390 
got that head part sticking out I'm just
gonna<00:04:58.870> kind<00:04:59.200> of<00:04:59.260> open<00:04:59.740> things<00:04:59.950> up<00:05:00.100> for<00:05:00.160> a

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
gonna kind of open things up for a

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.830 
gonna kind of open things up for a
second<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.440> take<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.830> top<00:05:03.280> layer<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.450> go

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
second and take this top layer and go

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.960 
second and take this top layer and go
ahead<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.200> cut<00:05:05.530> along<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:05.979> crease<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.910> you

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
ahead and cut along that crease that you

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.320 
ahead and cut along that crease that you
see<00:05:07.450> here<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.590> we're<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.740> gonna<00:05:09.430> cut<00:05:09.820> until

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
see here and we're just gonna cut until

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.840 
see here and we're just gonna cut until
it<00:05:10.450> almost<00:05:10.690> close<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.889> other<00:05:12.070> crease<00:05:12.610> we

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
it almost close to the other crease we

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.640 
it almost close to the other crease we
made<00:05:13.060> just<00:05:13.270> make<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:13.990> mean<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.260> other<00:05:14.380> cut

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
made just make I mean the other cut

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.960 
made just make I mean the other cut
excuse<00:05:15.070> me<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.310> want<00:05:15.400> make<00:05:15.580> sure<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:15.850> don't

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
excuse me you want make sure you don't

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.740 
excuse me you want make sure you don't
cut<00:05:16.210> too<00:05:16.389> far<00:05:16.419> because<00:05:17.320> then<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.740> will

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
cut too far because then you will

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.540 
cut too far because then you will
basically<00:05:19.750> remove<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.680> whole<00:05:20.889> section<00:05:21.220> you

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
basically remove that whole section you

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.010 
basically remove that whole section you
just<00:05:21.760> want<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:21.940> cut<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.270> little<00:05:22.570> bit<00:05:22.750> and

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
just want to cut in a little bit and

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.900 
just want to cut in a little bit and
then<00:05:23.500> we're<00:05:23.680> going<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.950> go<00:05:24.130> ahead<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.669> take

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
then we're going to go ahead and take

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.360 
then we're going to go ahead and take
this<00:05:25.150> part<00:05:25.510> here<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.020> fold<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:26.950> that<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.220> edge

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
this part here and fold so that the edge

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.830 
this part here and fold so that the edge
goes<00:05:27.880> towards<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.690> center<00:05:29.430> crease<00:05:30.430> here<00:05:30.840> do

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
goes towards the center crease here do

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.240 
goes towards the center crease here do
the<00:05:31.930> same<00:05:32.140> thing<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.650> side<00:05:35.160> it's<00:05:36.160> only

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
the same thing on this side it's only
