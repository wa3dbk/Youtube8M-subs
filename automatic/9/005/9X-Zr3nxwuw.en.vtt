00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 problem in this artifact is that being 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:17.090
 used to keep it in bad use or to put it wrong 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.870
 the pieces then it has been valued 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.740
 in this case for example 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.100
 when investing or when changing the pieces as 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.710
 another to give it a different use 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.920
 then this affects this artifact 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.150
 failed and then the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.320
 pins and pins when it would break 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.690
 they can not use anymore because 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.630
 do 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.300
 in this case, for example, when misusing 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.649
 when putting these 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.120
 these pieces broke in this case this 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.360
 part 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.510
 here is a pin this pin was broken 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.630
 so 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.900
 when entering there 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.830
 this 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.830
 the piece 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.180
 this causes the internal switch to be 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.860
 activate when raising this lever to the rise 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.110
 this lever up then 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.869
 Suisse is activated and by breaking this pin 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.140
 then he has no more to lift and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.380
 that only worked or worked 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 then the blender is not 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.080
 but they did not do the other functions anymore 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.160
 they did not work 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.160
 then you would have to put the other 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.310
 pin or adjust it because these pieces 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.310
 there is nowhere with this 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.560
 Argentine publication then that 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.800
 I had to adapt it and now it's 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.860
 fully functioning already then we are going to 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.300
 start to arm 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 this high when then that's the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.119
 problem that many of us do not 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.550
 we know how to do it well or we do not use it 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.150
 or suddenly we do not talk about reading the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.710
 catalog and therefore we have 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.990
 failed and once wrong now there was 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.470
 none of the pieces serve after 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.980
 that could work or be good is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.320
 the blender part in this case 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.260
 only this error this one no longer the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.040
 blender the cutter and others 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.459
 Elements no longer works then 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.390
 to make good use of these artifacts there 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.390
 to read them 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.739
 you have to talk coming 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.040
 manufacturer's specifications 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.500
 way we will obviate many problems 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.099
 this is all for today friends will be up 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.099
 the next
