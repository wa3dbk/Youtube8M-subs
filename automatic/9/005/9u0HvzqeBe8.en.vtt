 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.270
 found today on redd for a 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.830
 practice is downright fast 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.160
 hide me it's a whole 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.960
 so when I said on redd I'm at 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.400
 comfortable late is a class that I have 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.540
 not at all used to playing in 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.730
 France a weapon that I have not at all 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.680
 used to play sorry why I 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.460
 the cheek because actually managed are 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.559
 very last time 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.879
 basically to tell you the story in 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.350
 in short I was an account 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.730
 I claim to have lent my account 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.489
 a friend who had more subscriptions 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.210
 alive him he participates kemo enemies 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.250
 ratio is so I told myself must 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.079
 break point I'm full he's ready 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.890
 larcher is often enough for fun 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.530
 like that because I see no interest 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.120
 to go up to prestige max so I'm coming 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.829
 is a give one last time the me 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.680
 am told one last time to during a 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.399
 strike two months before posts go hop 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.440
 Let's go 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.790
 and suddenly badly manage this and suddenly 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.580
 I ended up with them the classes 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.350
 rotten from the beginning the scorpion and 27.1 a 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.330
 little drunk since after as low as 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.930
 kits to test ArdÃ¨che vases 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.630
 new weapons 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.760
 so many men that I not with 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.320
 which I'm not used to playing and 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.360
 suddenly I find myself the game more 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.640
 late and frankly I have a lot 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.960
 enjoyed this tree and I do not regret the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.430
 while having a neck head because 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.290
 it allowed me the end of the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.409
 discover and I think you're going 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.159
 see upcoming next gameplay 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.170
 with this weapon because it's worth the detour 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.850
 frankly and less to make big 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.659
 parties with with so loves them so much 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.530
 we're not here to talk to 100 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:58.360
 most beautiful meadows made then top 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.290
 this paper also so brief i'm 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.979
 working on episode 5 6 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.950
 and 7 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.780
 so three episodes at the same time or 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.979
 am I exactly right 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.980
 episode 6 to 7 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.209
 they are written entirely and there you 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.160
 tell me why you're not going out 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.190
 not so well because in fact 6 and 7 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 are written but not the episode 5 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.600
 and if I am the sky this advance 5 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.450
 you will not understand the story of the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.300
 kick off the job on the simple there 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.860
 I will finish writing it I think from here 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.170
 little since I finish the job 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.239
 Wednesday night it's Sunday where I 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.160
 So you recommend Wednesday night I 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.630
 are going to finish working and after that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.430
 I have two three weeks before 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.510
 resumption of quiet courts where I 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.819
 where could I possibly 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.590
 can work on a video 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.940
 quietly and make you a little 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.440
 nice video 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.260
 besides there will be a new project 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.450
 also that will soon arrive with 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.530
 some members of my team including oxides 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.910
 ghost and nil oxide so here I hope 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.280
 that it will be a project that goes a lot 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.040
 we like it because my opinion it will be worth 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.820
 the detour also always on the fun 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.769
 and humor 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.910
 so here are these little projects there I know 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.359
 that you love them so much so bah 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.070

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.829
