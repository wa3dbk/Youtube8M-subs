00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.430 
neatly and it's it's not it's the stuff
that<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.580> combination<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.810> all<00:04:32.140> of<00:04:32.200> the

that it's the combination of all of the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
its kind of genetic sound it's the DNA

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.500 
its kind of genetic sound it's the DNA
of<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.560> sound<00:04:41.890> so<00:04:42.580> if<00:04:42.700> you're<00:04:42.850> working<00:04:43.060> on<00:04:43.390> it

of it sound so if you're working on it

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.540 
of it sound so if you're working on it
how's<00:04:44.080> are<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.470> working<00:04:44.770> with<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.920> very<00:04:45.190> thick

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
how's are you working with a very thick

the bridge mahogany neck these are

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.230 
the bridge mahogany neck these are
things<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.000> don't<00:04:52.570> really<00:04:53.910> show<00:04:54.910> if<00:04:55.150> you

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
things that don't really show if you

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.230 
things that don't really show if you
just<00:04:55.450> take<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.600> picture<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.260> guitar<00:04:57.240> it

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
just take a picture in the guitar it

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.960 
just take a picture in the guitar it
takes<00:04:58.600> getting<00:04:59.050> into<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.680> to<00:05:00.370> find<00:05:00.400> out<00:05:00.790> oh

this is going to make something that has

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
look at a Torres and in some ways it's

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.290 
look at a Torres and in some ways it's
built<00:05:13.990> very<00:05:14.170> freely<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:15.040> very<00:05:15.280> easily<00:05:15.580> it's

not like a Howser at all it looks like
one<00:05:18.700> but<00:05:19.180> it's<00:05:19.360> not<00:05:19.540> built<00:05:19.930> like<00:05:20.020> one<00:05:20.410> at<00:05:20.530> all

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680

its thin its arched it's you know very
simply<00:05:26.380> put<00:05:26.620> together<00:05:26.910> but<00:05:27.910> but<00:05:28.480> kind<00:05:28.780> of

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
simply put together but but kind of

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.020 
simply put together but but kind of
perfect<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.530> elegant<00:05:30.040> him<00:05:30.220> in<00:05:30.490> every<00:05:31.000> way

perfect and elegant him in every way

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.510 
perfect and elegant him in every way
that<00:05:31.780> produces<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.350> whole<00:05:32.620> different<00:05:33.190> kind<00:05:33.370> of

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
that produces a whole different kind of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.140 
that produces a whole different kind of
sound<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.020> was<00:05:35.170> both<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.620> marketing<00:05:36.220> idea<00:05:36.610> of

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
sound so it was both a marketing idea of

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.110 
sound so it was both a marketing idea of
being<00:05:37.810> able<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.160> present<00:05:39.160> instruments<00:05:40.030> that

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
being able to present instruments that

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.680 
being able to present instruments that
had<00:05:40.300> different<00:05:40.690> characteristic<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:42.390> it<00:05:43.390> was

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
had different characteristic and it was

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.350 
had different characteristic and it was
also<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.470> kind<00:05:45.400> of<00:05:45.640> a<00:05:46.980> course<00:05:47.980> of<00:05:48.280> study<00:05:48.340> for<00:05:49.090> me

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
also a kind of a course of study for me

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.560 
also a kind of a course of study for me
as<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.660> builder<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:51.220> try<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:51.550> do<00:05:51.880> all<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.270> these

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
as a builder to try to do all of these

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.550 
as a builder to try to do all of these
things<00:05:52.630> not<00:05:53.380> just<00:05:54.630> kind<00:05:55.630> of<00:05:55.750> clothes<00:05:56.260> but

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
things not just kind of clothes but

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.500 
things not just kind of clothes but
trying<00:05:56.830> to<00:05:56.860> get<00:05:57.040> as<00:05:57.130> detailed<00:05:57.700> as<00:05:58.090> they<00:05:58.240> could

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
trying to get as detailed as they could

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.560 
trying to get as detailed as they could
and<00:05:58.690> learn<00:05:59.380> what<00:05:59.620> I<00:05:59.680> could<00:06:00.040> from<00:06:00.570> following

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
and learn what I could from following

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.430 
and learn what I could from following
the<00:06:02.200> footsteps<00:06:02.680> of<00:06:03.100> these<00:06:03.310> old<00:06:03.490> Lister's<00:06:04.440> so

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
the footsteps of these old Lister's so

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.690 
the footsteps of these old Lister's so
when<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.620> make<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:05.830> when<00:06:06.310> you<00:06:06.400> started

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
when you make that when you started

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.310 
when you make that when you started
making<00:06:06.910> these<00:06:07.000> are<00:06:07.480> you<00:06:07.570> trying<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:07.870> replicate

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
making these are you trying to replicate

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.260 
making these are you trying to replicate
the<00:06:08.830> design<00:06:09.190> specifically<00:06:09.850> or<00:06:10.030> where<00:06:10.150> you're

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
the design specifically or where you're

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.240 
the design specifically or where you're
just<00:06:10.450> trying<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.690> replicate<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.260> tone<00:06:11.500> did

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
just trying to replicate the tone did

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.680 
just trying to replicate the tone did
you<00:06:12.370> just<00:06:12.520> use<00:06:12.700> the<00:06:12.880> design<00:06:13.150> as<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.330> starting

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
you just use the design as a starting

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.630 
you just use the design as a starting
point<00:06:14.790> well<00:06:15.790> I<00:06:15.930> found<00:06:16.930> it<00:06:17.320> by<00:06:17.650> digging<00:06:18.160> into

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
point well I found it by digging into

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.780 
point well I found it by digging into
the<00:06:19.000> design<00:06:19.470> which<00:06:20.470> means<00:06:20.670> things<00:06:21.670> like

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
the design which means things like

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.700 
the design which means things like
thicknesses<00:06:22.540> it<00:06:22.720> doesn't<00:06:23.140> mean<00:06:23.350> just

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
thicknesses it doesn't mean just

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.490 
thicknesses it doesn't mean just
appearances<00:06:24.550> I<00:06:24.790> tried<00:06:25.510> to<00:06:25.660> replicate<00:06:25.930> the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
appearances I tried to replicate the

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.480 
appearances I tried to replicate the
appearance<00:06:27.150> but<00:06:28.150> also<00:06:28.830> tried<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:30.010> find<00:06:30.280> out

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
appearance but also tried to find out

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.960 
appearance but also tried to find out
what<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:31.120> unique<00:06:31.750> things<00:06:32.230> that<00:06:32.710> were<00:06:32.979> inside

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
what the unique things that were inside

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.020 
what the unique things that were inside
or<00:06:34.570> in<00:06:34.600> the<00:06:34.960> construction<00:06:35.470> now<00:06:36.220> you<00:06:36.729> know<00:06:36.820> do

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
or in the construction now you know do

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.610 
or in the construction now you know do
it

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
it

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.680 
it
I<00:06:38.650> was<00:06:38.979> goofy<00:06:39.370> or<00:06:40.030> if<00:06:40.120> it<00:06:40.210> didn't<00:06:40.510> make<00:06:40.660> sense

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
I was goofy or if it didn't make sense

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.230 
I was goofy or if it didn't make sense
to<00:06:41.199> me<00:06:41.229> I'd<00:06:41.740> go<00:06:42.010> ahead<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:42.460> follow<00:06:42.699> the<00:06:43.000> path

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
to me I'd go ahead and follow the path

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.080 
to me I'd go ahead and follow the path
anyway<00:06:43.780> and<00:06:44.020> I<00:06:44.860> found<00:06:45.130> that<00:06:45.370> by<00:06:45.550> doing<00:06:45.610> that

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
anyway and I found that by doing that

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.540 
anyway and I found that by doing that
that's<00:06:46.540> when<00:06:46.840> you<00:06:46.870> start<00:06:47.169> to<00:06:47.260> get<00:06:47.410> these<00:06:47.740> you

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
that's when you start to get these you

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.879 
that's when you start to get these you
know<00:06:48.669> he'll<00:06:48.970> copies<00:06:49.630> and<00:06:49.960> the<00:06:50.020> master<00:06:50.590> series

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
know he'll copies and the master series

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.730 
know he'll copies and the master series
start<00:06:51.520> to<00:06:51.669> sound<00:06:52.060> like<00:06:52.449> they're<00:06:53.410> from<00:06:53.440> the

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
start to sound like they're from the

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.560 
start to sound like they're from the
same<00:06:53.919> family<00:06:54.460> anyway<00:06:54.760> as<00:06:54.910> their<00:06:55.090> original

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
same family anyway as their original

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.870 
same family anyway as their original
start<00:06:55.870> to<00:06:56.020> acquire<00:06:56.500> the<00:06:56.860> characteristics<00:06:57.699> of

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
start to acquire the characteristics of

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.689 
start to acquire the characteristics of
the<00:06:58.000> originals<00:06:58.860> otherwise<00:06:59.860> that<00:07:00.310> just<00:07:00.550> all

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
the originals otherwise that just all

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.290 
the originals otherwise that just all
sound<00:07:00.940> like<00:07:01.030> Hills<00:07:01.419> but<00:07:01.919> when<00:07:02.919> you<00:07:03.040> go<00:07:03.300> really

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
sound like Hills but when you go really

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.540 
sound like Hills but when you go really
into<00:07:04.540> the<00:07:04.660> details<00:07:05.139> and<00:07:05.440> you<00:07:05.979> repeat<00:07:06.370> it<00:07:06.400> you

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
into the details and you repeat it you

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.010 
into the details and you repeat it you
don't<00:07:06.850> get<00:07:07.000> it<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.240> first<00:07:07.419> time<00:07:07.570> it<00:07:07.900> takes

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
don't get it the first time it takes

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.800 
don't get it the first time it takes
many<00:07:08.380> repetitions<00:07:08.710> of<00:07:09.400> it<00:07:09.550> design<00:07:09.880> to<00:07:10.510> start

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
many repetitions of it design to start

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.000 
many repetitions of it design to start
to<00:07:10.960> kind<00:07:11.139> of<00:07:12.360> get<00:07:13.360> into<00:07:13.570> the<00:07:13.930> get<00:07:14.590> into<00:07:14.889> the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
to kind of get into the get into the

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.270 
to kind of get into the get into the
form<00:07:15.340> and<00:07:16.050> so<00:07:17.050> you<00:07:17.440> know<00:07:17.560> I<00:07:17.590> learned<00:07:17.919> a<00:07:18.100> lot

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
form and so you know I learned a lot

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.000 
form and so you know I learned a lot
from<00:07:18.340> doing<00:07:18.850> that<00:07:19.470> I'm<00:07:20.470> a<00:07:20.590> lot<00:07:20.800> less

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
from doing that I'm a lot less

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.800 
from doing that I'm a lot less
interested<00:07:21.580> in<00:07:21.669> doing<00:07:21.910> that<00:07:22.030> now<00:07:22.300> because

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
interested in doing that now because

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.960 
interested in doing that now because
I've<00:07:22.960> done<00:07:23.289> it<00:07:23.530> a<00:07:23.680> lot<00:07:24.539> so<00:07:25.539> it's<00:07:25.750> not<00:07:25.990> and<00:07:26.260> I'm

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
I've done it a lot so it's not and I'm

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.550 
I've done it a lot so it's not and I'm
losing<00:07:27.970> interest<00:07:28.330> in<00:07:28.600> replicating<00:07:29.289> other

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
losing interest in replicating other

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.250 
losing interest in replicating other
people's<00:07:29.979> work<00:07:30.220> now<00:07:30.690> now<00:07:31.690> the<00:07:31.750> only<00:07:32.050> one<00:07:32.229> I

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
people's work now now the only one I

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:42.849 
but otherwise I kind of often my own

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:46.110 
but otherwise I kind of often my own
ideas<00:07:43.389> and<00:07:43.680> this<00:07:44.680> is<00:07:44.950> now<00:07:45.310> much<00:07:45.940> more

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120
