we've got a set of two resettable count

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.440 
we've got a set of two resettable count
up<00:04:06.780> timers<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.310> tap<00:04:08.520> them<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.850> start<00:04:09.120> tap

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
both of them together at once so that's

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.240 
both of them together at once so that's
really<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.690> functionality<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:23.010> out

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
really the functionality that is out

really the functionality that is out
there<00:04:23.280> right<00:04:23.640> now<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:24.150> only<00:04:24.750> expect<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.500> to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
there right now I only expect that to

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.010 
there right now I only expect that to
improve<00:04:26.420> but<00:04:27.420> for<00:04:27.750> June<00:04:27.990> 2015<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.740> month<00:04:29.070> after
