00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
your back muscles and that's it's gonna

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.420 
your back muscles and that's it's gonna
keep<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.930> strong<00:03:59.290> so<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.680> you<00:03:59.799> hold<00:04:00.190> the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
keep you strong so that you hold the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.550 
keep you strong so that you hold the
belly<00:04:00.700> yeah<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.720> if<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.900> have<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.079> stronger

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
belly yeah and if you have a stronger

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.780 
belly yeah and if you have a stronger
back<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.859> don't<00:04:03.010> need<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.190> be<00:04:03.310> walking<00:04:03.519> like

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
back you don't need to be walking like

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.180 
back you don't need to be walking like
it<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:05.220> lot<00:04:06.220> of<00:04:06.340> us<00:04:06.430> do<00:04:06.549> that<00:04:06.700> pregnancy<00:04:07.239> loss<00:04:08.190> so

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
it a lot of us do that pregnancy loss so

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.699 
it a lot of us do that pregnancy loss so
15<00:04:09.760> or<00:04:10.150> one<00:04:10.359> two<00:04:10.600> or<00:04:10.750> three<00:04:10.989> sets<00:04:11.170> okay<00:04:11.380> all

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
15 or one two or three sets okay all

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.920 
15 or one two or three sets okay all
right<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:11.889> then<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> last<00:04:12.549> one<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.209> we<00:04:13.630> have

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
right and then the last one is we have

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.830 
right and then the last one is we have
to<00:04:14.200> work<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.620> our<00:04:14.709> core<00:04:15.069> muscles<00:04:15.419> however<00:04:16.419> we

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
to work on our core muscles however we

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.379 
to work on our core muscles however we
cannot<00:04:17.200> do<00:04:17.560> crunches<00:04:18.250> guys<00:04:18.820> we<00:04:18.940> can't<00:04:19.180> lie

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
cannot do crunches guys we can't lie

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.360 
cannot do crunches guys we can't lie
down<00:04:19.690> when<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:19.959> have<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.139> big<00:04:20.380> belly<00:04:20.530> right<00:04:20.950> so

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
down when you have a big belly right so

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.770 
down when you have a big belly right so
what<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:21.760> do<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.300> we're<00:04:22.510> going<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.660> do

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
what you do is that we're going to do

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.510 
what you do is that we're going to do
some<00:04:23.020> balancing<00:04:23.620> moves<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:24.070> are<00:04:24.160> going<00:04:24.340> to

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
some balancing moves that are going to

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.450 
some balancing moves that are going to
activate<00:04:25.270> your<00:04:25.450> core<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.410> feet<00:04:26.620> together<00:04:26.830> okay

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
activate your core so feet together okay

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.670 
activate your core so feet together okay
I<00:04:27.580> need<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.820> do<00:04:28.030> these<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.330> would<00:04:28.419> say<00:04:28.840> holding

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
I need to do these I would say holding

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.460 
I need to do these I would say holding
onto<00:04:29.860> something<00:04:30.220> okay<00:04:30.789> like<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.030> chair<00:04:31.419> or<00:04:31.840> if

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
onto something okay like a chair or if

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.990 
onto something okay like a chair or if
you're<00:04:32.680> used<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:33.070> doing<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.460> then<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.639> can<00:04:33.880> do

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you're used to doing it then you can do

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.510 
you're used to doing it then you can do
it<00:04:34.030> like<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.840> one<00:04:35.770> leg<00:04:35.979> up<00:04:36.099> and<00:04:36.250> then<00:04:36.340> the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
it like that one leg up and then the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.710 
it like that one leg up and then the
other<00:04:36.550> one<00:04:36.789> down<00:04:36.909> you<00:04:37.060> can<00:04:37.180> extend<00:04:37.539> the<00:04:37.690> arms

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
other one down you can extend the arms

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.269 
other one down you can extend the arms
to<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.110> side

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:39.279 
to the side

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.769 
to the side
and<00:04:39.369> then<00:04:39.579> for<00:04:39.849> you<00:04:40.059> it<00:04:40.329> might<00:04:40.419> be<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.629> little

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:40.779 
and then for you it might be a little

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.929 
and then for you it might be a little
easier<00:04:41.139> but<00:04:41.709> for<00:04:41.739> me<00:04:42.129> it's<00:04:42.279> hard<00:04:42.459> because<00:04:42.669> my

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:42.939 
easier but for me it's hard because my

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.149 
easier but for me it's hard because my
center<00:04:43.389> of<00:04:43.419> gravity's<00:04:44.199> off<00:04:44.409> and<00:04:44.799> so<00:04:44.979> you've

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
center of gravity's off and so you've

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.529 
center of gravity's off and so you've
really<00:04:45.399> got<00:04:45.519> to<00:04:45.729> work<00:04:45.819> to<00:04:45.969> keep<00:04:46.089> that<00:04:46.299> balance

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
really got to work to keep that balance

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.599 
really got to work to keep that balance
you<00:04:47.349> probably<00:04:47.829> hold<00:04:48.069> on<00:04:48.219> to<00:04:48.399> something

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:48.609 
you probably hold on to something

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:50.969 
you probably hold on to something
absolutely<00:04:49.449> and<00:04:49.929> then<00:04:50.049> that's<00:04:50.349> going<00:04:50.589> to<00:04:50.769> help

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
absolutely and then that's going to help

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.669 
absolutely and then that's going to help
you<00:04:51.189> activate<00:04:51.519> the<00:04:52.359> core<00:04:52.599> muscles<00:04:52.869> engaging

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:53.679 
you activate the core muscles engaging

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:55.889 
you activate the core muscles engaging
the<00:04:53.949> abdominals<00:04:54.389> without<00:04:55.389> doing<00:04:55.749> the

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:55.899 
the abdominals without doing the

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.199 
the abdominals without doing the
crunches<00:04:56.289> but<00:04:57.279> what<00:04:57.459> that<00:04:57.609> does<00:04:57.819> is<00:04:57.969> that<00:04:57.999> it

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:58.209 
crunches but what that does is that it

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.089 
crunches but what that does is that it
helps<00:04:58.239> your<00:04:58.719> core<00:04:59.019> and<00:04:59.589> when<00:04:59.709> you<00:04:59.799> have<00:04:59.979> the

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
helps your core and when you have the

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.639 
helps your core and when you have the
baby<00:05:00.309> that<00:05:00.489> you<00:05:00.699> can<00:05:00.879> have<00:05:01.059> a<00:05:01.089> tighter<00:05:01.649> stomach

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:02.649 
baby that you can have a tighter stomach

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.879 
baby that you can have a tighter stomach
back<00:05:03.089> that<00:05:04.089> is<00:05:04.389> such<00:05:04.779> a<00:05:04.809> great<00:05:05.259> point<00:05:05.619> because

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
back that is such a great point because

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.919 
back that is such a great point because
a<00:05:06.099> lot<00:05:06.369> of<00:05:06.519> it<00:05:06.639> I<00:05:06.699> have<00:05:06.849> three<00:05:07.179> kids<00:05:07.449> and<00:05:07.809> after
