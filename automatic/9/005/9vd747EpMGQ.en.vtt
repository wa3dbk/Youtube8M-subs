all this paper SLV and gld to keep our
physical<00:05:02.940> prices<00:05:03.330> reasonable<00:05:04.580> so<00:05:05.580> we<00:05:05.730> could

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
physical prices reasonable so we could

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.610 
physical prices reasonable so we could
buy<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.120> up<00:05:06.330> at<00:05:06.450> discounted<00:05:06.870> prices<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.470> when

we can no longer have that game
continued<00:05:10.400> prices<00:05:11.400> will<00:05:11.550> go<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.910> moon<00:05:12.150> now

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
continued prices will go to the moon now

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.570
