00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
so there's a 110 volt charger that comes

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.560 
so there's a 110 volt charger that comes
with<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.420> car<00:03:27.610> takes<00:03:28.610> about<00:03:28.760> ten<00:03:29.120> hours<00:03:29.150> to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
with the car takes about ten hours to

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.260 
with the car takes about ten hours to
charge<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.020> battery<00:03:30.440> there's<00:03:31.430> an<00:03:31.730> optional

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
charge the battery there's an optional

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.650
