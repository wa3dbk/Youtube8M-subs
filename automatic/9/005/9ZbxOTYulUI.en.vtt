either<00:00:18.460> because<00:00:19.000> that<00:00:19.270> basically<00:00:19.720> is<00:00:19.870> just

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
either because that basically is just

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.500 
either because that basically is just
enabling<00:00:20.590> central<00:00:21.580> bank<00:00:21.760> currency<00:00:22.300> to

the economic and political problems that

the economic and political problems that

experiences after the Second World War

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.120 
experiences after the Second World War
because<00:03:58.959> they<00:03:59.170> were<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.410> too<00:03:59.620> young<00:03:59.799> to<00:04:00.040> have

because they were just too young to have

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.069 
because they were just too young to have
lived<00:04:00.340> through<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.120> as<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.510> consequence

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
lived through it and as a consequence

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.390 
lived through it and as a consequence
you<00:04:02.290> started<00:04:02.650> seeing<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:02.980> little<00:04:03.130> bit<00:04:03.250> of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
you started seeing a little bit of

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.120 
you started seeing a little bit of
moving<00:04:03.670> away<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.269> now<00:04:04.630> with<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.870> ECB<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.859> think

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
moving away and now with the ECB I think

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.949 
moving away and now with the ECB I think
it's<00:04:06.250> quite<00:04:06.370> clear<00:04:06.609> that<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.970> ECB<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.570> not<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
it's quite clear that the ECB is not the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.229 
it's quite clear that the ECB is not the
Bundesbank<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.739> don't<00:04:09.370> see<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.030> role<00:04:10.209> of

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
Bundesbank and don't see the role of

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.910 
Bundesbank and don't see the role of
stable<00:04:10.690> money<00:04:10.900> quite<00:04:11.140> as<00:04:11.260> clearly<00:04:11.560> as<00:04:11.769> the

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
stable money quite as clearly as the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.860 
stable money quite as clearly as the
Bundesbank<00:04:12.430> did<00:04:12.609> particularly<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.480> 60s

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
Bundesbank did particularly in the 60s

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.109 
Bundesbank did particularly in the 60s
and<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.079> 70s
