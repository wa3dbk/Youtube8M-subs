00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.380 
in the early Seussical dukes they use
the<00:01:55.140> narrower<00:01:55.470> brush<00:01:55.830> guard<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.910> so<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.210> have

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the narrower brush guard and so we have

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.300 
the narrower brush guard and so we have
the<00:01:57.540> exact<00:01:57.960> replica<00:01:58.290> dimensions<00:01:59.010> for<00:01:59.160> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the exact replica dimensions for that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.560 
the exact replica dimensions for that
and<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.580> built<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> brush<00:02:00.060> guard<00:02:00.300> for<00:02:00.450> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and we built the brush guard for this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.390 
and we built the brush guard for this
car<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.380> put<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.650> same<00:02:01.800> brush<00:02:02.070> guard<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
car so we put the same brush guard it

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.380 
car so we put the same brush guard it
would<00:02:02.550> have<00:02:02.640> had<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.060> 1980<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.850> Confederate

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
would have had in 1980 the Confederate

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.150 
would have had in 1980 the Confederate

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
flag painted on the roof and the zero

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160 
flag painted on the roof and the zero
ones<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> door<00:02:11.910> are<00:02:12.180> painted<00:02:12.570> on<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:13.110> the
