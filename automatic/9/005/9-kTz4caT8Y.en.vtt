what heck would you want to clean your

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.439 
what heck would you want to clean your
brain<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:15.150> toxins<00:00:16.020> build<00:00:16.410> up<00:00:17.150> toxins<00:00:18.150> and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
brain because toxins build up toxins and

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.529 
brain because toxins build up toxins and
plaque<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:19.289> cause<00:00:19.529> dementia<00:00:20.539> now

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
plaque that can cause dementia now

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.029 
plaque that can cause dementia now
according<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:23.269> recent<00:00:24.269> study<00:00:24.539> by<00:00:24.750> the

University of Rochester Medical Center
they<00:00:28.710> discovered<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.210> brain<00:00:30.390> cleans

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
they discovered that the brain cleans

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.600 
they discovered that the brain cleans
itself<00:00:31.590> guess<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.149> sleeping

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
itself guess when when you're sleeping

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.819 
itself guess when when you're sleeping
the<00:00:35.610> brain<00:00:35.880> needs<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.510> much<00:00:36.750> activity<00:00:37.050> during

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the brain needs so much activity during

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.130 
the brain needs so much activity during
the<00:00:38.010> day<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> good<00:00:39.329> time<00:00:39.390> when

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the day it's just not a good time when

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.100 
the day it's just not a good time when
it's<00:00:40.320> doing<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.860> kinds<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:42.110> problem-solving

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's doing all kinds of problem-solving

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.020 
it's doing all kinds of problem-solving
etc<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.670> here's<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.360> happens<00:00:45.840> every<00:00:46.020> night

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
etc so here's what happens every night

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.619 
etc so here's what happens every night
spinal<00:00:48.030> column<00:00:48.450> fluid<00:00:49.550> comes<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> bathes

spinal column fluid comes up and bathes

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
spinal column fluid comes up and bathes
your<00:00:52.199> brain<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.039> cleans<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.770> order<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
your brain and cleans it so in order to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.229 
your brain and cleans it so in order to
get<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> best<00:00:57.449> sleep<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.710> recharging<00:00:59.550> of

get the best sleep and recharging of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.650 
get the best sleep and recharging of
your<00:01:00.719> brain<00:01:01.370> why<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.640> help<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.300> spinal

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
your brain why not help your spinal

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.039 
your brain why not help your spinal
column<00:01:03.989> fluid<00:01:04.909> years<00:01:05.909> ago<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:06.810> given

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
column fluid years ago I was given

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.100 
column fluid years ago I was given
guidance<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.790> spinal<00:01:09.090> column<00:01:09.390> fluid<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
guidance that the spinal column fluid is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
guidance that the spinal column fluid is
so<00:01:10.350> much<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.799> important<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.970> even

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so much more important that we can even

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.980 
so much more important that we can even
imagine<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:14.390> has<00:01:15.390> its<00:01:15.750> own

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
imagine it's actually has its own

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
imagine it's actually has its own
consciousness<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.369> lot<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.869> exercises<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
consciousness and a lot of exercises I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.859 
consciousness and a lot of exercises I
do<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.740> people<00:01:20.159> bring<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.030> power<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
do I have people bring the power of the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.340 
do I have people bring the power of the
elements<00:01:22.759> into<00:01:23.759> their<00:01:23.939> spinal<00:01:24.330> column<00:01:24.840> fluid

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
elements into their spinal column fluid

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.270 
elements into their spinal column fluid
and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.799> purposely<00:01:26.400> bathe<00:01:27.000> their<00:01:27.360> brain<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
and then purposely bathe their brain I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.789 
and then purposely bathe their brain I

however for general cleaning of the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
however for general cleaning of the
brain<00:01:39.600> since<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.530> spinal<00:01:40.950> column<00:01:41.130> fluid<00:01:41.790> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
brain since the spinal column fluid is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.440 
brain since the spinal column fluid is
going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.990> every<00:01:43.350> night<00:01:43.530> anyway<00:01:44.450> why

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
going to do it every night anyway why

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.789 
going to do it every night anyway why
not<00:01:45.479> give<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> some<00:01:46.590> extra<00:01:46.829> power<00:01:48.049> by<00:01:49.049> chanting

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
not give it some extra power by chanting

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.340 
not give it some extra power by chanting
a<00:01:50.040> sound<00:01:51.530> into<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.890> spinal<00:01:53.220> column<00:01:53.549> fluid

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
a sound into the spinal column fluid

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.179 
a sound into the spinal column fluid
sounds<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.829> much<00:01:56.040> power<00:01:56.750> now<00:01:58.130> how<00:01:59.130> are

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
sounds have so much power now how are

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
sounds have so much power now how are
you<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.270> use<00:02:00.570> your

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you going to do that well use your

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.109 
you going to do that well use your
imagination<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> most<00:02:02.159> awesome<00:02:02.399> tool

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
imagination it's the most awesome tool

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
imagination it's the most awesome tool
and<00:02:03.799> energy<00:02:04.799> follows<00:02:05.509> awareness<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:07.500> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and energy follows awareness when you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.249 
and energy follows awareness when you
command<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.670> energy<00:02:09.179> field<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> thing

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
command your energy field to do a thing

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.210 
command your energy field to do a thing
it<00:02:10.530> does<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.690> vote

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
it does it and so you can vote

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.380 
it does it and so you can vote
on<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.760> bottom<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.270> your<00:02:14.450> spine<00:02:14.600> and

on the bottom of your spine and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.440 
on the bottom of your spine and
recognize<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.260> consciousness<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.520> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
recognize it is a consciousness and I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.960 
recognize it is a consciousness and I
would<00:02:20.750> chance<00:02:21.140> something<00:02:21.860> simple<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.520> you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
would chance something simple that you
