00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
obviously the ice has been kind of slow
making<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> ice<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.979> we're<00:02:11.310> finally<00:02:11.520> just

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
making the ice so we're finally just

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
making the ice so we're finally just
starting<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:12.180> out<00:02:12.300> and
