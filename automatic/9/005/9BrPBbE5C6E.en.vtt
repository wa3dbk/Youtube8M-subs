00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.169 

we're<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.129> examine<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.639> trouble<00:00:03.030> and

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
we're going to examine the trouble and

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.970 
we're going to examine the trouble and
the<00:00:03.300> governor<00:00:03.600> arrangement<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.470> life<00:00:04.799> of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
the governor arrangement on the life of

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:15.950 
the governor arrangement on the life of
five<00:00:05.790> horsepower<00:00:06.180> engine<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> if<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.809> look

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
five horsepower engine so if we look

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.570 
five horsepower engine so if we look
down<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.800> see<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:18.000> governor<00:00:18.359> arm

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
down here we can see the governor arm

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.179 
down here we can see the governor arm
and<00:00:20.580> that's<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> way<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> moves<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.570> operation

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
and that's the way it moves in operation

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.660 
and that's the way it moves in operation
and<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> governor<00:00:25.289> arm<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.769> adjusted<00:00:26.250> by<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and the governor arm is adjusted by a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.900 
and the governor arm is adjusted by a
screw<00:00:27.529> which<00:00:28.529> controls<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.310> strength<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
screw which controls the strength of a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.010 
screw which controls the strength of a
spring<00:00:31.189> which<00:00:32.189> decides<00:00:32.850> how<00:00:33.570> much<00:00:33.750> influence

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
spring which decides how much influence

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.250 
spring which decides how much influence
the<00:00:34.380> governor<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.640> speed<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.260> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the governor has on the speed of the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.810 
the governor has on the speed of the
engine<00:00:38.719> as<00:00:39.719> well<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.440> also<00:00:40.620> see

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
engine as well as that we can also see

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.440 
engine as well as that we can also see
the<00:00:41.820> traffic<00:00:42.090> are<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> choke<00:00:43.230> operation<00:00:43.890> here

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
the traffic are the choke operation here

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.880 
the traffic are the choke operation here
back<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.570> forward<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.930> choke<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
back and forward that's choke on and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.060 
back and forward that's choke on and
choke<00:00:47.160> off<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> we're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> go<00:00:49.770> around<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
choke off so we're going to go around to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
choke off so we're going to go around to
the<00:00:50.219> carburetor<00:00:50.489> side<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> look

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the carburetor side now and have a look

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
the carburetor side now and have a look
at<00:00:52.289> those<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> operation<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> first<00:00:53.460> one

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
at those in operation so the first one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.680 
at those in operation so the first one
is<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> choke<00:00:54.030> flap<00:00:56.149> today<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
is to choke flap today we can see the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.770 
is to choke flap today we can see the
choke<00:00:57.899> flap<00:00:58.170> operating<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> next<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
choke flap operating and the next one is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.620 
choke flap operating and the next one is
the<00:01:00.899> Trotter<00:01:01.140> fun<00:01:05.960> operation

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.880 

so<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> start<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
so now we're going to start up the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
so now we're going to start up the
engine<00:01:11.100> we're<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> run<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.240> speed

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
engine we're going to run it at speed

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
engine we're going to run it at speed
and<00:01:14.600> we're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> observe<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.590> shuttle

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and we're going to observe the shuttle

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:51.020 
and we're going to observe the shuttle
walk

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.250 

so<00:01:52.030> here<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.480> an<00:01:52.570> engine<00:01:52.900> stripped<00:01:53.200> down

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
so here we have an engine stripped down

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.830 
so here we have an engine stripped down
and<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.290> see<00:02:00.030> there's<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.270> operation<00:02:01.780> of

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
and we can see there's the operation of

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.910 
and we can see there's the operation of
the<00:02:01.990> level<00:02:02.320> we've<00:02:02.440> just<00:02:02.620> been<00:02:02.800> observing<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
the level we've just been observing and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.920 
the level we've just been observing and
if<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.160> look<00:02:06.340> inside<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.850> engine<00:02:08.040> we<00:02:09.040> can<00:02:09.070> see

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
if we look inside the engine we can see

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.470 
if we look inside the engine we can see
there's<00:02:10.930> a<00:02:10.990> paddle<00:02:11.380> there<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.270> when<00:02:13.390> that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there's a paddle there and when that

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.350 
there's a paddle there and when that
paddles<00:02:13.870> uh<00:02:13.960> parades<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.610> leave<00:02:15.820> our<00:02:16.030> outside

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
paddles uh parades to leave our outside

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.780 
paddles uh parades to leave our outside
operates<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.860> controls<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> throttle

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
operates and controls the throttle

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.540 
operates and controls the throttle
position<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.120> paddle<00:02:22.510> there<00:02:22.690> is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
position so that paddle there is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.180 
position so that paddle there is
operated<00:02:24.550> by<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.900> centrifugal<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.710> voice<00:02:26.890> in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
operated by the centrifugal the voice in

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.710 
operated by the centrifugal the voice in
other<00:02:27.340> words<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.820> voice<00:02:28.000> that's<00:02:28.330> sensitive

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
other words the voice that's sensitive

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.850 
other words the voice that's sensitive
to<00:02:28.870> speed<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:31.540> look<00:02:31.750> at<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.930> now<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.440> here

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
to speed so we look at that now and here

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.440 
to speed so we look at that now and here
we<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.070> see<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> camshaft<00:02:35.550> which<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:37.120> being

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
we can see the camshaft which is being

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.180 
we can see the camshaft which is being
driven<00:02:37.630> off<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:38.200> helical<00:02:38.680> gear<00:02:38.890> from<00:02:39.070> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
driven off a helical gear from the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.290 
driven off a helical gear from the
crankshaft<00:02:39.660> which<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.810> torn<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> bevel<00:02:42.040> gear

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
crankshaft which in torn to a bevel gear

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.940 
crankshaft which in torn to a bevel gear
drives<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.510> assembly<00:02:44.020> here<00:02:44.050> we<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:44.800> see

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
drives this assembly here we can see

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.560 
drives this assembly here we can see
there's<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.250> plunger<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:46.510> comes<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.110> out

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
there's a plunger that comes in and out

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.060 
there's a plunger that comes in and out
and<00:02:49.570> as<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.780> plunger<00:02:50.230> comes<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.740> there<00:02:50.860> we

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
and as the plunger comes in and there we

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.410 
and as the plunger comes in and there we
noticed<00:02:51.460> that<00:02:51.550> there<00:02:51.970> are<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.090> couple<00:02:52.240> of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
noticed that there are a couple of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.170 
noticed that there are a couple of
weights<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.990> are<00:02:53.050> splaying<00:02:53.410> out<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.970> those

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
weights that are splaying out so those

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.560 
weights that are splaying out so those
weights<00:02:56.130> splay<00:02:57.130> out<00:02:57.160> under<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.970> influence<00:02:58.360> of

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
weights splay out under the influence of

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.810 
weights splay out under the influence of
centrifugal<00:02:59.170> force<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.310> faster<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
centrifugal force so the faster the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.460 
centrifugal force so the faster the
engine<00:03:00.910> goes<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.600> more<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> weight<00:03:02.080> splay

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
engine goes the more the weight splay

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.310 
engine goes the more the weight splay
out<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.610> more<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.910> plunger<00:03:04.300> pushes<00:03:05.140> out

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
out and the more the plunger pushes out

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.000 
out and the more the plunger pushes out
when<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.220> plunger<00:03:06.580> pushes<00:03:06.940> out<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:08.200> acts<00:03:08.620> on
