00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.370
 bad connection quality support 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:13.309
 bad software 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.309
 that concludes hahahahaha 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.310
 Last news known asked you if yours 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 smartphone for the one plus one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.010
 they would destroy some of that 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.840
 for example, mac has written so 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.519
 my s4 would have deserved it 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 to be poked the little one 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.399
 Drecksau youtube 123 wrote me 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 my motorola defy mini would even be of 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 in a nutshell, throw up a bridge 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.559
 every case and take up type has 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 I have written the next 5 and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.010
 I think I would not 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 I would rather ruin an old one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 take mobile phone and say that would be mine 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.739
 current there was some controversy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.780
 opinions on this subject, however 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.610
 Already there are people already 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 have destroyed your smartphone and that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.180
 spotted whole on video 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 with the slogan smash of the lot and you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 on youtube already thousands of videos and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.530
 you people with diverse 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.350
 objects such as a hammer or 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.210
 maybe a lighter for the first time 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.710
 of ruined hooks in this matter 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.380
 following that you can not automatically 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.479
 video on youtube with a destroyed one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 smartphone uploads that one automatically 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.259
 Participates but only on the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.450
 official website of montas 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 must register at which bursts 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 also want to get for a dollar 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.700
 100 participants are then drawn and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.250
 it then you should be on your smartphone 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.470
 a 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.960
 erhard does not destroy it then 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.850
 is more reconstructable is eg ignite 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.700
 but I do not praise it all 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.470
 Many criticisms that just as one 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.090
 meaningless destruction is and that one 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.410
 give the smartphone places as well 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.810
 could and make him very happy 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.070
 could do with what those 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.020
 of course, have a bit of law 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.760
 if the action wants to participate 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.869
 first get in touch with the official 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.460
 website 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.850
 and only then can you get your smartphone 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.979
 to start what has room in the name 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 exactly google + do the project manager of 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.880
 google + vic gundotra has the company 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.649
 leave and google + for now without 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.090
 Guidance at google knows you 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.040
 but not as good as that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.650
 whole project should continue 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.989
 The platform is supposed to be planned 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.640
 on pieced is so for example in 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.770
 the successful hangout that the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.870
 to be outsourced or that the pictures 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.090
 It is not outsourced that function 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.950
 more google + from product but has 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.810
 google + is her name rather than space 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.330
 also an important element for google there 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.880
 because the service is now with 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.580
 many other services linked and 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.650
 closely connected and other too youtube 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.630
 in the commentary for what it was then 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.370
 some criticism hailed it is on 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.320
 every case in the future some changes 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 at google + give that shows already 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.220
 the fact that many employees are the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.080
 current only responsible for google + 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.610
 were deducted from this area 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.900
 other areas are resettled 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.640
 Be like for example in android 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.920
 any one of you is using 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.230
 actually google + and someone already has 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.840
 actually posted there or 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.940
 posted a picture or is active there 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.090
 I have it in the comments 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.519
 namely in the google + comments 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.290
 hey what would a music and an Amazon 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.060
 news and amazon has this week again 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.209
 a lot to announce the packages gets 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.030
 yes, a usa either by us post 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.890
 or by fax or by gps is 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.569
 amazon but in the future change e mobile 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.190
 Build your own delivery services 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.330
 the reason that the shipping costs the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.709
 really very last years 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.510
 have risen and it's easy 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.610
 it's more economical for Amazon if you can 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.200
 simply what own reason is before 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.910
 all the dear delays in the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.040
 christmas shop there were some 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.080
 angry customers of ubs fedex or 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.120
 the us post just too late your packages 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.010
 have received a first test phase 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.870
 there are already the usa and even in 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.000
 Great Britain many customers complain 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.950
 but that of Amazon's delivery services 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.870
 not really reliable and it is there 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.780
 already some delays from one 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.440
 there are still a few days left 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.569
 expandable but you will be in the future 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.540
 see if once sun creates the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.959
 Experiences from the current forwarding agencies 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.090
 service providers to catch up 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.349
 and your own delivery service on and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.180
 maybe we'll get the pizza soon 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:12.160
 also delivered cool by Amazon express 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.019
 but as well as a pizza from Amazon 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.340
 let it deliver writes that in 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.260
 the comments 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.660
 below me there's two more 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.910
 videos also necessarily once 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.440
 once the last news beck games cable 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.970
 the last news beck technology issue 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.440
 newsweek technology issue I have too 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.630
 So when do you say that wolf bursts? 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.310
 He happens to click on it 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.310
 there and bye
