00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:24.030 

Oh

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:36.680 

nope<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.459> bird<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.969> not<00:02:26.000> going<00:02:26.689> for<00:02:26.900> Eli

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.710 

it's<00:02:37.690> very<00:02:37.990> curious<00:02:38.350> though<00:02:39.120> I'm<00:02:40.120> telling<00:02:40.600> you

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
it's very curious though I'm telling you

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.620 
it's very curious though I'm telling you
it<00:02:40.840> keeps<00:02:41.080> flying<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:42.790> keeps<00:02:43.030> flying<00:02:43.330> to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
it keeps flying like it keeps flying to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.070 
it keeps flying like it keeps flying to
different<00:02:43.750> legends<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.590> he<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.070> you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.430 

okay<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.150> theory<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:51.260> you're

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
okay so so the theory is that if you're

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.350 
okay so so the theory is that if you're
Elijah<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.190> won't<00:02:52.430> get<00:02:52.610> attacked<00:02:52.940> because<00:02:53.210> he

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
Elijah you won't get attacked because he

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.630 
Elijah you won't get attacked because he
doesn't<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:54.050> your<00:02:54.230> ball<00:02:54.440> head<00:02:54.680> or<00:02:54.890> your<00:02:55.430> bird

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
doesn't like your ball head or your bird

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.170 
doesn't like your ball head or your bird
hat

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180 

okay
