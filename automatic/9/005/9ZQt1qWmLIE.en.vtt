00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.060
 see only then arrived at the very end I 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.800
 I already have my tongue folded 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.250
 You see that little double look where 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.289
 Is the needle seen now for you? 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.239
 take off this point still acts needle that 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.939
 will make the following O in the same hole 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.340
 where you will have made a low will be 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.399
 the last one on the low that will be made 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.489
 pass the needle again and you will 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.219
 cast off with the lowest point then 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.750
 you that your needle such toquinho same 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.150
 of your job 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.649
 Pull the thread there, cut a piece right 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.730
 and then you give your good old little pig 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.840
 fine 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.180
 It's just a rita thing to see if 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.840
 You did not get this way, it's not wrong. 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.659
 because here you have worked the language 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.280
 in two points, see 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.799
 first the second you're here 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.850
 exactly where your cane ends 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.439
 and where you already have a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.600
 white tongue 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.119
 It's good to keep an eye out to see if you can not. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.319
 came to stop in the wrong place or if you 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.630
 not jumped exactly in the union of 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.409
 they all just that I learned 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.289
 okay okay so now it's time for us 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.490
 work to end even in the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.119
 execution 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.149
 We are going to work the shoelace now. 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.659
 people will vary depending on the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.270
 Chicano size is the size of the 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.479
 Your tongue will have a bigger cord. 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.490
 or smaller what we are going to do nothing else 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.849
 is a simple string of 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.079
 little chains look're just seeing so here 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.899
 You'll have to work a 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.950
 number of little chains to give to 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.709
 You braid through the little holes. 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.099
 What did you do and pass to give a 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:18.380
 cart is okay so it will vary me here 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.050
 I made a string with 180 strings then 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.200
 you will have to see if you have followed the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.620
 my measurements 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 a zircon with 180 will give if you 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.239
 made you cry less - chains if you 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.750
 did most will be more little chains're good 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.180
 again with the little black thread line 4 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.360
 let's give it here our first 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.580
 I just started working and I 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.640
 I suggest that you leave tamanhinho 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.099
 relatively large're left because 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.620
 You have to think about climbing with him. 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.780
 so I did the first one he is 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.140
 The first chain is on the needle. 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.049
 will hold the two children together just 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.569
 Seeing here maybe together it's not all going 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.569
 hold the two neighbors together as if 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.650
 were you going to work normally will 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.489
 pull the two neighbors together geek 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.709
 See how they show together and it will bring 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.349
 inside your chain and will 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.140
 Fit looks like what I did mine 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.880
 I adjusted then I have a chain 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.519
 inside the other 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.040
 from now on you have to hold 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.500
 down here as if you had really 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.579
 A little thread for you to hold, why not? 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.810
 had she 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.480
 I tugged between my fingers 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.310
 was accepted between the little fingers and there you 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.930
 continues to work two chains 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.069
 you had a good your first we're there 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.889
 on whim and you do not lose the beginning anymore 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.350
 wine because because it 's a cordão tá gente 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:59.430
 You do not have to perfect the ship okay 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.380
 O then I'm going to do here 180 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.470
 good lines 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.660
 now you will do as I already said 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.200
 the size that is required for 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.019
 you can get through the holes you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.519
 You did it beforehand, alright, come on. 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.739
 so look at it 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.099
 all my two ops 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.180
 goodies to be used 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.889

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.470
