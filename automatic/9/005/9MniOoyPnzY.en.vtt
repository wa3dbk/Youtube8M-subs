00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello to all i'm just going to you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.240
 show how to restore settings 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.940
 of cydia so restore the sources 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.330
 and cydia settings if however 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.010
 you had a defect for example when 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 you open cydia no I 'm going to realize 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.609
 the world honey pits of cydia is that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.740
 when I magnify 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.529
 it's displayed like that and so it's 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.570
 stuck like this indefinitely he does not want 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 any more remember 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.840
 so if however maybe for 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.759
 other 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.020
 when he is ashamed and in cydia he arrives 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.219
 to access sources at packets and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 so it does not even matter when you 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 you a source for example you do not have 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.309
 no more installed applications 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 tweets themes etc 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 so it's very easy to restore 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 easily and very quickly 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.100
 cydia just just two of them 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.460
 he therefore feel flaw in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.189
 the iphone get you back to the top 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.409
 completely back to you 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:15.299
 click on var and then you click 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:20.900
 on free you click on free or 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:24.810
 clicked on happy t clicked on list 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.689
 and you who click you would not want 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 excuse me so you delete all the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:39.860
 files which is here so all his 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.860
 meaningless files except the partial folder 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.039
 so where vichy 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.549
 you delete everything except the file 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:57.450
 pastia has it so you change so 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:00.759
 to pick all that stuff 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.420
 so I 'm going here has tons of 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.420
 brief records 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.590
 yeah but well ten years ago we too 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.440
 I'm already doing on the city ​​and the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:21.579
 comedy I was staying that they did 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:27.099
 so I'm already that or released the peace 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:39.459
 hope of success was therefore removed there 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:41.410
 had so if I left and sublimate you 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.569
 in squash so local files 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:53.340
 master this noise and you remove 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:59.130
 therefore remains selected selected 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.130
 select cause always 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:15.620
 here and here I have deleted and you 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.069
 delete everything else 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:24.959
 so I followed it with brief agreements 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.719
 delete again and here's one more time 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.109
 it's done so you do 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:38.489
 ok to click on the net just 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:43.109
 in vain and there you restart your 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.859
 idea live so simple does you do 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:51.180
 i restart screws and once 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:55.230
 that you go so you can then 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.569
 access cydia easily so i'm going 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.769
 do a test right away if he 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.870
 works correctly 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.699
 I will open if God is like you 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.430
 can see so he loaded more 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.849
 quickly even and there he saves the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.849
 correctly 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:20.130
 so here I do not know you're not going 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.759
 because of the time and as you can 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.389
 you already have all the applications or 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:30.699
 well you do not look for him 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.840
 i do not know eye-fi for example eye-fi 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.879
 like this one toc 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.340
 as you can see it works 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:41.199
 correctly 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:46.789
 so there is no need to worry 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.229
 so ifile there is no problem to 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.729
 make 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.069
 you will not lose at all 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.129
 sources and customs officers all that so 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.870
 it's very convenient if you wanted 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.020
 blinds and your cydia so that he 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.590
 works exactly 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.969
 so you can do it 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.210
 continually so so every time 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:10.789
 finally if the problem comes back again or 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.879
 well persists so you redo the same 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.090
 manipulation and this will be done 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:19.569
 collection so if I'm going to do ten awards 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.029
 than in 2 for example 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:28.490
 so that's all it was fast 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:31.879
 so that was just a little 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.029

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:38.569
