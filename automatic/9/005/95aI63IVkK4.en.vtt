00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.530
 far to the east over the fields and rivers and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.929
 it makes a lonely mountain 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.500
 the dwarves are determined to claim 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.500
 their lands 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 I like visitors as much as a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.860
 hobbit but I prefer to meet them before 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.440
 May you visit me Mr. Bag at your service 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.880
 I'm surrounded by dwarves that is in them 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.879
 here or here in a movie 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.530
 so this is the hobbit you asked me 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.140
 find the fourteenth member of 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.059
 this company and I chose Mr. BolsÃ³n to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.519
 me the hobbits can pass 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.430
 unnoticed if they want what they give us 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:53.940
 a clear advantage we will take advantage of this 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.940
 opportunity to recover the adventure 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.340
 and come because average not because bilbo 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.350
 pocket 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.350
 Maybe it's because I'm afraid 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.750
 and he gives me courage 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 So that's your purpose to enter 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.930
 the mountain and what 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.150
 some would consider it incidents 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.860
 a dark power appeared in the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.860
 depths of the world 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.520
 we play the riddles and his leg 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.869
 then with less while cristian 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.430
 after eating more and more fran loses 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.430
 that we eat whole 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530
 Fair enough 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.160
 I would choose any of these dreams not 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.160
 about the most powerful army was 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.360
 silver 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.310
 a good heart I can not ask for more than 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.350
 your home was left behind 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.350
 your destiny is in front 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.990
 he could have been worse
