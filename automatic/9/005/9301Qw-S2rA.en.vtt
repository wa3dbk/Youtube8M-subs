 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.559
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.860
 hello tankers with you eustace i think 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 most of you have already seen something 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.240
 tutu 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.730
 tank level 9 heavy German which goes 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.180
 before the mouse they are going to change to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.520
 prototype mouse and I think many of you 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 already seen how it will look plum 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.660
 super test just passed yesterday 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 but I also want to express my opinion about 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.920
 this car indicator tth show 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.530
 appearance in general let's start with tth 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:56.140
 we have a gun with 225 penetration 750 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.270
 damage gun we have comes from e100 and this is me 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 surprises it surprises me very much 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.809
 but at the same time we charge 19 seconds 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.479
 accuracy scatter we have 046 on the ninth 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.259
 level for heavy well, not very good three 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.060
 seconds we have reduced gun power 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.100
 engine we have one and a half thousand horses 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.220
 but at the same time its power density is only 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.740
 eight eight horses per ton which is clearly 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.530
 affects just miserable speakers 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 maximum speed forward speed 20 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.080
 only kilometers an hour ago 15 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.509
 2000 unit strength is quite good 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.929
 armor of course good in the forehead 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.560
 hull 200 millimeters in the beams 182 would 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.350
 towers 250 pairs then towers 200 and and 50 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.590
 millimeters of harp harp we will have 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.709
 four pieces and not so easily be knocked down 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.670
 an overview of only 370 meters that 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:57.009
 certainly not very good 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.990
 again the weight of 170 tons 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.729
 imagine a ram tank will be good but 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.950
 it will be extremely slow and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.190
 small practical can just from just 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.770
 eight eight horses 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.349
 gun on the one hand a good breakthrough 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.930
 225 good 750 damage but at the same time 19 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.800
 seconds kds that me very much in 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.200
 Generally sad in appearance as you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.380
 managed to notice this is the real thing 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.150
 neither is the mouse a little different form 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.810
 armor towers we have very good 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.170
 there are screens 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.970
 we just have a huge mask 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.569
 guns in principle that upper that lower 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.750
 bronelist 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:43.180
 has a thickness of 200 millimeters 250 we 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.680
 the tower carries no vulnerabilities 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.050
 commander's turret also has a good 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.670
 armor she has armor over 200 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.800
 millimeters I again punch her 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.200
 It will also be quite problematic 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.430
 considering that there are very high after all 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.090
 this mouse is above the top armor of course not here 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.069
 about 40 millimeters and art if 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.290
 will fall here it will burn there 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.040
 will explode and with this no 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.190
 no problem but such a car 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.000
 in principle, if there is a give mausgan 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.700
 then 128 millimeter can I 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.130
 I think that this car will be very 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.290
 good considering that level nine 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.569
 maybe in the top and against it will be 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.940
 Eight sevens imagine how they 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.820
 will suffer without making your way find out this 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.549
 the car is such a motion 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.040
 if I said correctly is not strong in 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.450
 German general here is such a tanchik to everyone 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.370
 Thank you for your attention. I hope this video. 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.380
 show it to you 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.299
 friends put a finger up your 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.590
 ustaza meet again until-until
