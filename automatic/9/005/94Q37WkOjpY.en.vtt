00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.500
 Flat-panel TVs belong to the consumer to the absolute 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.579
 Leaders on the hit list of consumer electronics 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.440
 hardly any device class finds as much attention as the so-called Flat 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:14.349
 Screens 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.480
 the creation outdo themselves with technical innovations but these 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 can not hide a thing no matter how expensive it is 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.679
 At first, not all flat screen TVs shine with pin-sharp 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.539
 Pictures and a great sound 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.340
 Test de provides the viewer with the product finder as a television 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 the malle televisions were the sides in the lab in early 2010 as well 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.980
 all product lines are set 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.940
 Super they are according to very important criteria of size 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 Passes in the wall unit or not very important the important 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 Equipment features, for example, no digital photo good as the common one 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.520
 USB fan is not synonymous but after such things as the price, yes, not one 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.790
 unimportant argument 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.880
 rather Helsinki or plasma 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.530
 do i need full hd resolution or dvb-t receiver 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.650
 it is the sound 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.250
 you can understand the manual too 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.070
 What is the power consumption? 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.430
 at prices from a few hundred to over a thousand euros if you have it already 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.930
 like exactly 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.510
 the product finder reveals the test result with a mouse click 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.320
 One Euro sees the user immediately what the TV is from the special offer 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.500
 screwed and if that can 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.840
 really cheap is a quick overview of the price development 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.960
 All devices offer the constantly updated price failed 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.790
 the plague is watching the online 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.609
 they specify a minimum axinom and the average value 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.859
 and that it runs for a certain amount of time you get that with wine too 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.719
 TV of choice begins to lower the price this is the newspaper for 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:45.880
 the bargain hunters 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.360
 but even more important than the price are the test results from the testing laboratory 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.020
 Thus, the image reproduction is measured not only technically but also intensively 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.180
 rated by trained pest viewers 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 also the quality of the sound reproduction 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.710
 Handling versatility and environmental features of the equipment will be 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.440
 gladly also tested 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.020
 For example, how much or little power the TV even the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.389
 Question about toxins in the housing plays a role 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.809
 the test turns out again and again the most expensive device must be at 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.189
 far from being the best 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.969
 who wants to know exactly who can do it in the product finder on the individual 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.269
 Make comparisons and credits as a pdf file 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.629
 the prices for the SauerlÃ¤nder question 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.510
 instead of depending on the number of devices retrieved who we then cut 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.419
 but at five euros for a new package 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.579
 It will be the end of the day change any number of TVs in it 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.989
 Clearly, five euros first sounds to Pierre Aubert when we see that 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.739
 Average price for Sunday TV is around the thousand euros 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.549
 that's what the buyer spends five euros so you do not sell yourself 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.079
 well invested money 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.739
 Stiftung Warentest regularly tests new models 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.260
 therefore, the product finder is constantly updated as soon as the current one 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.929
 Results are available so databases remain up to date 8 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:12.649
 in the product finder Flat screen televisions can be found on the Internet at www Test
