device<00:05:09.750> its<00:05:10.290> own<00:05:10.470> customization<00:05:11.460> hope<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.390> said

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
device its own customization hope I said

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.230 
device its own customization hope I said
that<00:05:12.630> right<00:05:12.810> sounds<00:05:13.350> weird<00:05:13.530> but<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.880> can<00:05:15.060> make

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
that right sounds weird but you can make

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.450
