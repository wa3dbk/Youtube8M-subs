00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.339
 dear my beloved all big big 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello and today I'll show you how i am doing 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:16.440
 gel lacquer french manicure 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:18.810
 worn for up to 10 days so to us 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.400
 need system in gordon which i 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.760
 I have been using for more than a year 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.830
 the first is of course the bonder goes further 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.260
 base taste top cover in my 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.990
 the system will go two in one 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.750
 natural light white paint white 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.840
 and light light sparkles on transparent 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840
 background 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.210
 and so the first thing we do is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.710
 degreased nail plate can 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.020
 you can use ordinary alcohol 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.920
 I have a special tool from the company 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 Severin further we put bonder bonder 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.059
 is it so thin whether those 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.220
 acts as double-sided tape 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 to interlock our nail plate 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.650
 and with the very first layer of gel polish 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 neatly seal torez 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.180
 from the bunker your manicure can 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.000
 hold out much less further dry 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.370
 it in the air one minute and put 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.550
 our first cover that we will 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.650
 send to the lamp is some kind of base also 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.150
 we put with a thin layer a brush 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.950
 you can enter in this manicure wash 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.100
 any amount because this varnish is not 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.330
 air drying is very convenient 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.620
 we distribute on all fingers on all 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.660
 leg so much- . we are sure 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.440
 seal the red so your manicure 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.440
 will rush longer 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.560
 well, then we send to the lamp to dry 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.560
 our nails for one minute 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.390
 the next layer is a natural color 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.980
 make me lightweight beige also apply 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 in a thin layer and send to the lamp on 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.640
 One minute 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.879
 the next layer is french myself 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.670
 little white little lakhs 24 shades 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.319
 called dazzling french and how 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.590
 you will see i use no 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.860
 stripes i don't draw blue strong line 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.959
 smiles i just emphasize 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.700
 natural edge first layer can 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.159
 apply very very thin because 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.780
 we will put them two and the second layer 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.780
 we can fix it 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.580
 also when drawing the tip 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.470
 be sure to seal the butt this 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:09.330
 very important in my opinion this is the most 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.270
 What a classic manicure 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.070
 fits any outfit to any image 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.070
 any time of the year 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.970
 everything is ready we send in a lamp on one 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.970
 a minute 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.790
 further we duplicate the same thing we do 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.629
 and even chic just brighter and richer led 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.450
 and earlier 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.590
 we paint over the coat hanger which is possible 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.590
 we allowed in the first layer 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.140
 as you can see it's very simple if you 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.540
 afraid to dirty fingers do not be afraid 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.720
 when you take off the top sticky 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.859
 layer this is all erased also send in 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.859
 lamp for one minute 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.420
 well, then you could put top but 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.100
 it's me I love sparkles this manicure 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.590
 sunshine or in the evening 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.150
 shine and overthrow a normal day 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.520
 lighting will just seem 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.020
 classic french thin thin 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.820
 I distribute glitter as well 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.820
 seal the end to briefly 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.550
 thereby we align by the way yet 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.630
 small errors are also sent to 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.630
 lamp for one minute 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.960
 then we put our top top 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.240
 a coating that does help 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.819
 protect our manicure from scratching and 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.060
 damage and prolong his crazy 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.219
 resistance is distributed in a thin layer 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.199
 also seal the end also not 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.389
 be careful not to wear a brush 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.389
 your fringe because he already froze 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.569
 by the way these varnishes varnishes in no case 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.580
 can't shake as usual i only 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.800
 slightly turn over otherwise your varnish 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.810
 bubbles and your own will 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.639
 look not all as it 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.900
 the final coating is sent to the lamp 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.900
 for 2 minutes 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.030
 voila girls our manicure is ready for us 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.310
 just need to wipe off the top sticky layer 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.990
 degreaser absolutely not afraid that 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.050
 on something is erased here is such a he 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.300
 by the way I wash the big bottle and 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.310
 this is all a girl 10 days we can with you 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.710
 do not bathe and that's such a beauty 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.919
 it turns out the hands are a little wet but also think 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.730
 and you see sparkles sparkling 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.560
