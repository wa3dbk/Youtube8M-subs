00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:10.370
 very well here came the people like 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.370
 single drop 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:20.170
 because we are going to sublimate we are going to sublimate 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.150
 on willy wood of the dawn 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.800
 and I want to explain to you first how 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.890
 we prepare the surface for later 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.500
 problems about an easy book if we go 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.640
 to give a base of white acrylic base 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.430
 couple 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 and then once it's dry we're going to 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 Apply 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 the polymer as we put it in a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 metal surface or those these boxes 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 you wear the recyclable containers 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.580
 good they serve to contain the lacquer a 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.309
 brush that for the here there was a roller 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.040
 of high density foam rubber and what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.090
 let's do is apply evenly 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 and even the lacquer if getting right to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.880
 all the corners yes to all 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.450
 Armando once the brush or the same 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.399
 worthy place and yes, but self-level 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.490
 we do not have to put too much 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.930
 budding this is the way to spend 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 parejito without doing too much pressure 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 because if I do a lot of pressure stretched 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.440
 too much material and that does not 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.990
 It's good, I'm not going to continue because 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.350
 it does not make sense once it ends with 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.090
 this what I do is let dry 24 hours 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.039
 and let dry 3 hours here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.920
 that comes the material and then I put it 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.510
 in the oven at a temperature of 150 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.170
 degrees 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.150
 six minutes ten minutes max i wear 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.270
 I turn the oven one hundred fifty ten 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.790
 minutes and once it's cold you take it out 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.240
 in cold there I can work with that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.810
 accelerated the perfect job and once 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.000
 that dried up or that I put it in the oven 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.310
 there is a beautiful bright surface here 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 suit on purpose in this part that does not 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.020
 has lacquer that is opaque and this part 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.090
 that has the polymer lacquer for 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.790
 sublimate and I already brought a part that is 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.440
 sublimated and so we arm because what 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.230
 let's do it's actually the frame 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.440
 from the mirror and let's take this out a 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.230
 little bit and what I'm going to work with 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.780
 sheets of psuv for sublimation of 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.500
 eternal if this is one of them from the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.959
 series of line textures there are 80 new 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.310
 sheets so you can see them in the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.620
 This page that I make the sheet I'm going to 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.700
 put on the surface to sublimate 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.980
 and with the hot iron as sublimated 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.480
 any surface I will work 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.480
 making pressure 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:05.000
 the hot iron you saw that with rosana 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.579
 we said removed plates then I'm going to 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.670
 go testing see what is missing then 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.930
 I'm going to put as always clear I'm going 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.030
 from the little bit or I do not go with the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.209
 iron very very hot because I can 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.700
 burn the lacquer then I go little I'm going to 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.349
 testing and testing exactly is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:34.909
 well if mónica I can say such as 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:36.109
 a few 80 new models for me 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.620
 clarified 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.390
 You know, here, look, they look at me, 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.230
 these are divine 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.160
 is so much greater than the Japanese 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.560
 while the Hindus while I continue 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.780
 subliman a beautiful that another that we have 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.860
 What to do is not to move the sheet 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.860
 that does not move 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.050
 because the oriental one that showed us 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.230
 Monica is beautiful she was on wood 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.750
 after you can put money you can 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.570
 put dimensional 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.090
 to be able to make a good good picture 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.549
 there I think intact 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.680
 and apart I remembered something else so 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.050
 important when you in this color 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.240
 they really know what they have left when 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.460
 they are more eggs they know that it has more 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.070
 strong as it happens in the case of the long 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.560
 who is using mónica fix the sheet 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.690
 if it exists that I am, I had a little cutter 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.770
 Well, what are we going to do with this? 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.910
 I have to do is not 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.400
 mount on the other the truth we are going to 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.379
 do a bit here I do not know how we are 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.360
 of time but then what I love you 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.400
 show here we have that we never have 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.220
 time then your mónica bosch 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.530
 then once we sublimate being 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.099
 in part is what we are going to do is and 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.520
 After I have time left I keep putting a 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:07.159
 mirror I put a frame that I made 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.430
 a worn down and I worked with the 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.979
 colors of the blade with the sambayon and 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.870
 with an ocher color below 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.870
 here I would lack resources 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.389
 while you show them the magazine 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.150
 because I have put I finish here with a 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:30.960
 lima of a lot of work and I comment there 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:34.259
 it looks perfect remember 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.020
 the magazine of eternal white magazine la 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.020
 they will find in all the artistic 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.500
 what they should do if the bookseller 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.530
 he does not have it is to call by phone 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.289
 eternal and tell you the ladies are me 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.880
 asking for the white terna magazine 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.910
 magazine and the director is not 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.590
 making court signal while I 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.610
 Then he asked him for beds 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.610
 Mirror mirror who is the best 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
 sublimate 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.120
 the best and it's eternal so now they 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.479
 you can ask to see what you answer 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.849
 of record batiste since sublimated and I 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.889
 it seems that I better follow his motto and here in 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.889
 arts you there sublimando dale 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:31.099
 we continue a file with 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.099
 monica godfroid and much more arts
