the second one there is the MobileLite
g3<00:00:50.240> the<00:00:50.720> fcr<00:00:51.910> MLG<00:00:52.910> 3<00:00:53.300> what<00:00:54.260> that<00:00:54.470> one<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.710> is

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
g3 the fcr MLG 3 what that one is is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.880 
g3 the fcr MLG 3 what that one is is
basically<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:56.060> mobile<00:00:56.570> version<00:00:56.600> odds<00:00:57.350> much

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
basically the mobile version odds much

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.310 
basically the mobile version odds much
smaller<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.790> only<00:00:58.970> fits<00:00:59.329> a<00:00:59.450> couple<00:00:59.810> different

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
smaller it only fits a couple different

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.190 
smaller it only fits a couple different
sizes<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.070> cards<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:01.970> it's<00:01:02.239> meant<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.600> be<00:01:02.630> very

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
sizes of cards but it's meant to be very

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.550 
sizes of cards but it's meant to be very
much<00:01:03.500> more<00:01:03.770> portable<00:01:04.780> now<00:01:05.780> first<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.380> the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
much more portable now first is the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.040 
much more portable now first is the
regular<00:01:06.710> media<00:01:07.250> card<00:01:07.580> reader<00:01:07.640> if<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:08.810> take<00:01:08.990> a

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
regular media card reader if we take a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.040 
regular media card reader if we take a
look<00:01:09.320> here<00:01:09.620> this<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.159> still<00:01:10.610> very<00:01:11.000> small<00:01:11.600> more

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
look here this is still very small more

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.469 
look here this is still very small more
of<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.229> compact<00:01:12.770> size<00:01:13.070> here<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:13.940> this<00:01:14.120> is<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
of a compact size here but this is the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.300 
of a compact size here but this is the
universal<00:01:15.080> reader<00:01:15.350> that's<00:01:15.620> supposed<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.130> read

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
universal reader that's supposed to read

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.789 
universal reader that's supposed to read
just<00:01:16.580> about<00:01:16.700> every<00:01:17.090> card<00:01:17.330> out<00:01:17.479> there<00:01:17.750> on<00:01:18.590> the
