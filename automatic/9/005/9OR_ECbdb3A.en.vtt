00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
one of his penalties and then I decided

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.180 
one of his penalties and then I decided
to<00:06:25.870> go<00:06:25.960> cocky<00:06:26.230> and<00:06:26.410> go<00:06:26.560> down<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.830> middle<00:06:26.980> and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
to go cocky and go down the middle and

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.310 
to go cocky and go down the middle and
he<00:06:27.580> saves<00:06:27.910> it<00:06:28.090> from<00:06:28.210> me<00:06:28.420> but<00:06:28.450> what<00:06:28.720> do<00:06:28.840> we<00:06:28.870> do<00:06:29.080> we

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
he saves it from me but what do we do we

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320 
he saves it from me but what do we do we
save<00:06:29.680> it<00:06:29.890> from<00:06:30.070> vieras<00:06:30.550> penalty<00:06:30.910> even<00:06:30.940> though

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
save it from vieras penalty even though

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.580 
save it from vieras penalty even though
I<00:06:31.360> thought<00:06:31.660> that<00:06:31.810> ball<00:06:31.960> hit<00:06:32.140> the<00:06:32.230> back<00:06:32.410> of<00:06:32.440> the

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
I thought that ball hit the back of the

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.010 
I thought that ball hit the back of the
net<00:06:32.800> however<00:06:33.730> it<00:06:33.910> didn't<00:06:34.150> count<00:06:34.300> we<00:06:34.690> win<00:06:34.900> the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
net however it didn't count we win the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.510 
net however it didn't count we win the
game<00:06:35.050> and<00:06:35.470> I've<00:06:35.770> just<00:06:35.800> beaten<00:06:36.370> that

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
game and I've just beaten that

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.250 
game and I've just beaten that
absolutely<00:06:37.480> ridonculous<00:06:37.930> squad<00:06:38.620> and

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
absolutely ridonculous squad and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.200 
absolutely ridonculous squad and
Alma<00:06:39.470> team<00:06:39.680> this<00:06:39.860> year<00:06:40.070> not<00:06:40.370> too<00:06:40.610> shabby<00:06:40.910> we

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
Alma team this year not too shabby we

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.880 
Alma team this year not too shabby we
only<00:06:41.390> earn<00:06:41.720> two<00:06:41.990> shots<00:06:42.320> on<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.620> target

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
only earn two shots on the target

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.000 
only earn two shots on the target
because<00:06:43.460> we<00:06:43.730> got<00:06:43.820> one<00:06:44.090> assist<00:06:44.480> and<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:45.110> win<00:06:45.320> so

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
because we got one assist and the win so

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.220 
because we got one assist and the win so
it's<00:06:46.220> not<00:06:46.310> exactly<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:47.300> most<00:06:47.480> fruitful<00:06:48.080> of

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
it's not exactly the most fruitful of

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.680 
it's not exactly the most fruitful of
wins<00:06:48.440> but<00:06:48.650> we<00:06:48.740> do<00:06:48.860> get<00:06:49.040> two<00:06:49.220> shots<00:06:49.250> to<00:06:49.610> unlock<00:06:50.000> a

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690
