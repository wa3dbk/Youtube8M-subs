innocence three think you can probably
see<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> difference<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.710> me<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

see the difference in me that's not a
whole<00:00:44.340> lot<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> difference<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
whole lot of a difference but it is a

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.779 
whole lot of a difference but it is a
big<00:00:47.129> difference<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:47.670> you're<00:00:47.879> baking<00:00:48.710> um<00:00:49.789> I'm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it sitting right here

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.530 
it sitting right here
um<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.340> test<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> batch

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
um this is my test one from this batch

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.109 
um this is my test one from this batch
so<00:01:16.409> totally<00:01:17.009> could<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.280> done<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.790> went<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so totally could have done and I went to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.020 
so totally could have done and I went to
this<00:01:18.299> grabbed<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.400> used<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this grabbed it but this one I used the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490 
this grabbed it but this one I used the
3<00:01:21.240> tablespoon<00:01:21.720> scoop<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.259> not

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
3 tablespoon scoop and it's not

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.760 
3 tablespoon scoop and it's not
completely<00:01:23.070> over<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> edge<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> wrapper

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
completely over the edge of the wrapper

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
completely over the edge of the wrapper
but<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> 4<00:01:30.600> tablespoon<00:01:31.140> scoop

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
but if you use a 4 tablespoon scoop

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
but if you use a 4 tablespoon scoop
that's<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> make<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> completely

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that's going to make it completely

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.170 
that's going to make it completely
bubble<00:01:33.869> over<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:35.400> crazy<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> I'd<00:01:36.030> rather

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
bubble over and be crazy so I'd rather

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
bubble over and be crazy so I'd rather
have<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.750> smaller<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.320> that's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
have it a little bit smaller so that's

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.690 
have it a little bit smaller so that's
just<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> do

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
just what I do

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
just what I do
and<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> show<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.560> how<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> fill

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

my skate so what I do is hairless so you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
my skate so what I do is hairless so you
can<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.020> into<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> bowl<00:01:52.560> okay<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> take<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
can get into the bowl okay so I take I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480 
can get into the bowl okay so I take I
scooped<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:54.570> batter<00:01:55.219> then<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> actually

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
scooped up some batter then I actually

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.420 
scooped up some batter then I actually
kind<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.270> spread<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.869> inside<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
kind of spread it out inside of the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.709 
kind of spread it out inside of the
scoop<00:01:59.700> just<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:02.509> scrape<00:02:03.509> off

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
scoop just like that and then scrape off

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.380 
scoop just like that and then scrape off
the<00:02:03.750> top<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.369> scrape<00:02:05.820> off<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> sides

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the top and I scrape off the sides

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.249 
the top and I scrape off the sides
because<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.350> am<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:09.090> OCD<00:02:09.330> must'<00:02:10.080> like

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that and then just dump it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
that and then just dump it
okay<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:16.680> idea<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.280> I'll<00:02:17.340> do<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> few

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
okay that's idea so I'll do it a few

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.309 
okay that's idea so I'll do it a few
more<00:02:17.849> times<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.420> see<00:02:18.599> so<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> scooped<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
more times you can see so I scooped it

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:28.940 
more times you can see so I scooped it
up<00:02:21.230> scrape<00:02:22.879> scrape<00:02:23.879> again<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.800> pretty

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
up scrape scrape again so it's pretty

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.789 
up scrape scrape again so it's pretty
easy<00:02:29.160> once<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.390> mean<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.870> think<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.379> much

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
easy once I mean I think it's much

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.130 
easy once I mean I think it's much
easier<00:02:32.190> than<00:02:32.370> trying<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> spoon<00:02:33.569> everything

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
easier than trying to spoon everything

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.539 
easier than trying to spoon everything
evenly<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:34.980> good<00:02:36.500> mismatched<00:02:37.549> cupcakes

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
evenly and then good mismatched cupcakes

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.800 
evenly and then good mismatched cupcakes
and<00:02:38.970> stuff<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:42.750> said

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and stuff like that so but like I said

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.650 
and stuff like that so but like I said
always<00:02:43.230> test<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.069> with<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.970> smaller<00:02:45.299> scoop

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
always test it with the smaller scoop

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.930 
always test it with the smaller scoop
first<00:02:46.079> because<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.489> go<00:02:47.610> back<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
first because then you can go back and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.910 
first because then you can go back and
use<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.269> larger<00:02:48.599> scale<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.170> need<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
use the larger scale if you need to and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.210 
use the larger scale if you need to and
I<00:02:50.819> actually<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.599> bought<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.500> scoops<00:02:52.920> on

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
I actually I bought these scoops on

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
I actually I bought these scoops on
Amazon<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.090> they<00:02:54.239> were<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.319> they<00:02:55.410> were

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
Amazon and they were I think they were

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.990 
Amazon and they were I think they were
ten<00:02:55.799> dollars<00:02:56.190> each<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:58.709> can<00:02:58.950> just<00:02:59.129> just<00:02:59.849> type

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
ten dollars each you can just just type

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.970 
ten dollars each you can just just type
it<00:03:00.150> into<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.360> search<00:03:00.450> bar<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.170> my<00:03:01.650> three

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it into the search bar on my three

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.369 
it into the search bar on my three
tablespoon<00:03:02.549> scoop<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:04.049> four

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
tablespoon scoop and then four

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.830 
tablespoon scoop and then four
tablespoons<00:03:04.950> get<00:03:05.190> them<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:05.459> should<00:03:05.840> they're

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
tablespoons get them they should they're

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.690 
tablespoons get them they should they're
fairly<00:03:07.140> inexpensive<00:03:08.690> but<00:03:09.799> they<00:03:10.799> are<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.459> real

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
fairly inexpensive but they are a real

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.000 
fairly inexpensive but they are a real
time-saver<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:15.000> them<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.360> um<00:03:15.980> these<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
time-saver so I like them and um these I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.680 
time-saver so I like them and um these I
didn't<00:03:17.340> get<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.519> brand-name<00:03:17.970> ones<00:03:18.239> just

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
didn't get the brand-name ones just

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.259 
didn't get the brand-name ones just
because<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.530> don't<00:03:20.160> really<00:03:20.370> care<00:03:20.579> about<00:03:20.730> brand

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
because I don't really care about brand

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.330 
because I don't really care about brand
name<00:03:21.450> stuff<00:03:21.720> all<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.019> time<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:23.160> they<00:03:23.310> have

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
name stuff all the time but they have

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.370 
name stuff all the time but they have
the<00:03:23.730> off<00:03:23.910> side<00:03:24.239> ones<00:03:24.450> as<00:03:24.569> well<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.750> bought<00:03:25.019> I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the off side ones as well I bought I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.210 
the off side ones as well I bought I
think<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:26.100> thread<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.519> more<00:03:26.819> credible<00:03:27.060> I

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
think this thread is more credible I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.759 
think this thread is more credible I
don't<00:03:29.220> know<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:30.359> then<00:03:30.599> but<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.319> is<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:31.739> I

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
don't know and then but this is what I

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.699 
don't know and then but this is what I
use<00:03:32.069> but<00:03:32.750> this<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.870> what<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.049> prefer<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.620> this

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
use but this is what I prefer and this

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.890 
use but this is what I prefer and this
is<00:03:34.829> just<00:03:35.010> how<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.690> makes

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
is just how I do it and it's it makes

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.120 
is just how I do it and it's it makes
things<00:03:37.200> really<00:03:37.470> easy<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:38.480> mean<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.829> pretty

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
things really easy I mean this is pretty

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.000 
things really easy I mean this is pretty
much<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.810> same<00:03:43.019> amount<00:03:43.169> of<00:03:43.380> utensils<00:03:43.829> out<00:03:43.950> of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
much the same amount of utensils out of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.920 
much the same amount of utensils out of
use<00:03:44.220> anyway<00:03:44.579> because<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.970> always<00:03:45.150> use<00:03:45.389> special

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
use anyway because I always use special

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.520 
use anyway because I always use special
and<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.109> always<00:03:46.319> use<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:47.069> spoon<00:03:48.019> before<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.049> bought

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and I always use a spoon before I bought

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.500 
and I always use a spoon before I bought
the<00:03:50.209> scoop

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
the scoop

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.589 
the scoop
so<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.799> scoop<00:03:53.130> just<00:03:53.310> replaces<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.970> spoon<00:03:54.299> and

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
so the scoop just replaces the spoon and

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.449 
so the scoop just replaces the spoon and
it<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:55.260> goes<00:03:55.380> with<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.620> dishwasher<00:03:56.250> I

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
it just goes with the dishwasher I

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.050 
it just goes with the dishwasher I
haven't<00:03:56.849> had<00:03:57.000> any<00:03:57.209> problems<00:03:57.630> with<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.930> resting

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
haven't had any problems with it resting

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.740 
haven't had any problems with it resting
so<00:04:00.060> my<00:04:00.419> air<00:04:00.569> conditioner<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.139> turned<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:02.750> it's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
so my air conditioner is turned on it's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.940 
so my air conditioner is turned on it's
warm<00:04:04.019> here<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.739> Arizona<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:06.950> keep

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
warm here in Arizona so just keep

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.250 
warm here in Arizona so just keep
scooping<00:04:08.340> until<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.940> whole<00:04:09.209> thing<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.870> filled

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
scooping until the whole thing is filled

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.699 
scooping until the whole thing is filled
and<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:15.510> all<00:04:15.660> ready<00:04:15.900> they'll<00:04:16.109> go<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.289> love<00:04:16.470> it

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
and it's all ready they'll go in love it

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.920 
and it's all ready they'll go in love it
but<00:04:17.010> as<00:04:17.519> some<00:04:17.849> other<00:04:17.970> cupcakes<00:04:18.209> they<00:04:18.539> can<00:04:18.690> come

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
but as some other cupcakes they can come

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.480 
but as some other cupcakes they can come
right<00:04:19.139> now<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.590> show<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.760> later<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:23.340> is

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
right now so show you that later this is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.010 
right now so show you that later this is
just<00:04:23.669> what<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:23.969> it's<00:04:24.210> really<00:04:24.539> easy<00:04:24.719> it's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
just what I do it's really easy it's

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.500 
just what I do it's really easy it's
really

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
really

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.290 
really
and<00:04:26.050> it<00:04:26.890> produces<00:04:27.370> uniform<00:04:28.330> cupcakes<00:04:28.830> so

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
and it produces uniform cupcakes so

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.870 
and it produces uniform cupcakes so
that's<00:04:31.300> why<00:04:31.450> I<00:04:31.480> like<00:04:31.660> this<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:33.400> works<00:04:33.520> really

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
that's why I like this it works really

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.330 
that's why I like this it works really
long<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:37.360> generally<00:04:38.080> cleaner<00:04:38.530> too

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
long and it's generally cleaner too

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.970 
long and it's generally cleaner too
so<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.240> what<00:04:40.390> I<00:04:40.420> do<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:41.110> will

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
so this is what I do and this will

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.460 
so this is what I do and this will
definitely<00:04:42.550> help<00:04:42.790> prevent<00:04:43.360> your<00:04:43.990> cupcakes

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
definitely help prevent your cupcakes

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.150 
definitely help prevent your cupcakes
from<00:04:45.330> spilling<00:04:46.330> over<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.660> sides<00:04:46.980> so<00:04:47.980> I'm

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
from spilling over the sides so I'm

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.180 
from spilling over the sides so I'm
actually<00:04:48.280> gonna<00:04:48.580> put<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:49.300> little<00:04:49.660> bit<00:04:49.870> more

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
actually gonna put a little bit more

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.150 
actually gonna put a little bit more
this<00:04:51.190> one<00:04:52.140> so<00:04:53.140> that<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.410> still<00:04:53.860> have<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.010> little

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
this one so that I still have a little

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.130 
this one so that I still have a little
bit<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.430> batter<00:04:54.580> left<00:04:54.820> but<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.540> will<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.020> go

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
bit of batter left but that will just go

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.030 
bit of batter left but that will just go
-<00:04:56.350> batch<00:04:59.310> always<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:01.470> have<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.530> little<00:05:02.620> spoon

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040

rest<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.120> just<00:05:04.300> use<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.040> way<00:05:06.190> there's

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
rest and I just use so that way there's

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.040 
rest and I just use so that way there's
no<00:05:07.210> problem<00:05:07.630> it's<00:05:08.500> going<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.860> save<00:05:08.980> your<00:05:09.100> own

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
pretty much the same size and sometimes

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.680 
pretty much the same size and sometimes
we<00:05:14.290> get<00:05:14.380> stuck<00:05:14.620> inside<00:05:14.800> but<00:05:15.360> it's<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.450> same

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
we get stuck inside but it's the same

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.780 
we get stuck inside but it's the same
size<00:05:17.280> cupcake<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:20.160> shake<00:05:21.160> them<00:05:21.310> wrong<00:05:21.490> take
