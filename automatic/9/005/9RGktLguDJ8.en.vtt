00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello my name is christos you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.130
 are you on websites and in this 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.540
 Video is about the new 50 inches 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.160
 flat screen tv by sony 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.750
 I have the exact model here 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.099
 faded in and of course you will find 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 a link to the product and with the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.089
 description a lot of fun with the video that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.699
 his TV really has me 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 convinced the thin frame makes that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.369
 whole very very noble and the picture 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.689
 really nice 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.310
 I also especially like the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.060
 Processing the frame which I am very 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.260
 very high quality feels to the picture needs 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 you just can with this television 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.170
 not much to say 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.090
 It 's just perfect the picture quality 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 is so good or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.200
 the colors are so clear that one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.430
 you really do not want to let go 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.559
 Do not stop watching what 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.210
 I personally had and I can 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.399
 it at this point recommend to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.950
 Connections the tv has two usb 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.289
 connections reminds a hdmi connection 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.059
 of course for the internet as well as numerous 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.610
 audio connections and a scart connection 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 even next to it we also have one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.559
 satellite connection cable connection three 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.660
 hdmi ports so countless connections 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.579
 In addition, all connections and the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.170
 Power cable very easy to reach next to 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.210
 but of course also a slot 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280
 for a ci plus module where we go 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 smartcards such as sky and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 so on can plug in the 3d 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.330
 I have exactly that function 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.860
 watched 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 I have the device already since 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 about two weeks and I have to say 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.320
 that the function convinces me 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 I did not think that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.549
 3d is so good but it really is not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 so that you get a headache or 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.509
 otherwise something like for example in the cinema 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 that is very pleasant and you can 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.890
 really look so good if one 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 film has no 3d then you can synonymous 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.340
 simulate with the tv 3d 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.229
 that is, although the film is not 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 The TV set is designed for this purpose 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.950
 try as best we can 3d effect 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.659
 to install the function works 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.399
 also pretty good and i can do that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.720
 actually only recommend of course 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.320
 it is much better if you for example 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.000
 have a 3d blu ray and so on 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.770
 I want you the smartphone features 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 also a little something to tell about 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 For example, we have the opportunity 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 apps to install by we 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.840
 Just press on home, we come in 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.549
 You can see the menu about the apps there 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.930
 which download or we can stop 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.850
 the states we have 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.970
 I have for example youtube instagram 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.430
 facebook, etc. already installed 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.230
 what i like in the sony tv but especially 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.510
 like that here you are the Amazon 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.250
 you can have instant video app with it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.130
 then all the contents of Amazon 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.690
 be it movies or even movies 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.190
 other things you can do the whole thing 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 just look at home comfortably 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.580
 So if nothing is going on TV 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.650
 then I just sit down in the evening 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.360
 Open the app and just look there 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.440
 That's it and there is always something there 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.120
 what I like 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.290
 At the moment I'm just at it 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.030
 Breaking bad again to look through 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.160
 another interesting feature is 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.230
 among other things the social view function 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.030
 it makes the most sense if you have something 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.680
 Look what is watching a lot of them be it 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.570
 wm or eurovision 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.820
 then there could just be the social 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.709
 view button press it goes a window 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.840
 on and there then become one 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.000
 certain hashtag the last tweets 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.890
 that's a pretty cool one 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.900
 thing to look at as the others over 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.959
 think this show or 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.550
 what's going on right outside is fitting 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.170
 wm sony has a lot, of course 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.600
 Function for football fans 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.880
 packed so had for example one 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.800
 football button with her then to 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.290
 example youtube videos from the wm 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.820
 can do or to the topic wm that is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.230
 of course super interesting for all those 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.330
 to deal with the topic and 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.760
 look for more content 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.430
 we come to my favorite function 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.380
 namely screen mirroring that means 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.780
 that you open the screen of your cell phones 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.670
 I can play your TV 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.630
 I heard of the function before me 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.489
 the device had 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.440
 and then I thought okay that will 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.570
 a bit rough but me 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.489
 I am really extremely positively surprised 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.709
 the quality of the reproduction is super good 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.840
 So you do not have any pixels or anything else 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.850
 something but a really clear picture 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.890
 and it's really not slow 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.330
 so if you use it all for the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.220
 for example surfing the internet or 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.360
 just take facebook on a big one 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.130
 Check TV 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.130
 then that works really well 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.310
 that was it, too 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.170
 even though there are still plenty of 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.580
 other functions but I can 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.270
 not all of you in a video 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.830
 imagine 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.960
 I have you in my opinion now 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.480
 best features or mine 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.880
 favorite feature shown below 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.000
 For example, you can watch movies and apps via apps 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.530
 You can access series that your 3d films 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.030
 we can see that among other things 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.460
 our functions have as for example 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.080
 social view and with the holders whole 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.850
 TV experience a bit more 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.010
 could improve and a bit 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.390
 could bring variation pure 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.670
 I personally liked it very much 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.290
 concluding conclusion who for me that 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.030
 I must honestly say that I am in 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.580
 see this device no disadvantage 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.200
 even the price for 899 euro is 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.060
 completely justified and in the 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.530
 Comments are discussed that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.180
 this tv even for this price 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.440
 can beat more expensive models 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.760
 if you like it all yourself 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.020
 I wanted to take a closer look 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.120
 have it all in the description below 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.100
 on the left, that's all 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.640
 until next time your christoph here 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.640
 up
