00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
right so this one has a safety feature

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.170 
right so this one has a safety feature
so<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:24.950> won't<00:01:25.130> start<00:01:25.369> unless<00:01:25.549> your<00:01:25.759> kickstand

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
so it won't start unless your kickstand

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.429 
so it won't start unless your kickstand
is<00:01:26.270> up<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.659> at<00:01:26.750> least<00:01:26.840> one<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.170> your<00:01:27.290> breaks

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
is up and at least one of your breaks

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.800 
is up and at least one of your breaks
are<00:01:27.680> depressed<00:01:28.009> okay<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:29.600> this

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
are depressed okay so I have to so this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.370 
are depressed okay so I have to so this
is<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.990> front<00:01:30.290> rank<00:01:30.619> right<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:33.350> is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
is the front rank right here so this is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.660 
is the front rank right here so this is
an<00:01:33.560> automatic<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.490> much<00:01:34.640> easier

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
an automatic so it's so much easier

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.980 
an automatic so it's so much easier
sound<00:01:35.180> like<00:01:35.330> great<00:01:35.770> but<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:37.039> our<00:01:37.070> test<00:01:37.369> we<00:01:37.549> had

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
sound like great but for our test we had

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.440 
sound like great but for our test we had
we<00:01:38.990> had<00:01:39.020> um<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.590> stick<00:01:40.549> shift<00:01:40.789> yeah<00:01:41.119> under

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
we had um a stick shift yeah under

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.710 
we had um a stick shift yeah under
previous<00:01:41.830> right<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.369> I'm<00:01:44.149> gonna<00:01:44.240> hold<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:44.659> in

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
previous right so I'm gonna hold it in

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.240 
previous right so I'm gonna hold it in
the<00:01:44.750> front<00:01:44.960> brake<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.710> oyster<00:01:45.950> in<00:01:46.100> it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the front brake is the oyster in it

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.620 
the front brake is the oyster in it
usually<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.850> front<00:01:47.060> brake<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.420> easier

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
usually the front brake is the easier

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.490 
usually the front brake is the easier
way<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.780> go<00:01:47.960> Russ<00:01:48.200> if<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.220> sense<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.670> up<00:01:50.000> a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
way to go Russ if the sense this is up a

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.399 
way to go Russ if the sense this is up a
bottom<00:01:51.500> heavy<00:01:51.679> bike<00:01:52.509> if<00:01:53.509> you<00:01:53.750> go<00:01:53.929> at<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> back

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
bottom heavy bike if you go at the back

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.289 
bottom heavy bike if you go at the back
brake<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:55.100> lot<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.549> times<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.880> bike<00:01:56.090> will

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
brake a lot of the times the bike will

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.840 
brake a lot of the times the bike will
jump<00:01:56.569> up<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.890> might<00:01:58.039> actually<00:01:58.220> flip<00:01:58.549> over

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
jump up and you might actually flip over

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.300 
jump up and you might actually flip over
so<00:01:59.119> that's<00:01:59.240> bad<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.350> I've<00:02:00.619> got<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.830> break-in

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
so that's bad so I've got the break-in

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.039 
so that's bad so I've got the break-in
actually<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.090> opposite<00:02:02.539> is<00:02:02.780> it

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
actually it's just the opposite is it

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.899 
actually it's just the opposite is it
the<00:02:03.140> obvious<00:02:03.500> yeah<00:02:04.009> if<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.429> look<00:02:04.580> if<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.759> put

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
the obvious yeah if you look if you put

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.880 
the obvious yeah if you look if you put
the<00:02:05.030> front<00:02:05.270> brake<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:05.659> first<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.530> bike<00:02:06.709> will

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the front brake in first the bike will

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.109 
the front brake in first the bike will
have<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.100> tendency<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.549> flip<00:02:07.700> up<00:02:07.850> because<00:02:08.030> the

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
have the tendency to flip up because the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.460 
have the tendency to flip up because the
brakes<00:02:08.299> lock<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.019> in<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.170> rear<00:02:09.319> wheel

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
brakes lock in and in a rear wheel

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.410 
brakes lock in and in a rear wheel
continues<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.190> move<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.640> but<00:02:11.030> that's<00:02:11.180> okay

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
continues to move so but that's okay

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.759 
continues to move so but that's okay
well<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> guess<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.110> don't<00:02:12.290> belong<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.500> about

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
well I guess I don't belong in about

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.699 
well I guess I don't belong in about
