hello there I just got that I dog
welcome<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.879> that<00:00:05.879> thing<00:00:06.480> where<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.470> go<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.519> run

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
welcome to that thing where I go and run

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.839 
welcome to that thing where I go and run
away<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.599> circles<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> bunch<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.950> places<00:00:11.309> so

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
away in circles in a bunch of places so

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.049 
away in circles in a bunch of places so
I<00:00:12.120> did<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.170> envelope<00:00:13.799> previously<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
I did this envelope previously and the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
I did this envelope previously and the
idea<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.719> if<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.379> didn't<00:00:16.619> watch<00:00:16.710> that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
idea of this if you didn't watch that

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.910 
idea of this if you didn't watch that
video<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:18.140> trained<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.500> different<00:00:19.800> place

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
video is trained in a different place

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.660 
video is trained in a different place
every<00:00:20.220> round<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:21.570> group<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> zombies<00:00:22.470> which<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
every round or group of zombies which is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.220 
every round or group of zombies which is
every<00:00:23.939> round<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> chain<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.720> when<00:00:24.869> fruit

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
every round for a chain on it when fruit

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.650 
every round for a chain on it when fruit
and<00:00:25.650> knocked<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.400> its<00:00:26.699> cetera<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.109> first<00:00:29.099> place

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
and knocked in its cetera so first place

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.830 
and knocked in its cetera so first place
I'm<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> right<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:32.070> right<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:33.390> here

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
I'm doing is right here right in here

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
I'm doing is right here right in here
that<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.440> upside<00:00:34.710> um<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.880> don't<00:00:36.180> know<00:00:36.300> I've

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that is not upside um I don't know I've

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.049 
that is not upside um I don't know I've
base<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.110> some<00:00:37.260> reason<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:39.350> yeah<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.620> place

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
base for some reason so yeah this place

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.220 
base for some reason so yeah this place
surprisingly<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.540> easier<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
surprisingly it's much easier than you

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.279 
surprisingly it's much easier than you
think<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> yeah<00:00:45.480> you'll<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> just

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
think so yeah you'll see you can just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.250 
think so yeah you'll see you can just
run<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.309> u-shape<00:00:48.320> awesomeness<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
run this little u-shape awesomeness and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.510 
run this little u-shape awesomeness and
obviously<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.379> wouldn't<00:00:52.620> suggest<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
obviously I wouldn't suggest it if you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.119 
obviously I wouldn't suggest it if you
do<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.420> every<00:00:55.079> other<00:00:55.110> place<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.070> could

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
do this as every other place you could

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
do this as every other place you could
think<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.530> Colin<00:00:58.609> lager<00:00:59.609> area<00:01:00.350> stuff

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
think of like Colin lager area stuff

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950 
think of like Colin lager area stuff
like<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:01.980> better<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
like that much better but I don't know I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
like that much better but I don't know I
wanted<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> start<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.909> hardest

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
wanted to start out with the hardest

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.399 
wanted to start out with the hardest
training<00:01:06.960> spot<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.500> could<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
training spot that I could because I

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.820 
training spot that I could because I
don't<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:11.570> yeah<00:01:12.570> good

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.460 

actually<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.730> don't<00:01:16.790> know<00:01:17.000> maybe<00:01:17.750> because<00:01:17.870> I

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
actually I don't know maybe because I

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.230 
actually I don't know maybe because I
wouldn't<00:01:19.130> want<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> easy<00:01:19.790> ones<00:01:20.060> that

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
wouldn't want to do the easy ones that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.840 
wouldn't want to do the easy ones that
fails<00:01:20.600> right<00:01:20.990> away<00:01:21.200> after<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.620> so<00:01:22.370> yeah<00:01:22.670> I'm

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
fails right away after that so yeah I'm

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.030 
fails right away after that so yeah I'm
not<00:01:23.000> gonna<00:01:23.120> be<00:01:23.240> shooting<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.720> really

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
not gonna be shooting it really

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.320 
not gonna be shooting it really
exceptional<00:01:25.040> right<00:01:25.310> there<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:26.030> not<00:01:26.210> gonna

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330

exceptional right there I'm not gonna
shoot<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.900> kill<00:01:26.930> at<00:01:27.590> least<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.160> look<00:01:28.880> at<00:01:29.030> this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.560 
shoot to kill at least and look at this
I<00:01:29.620> found<00:01:30.620> this<00:01:30.800> to<00:01:30.950> be<00:01:30.980> funny<00:01:31.220> because<00:01:31.580> none<00:01:32.540> of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
I found this to be funny because none of

walked<00:01:51.290> by<00:01:51.410> myself<00:01:51.770> awesome<00:01:52.450> I'm<00:01:53.450> just

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
walked by myself awesome I'm just

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.480 
walked by myself awesome I'm just
wondering<00:01:53.900> if<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.560> want<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.800> see<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:55.280> any

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
wondering if you want to see this on any

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.460 
wondering if you want to see this on any
other<00:01:56.060> map<00:01:56.950> because<00:01:58.150> um<00:01:59.150> knocked<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.380> only

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
other map because um knocked is the only

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.859 
other map because um knocked is the only
one<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:01.220> could<00:02:01.610> really<00:02:01.760> do<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.420> wouldn't

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
one that I could really do I wouldn't

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.740 
one that I could really do I wouldn't
take<00:02:03.050> long<00:02:03.410> at<00:02:03.619> all<00:02:03.710> because<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.760> just<00:02:04.910> takes<00:02:05.510> a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
take long at all because it just takes a

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.690 
take long at all because it just takes a
couple<00:02:06.110> minutes<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.920> get<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.430> round

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
couple minutes to get up to this round

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.850 
couple minutes to get up to this round
because<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.990> see<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.350> rounds<00:02:09.649> don't

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
because you can see the rounds don't

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.030 
because you can see the rounds don't
take<00:02:10.040> that<00:02:10.190> long<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:11.060> around<00:02:12.050> 24<00:02:12.620> zombies

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
take that long and around 24 zombies

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.460 
take that long and around 24 zombies
pretty<00:02:14.030> simple<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.840> last<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.380> do

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
pretty simple so the last one I can do

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.010 
pretty simple so the last one I can do
of<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.970> you're<00:02:17.300> all<00:02:17.420> set<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.780> to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
of this is not you're all set have to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.000 
of this is not you're all set have to
spend<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.070> an<00:02:19.220> hour<00:02:19.340> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.739> 25<00:02:21.739> or

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
spend like an hour going to 25 or

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.370 
spend like an hour going to 25 or
something<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:23.300> yeah<00:02:23.420> another<00:02:23.750> u-shape

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
something so yeah another u-shape

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.740 
something so yeah another u-shape
u-shape<00:02:24.920> seems<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.670> best<00:02:26.390> way<00:02:26.690> to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
u-shape seems to be the best way to
