and in between the barriers it's great I
think<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.420> going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.569> be

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
think that we know it's going to be

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.720 
think that we know it's going to be
unpredictable<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.380> weekend<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.490> we're

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
unpredictable this weekend and so we're

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.330 
unpredictable this weekend and so we're
used<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.390> last<00:02:18.570> few<00:02:19.050> races<00:02:19.340> no
