00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
to others but sometimes we forget that

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.060

what makes us look the most appealing is

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.790 
what makes us look the most appealing is
just<00:04:40.400> us<00:04:40.610> being<00:04:40.940> ourselves<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.320> find<00:04:42.680> it

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
just us being ourselves and I find it

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.550 
just us being ourselves and I find it
crazy<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.610> am<00:04:43.880> finding<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:44.870> hard<00:04:45.410> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
crazy that I am finding it so hard and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.740 
crazy that I am finding it so hard and
so<00:04:45.680> emotional<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.490> talk<00:04:46.520> about<00:04:47.090> something

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
so emotional to talk about something

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.460 
so emotional to talk about something
that<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:48.169> so<00:04:48.580> simple<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.750> obvious<00:04:53.470> it's

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
that is so simple and so obvious it's

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.590 
that is so simple and so obvious it's
like<00:04:54.740> we're<00:04:54.889> all<00:04:55.040> hiding<00:04:55.370> from<00:04:55.730> our<00:04:55.910> masks

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
like we're all hiding from our masks

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.659 
like we're all hiding from our masks
from<00:04:56.780> our<00:04:57.020> fears<00:04:57.440> from<00:04:57.710> our<00:04:57.860> deepest<00:04:58.430> thoughts

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
from our fears from our deepest thoughts

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.480 
from our fears from our deepest thoughts
because<00:04:59.240> we<00:04:59.870> don't<00:05:00.110> want<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.740> appear

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
because we don't want to appear

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.150 
because we don't want to appear
vulnerable<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.300> society<00:05:02.900> but<00:05:03.500> if<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:03.950> is

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
vulnerable to society but if this is

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.030 
vulnerable to society but if this is

vulnerable then call me out on it

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.370 
vulnerable then call me out on it
because<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.610> think<00:05:07.850> this<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.480> strength<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:09.020> think
