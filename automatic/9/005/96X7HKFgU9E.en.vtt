00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the specs before I'm not gonna go into

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.650 
the specs before I'm not gonna go into
great<00:00:52.590> detail<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.820> keep<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> swearing

value for the dollar but is the ps4
really<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.180> far<00:01:00.510> behind<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.170> behind<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
really that far behind if not behind it

the<00:01:49.710> GPU<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> bottleneck<00:01:51.149> unless<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the GPU that's a bottleneck unless you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.499 
the GPU that's a bottleneck unless you
have<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.590> anemic<00:01:53.310> central<00:01:54.000> processor

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
have a really anemic central processor

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
have a really anemic central processor
or<00:01:54.689> CPU<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.770> mean<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:56.729> make<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.639 
or CPU so I mean it could make a
difference<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.840> we'll<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> lot<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
difference I think we'll see a lot of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.520 
difference I think we'll see a lot of
that<00:01:58.920> difference<00:01:59.509> mostly<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.840> exclusive

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that difference mostly with exclusive

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.530 
that difference mostly with exclusive
titles<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> PlayStation<00:02:02.820> 4<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.270> may<00:02:03.390> not

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
titles for the PlayStation 4 we may not

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.420 
titles for the PlayStation 4 we may not
see<00:02:03.780> multi<00:02:04.079> plots<00:02:04.380> may<00:02:04.649> look<00:02:04.890> exactly<00:02:05.189> the

see multi plots may look exactly the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.880 
see multi plots may look exactly the
same<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.750> exclusives<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> may<00:02:07.829> see

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
same but with exclusives you may see

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.400 
same but with exclusives you may see
that<00:02:08.550> performance<00:02:09.090> boost<00:02:09.390> kick<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.959> with

that performance boost kick in with

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.040 
that performance boost kick in with
PlayStation<00:02:11.039> 4<00:02:11.250> games<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:11.910> let's<00:02:12.270> talk<00:02:12.569> RAM

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
PlayStation 4 games now let's talk RAM

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.490 
PlayStation 4 games now let's talk RAM
because

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
because

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
because
even<00:02:13.740> though<00:02:13.890> both<00:02:14.160> systems<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.150> eight

even though both systems have eight
gigabytes<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.990> RAM<00:02:16.230> I've<00:02:16.440> talked<00:02:16.680> about<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
gigabytes of RAM I've talked about that

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.150

now<00:02:24.480> both<00:02:24.720> systems<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> kegel<00:02:25.650> bytes<00:02:25.800> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920

now<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.620> Xbox<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.490> they<00:02:44.700> say<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> their

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
now the Xbox one they say that their

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.910 
now the Xbox one they say that their
trick<00:02:45.570> up<00:02:45.720> their<00:02:45.750> sleeve<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.320> get<00:02:46.440> around<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
trick up their sleeve to get around the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.190 
trick up their sleeve to get around the
slower<00:02:47.370> ddr3<00:02:48.239> memory<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.630> they're<00:02:48.720> using<00:02:48.900> is

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
slower ddr3 memory that they're using is

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940 
slower ddr3 memory that they're using is
that<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.040> GPU<00:02:50.459> has<00:02:50.730> esram<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.140> 32<00:02:52.650> megabytes

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
that the GPU has esram in a 32 megabytes

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.680 
that the GPU has esram in a 32 megabytes
of<00:02:53.250> esram<00:02:53.700> excuse<00:02:54.239> me<00:02:54.390> embedded<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> okay

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
of esram excuse me embedded on it okay

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.570 
of esram excuse me embedded on it okay
I'm<00:02:57.690> hearing<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.680> helps<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.310> boost

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
I'm hearing that that helps that boost

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.570 
I'm hearing that that helps that boost
the<00:03:00.000> throughput<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.989> performance<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.770> lot<00:03:01.950> but

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the throughput and performance a lot but

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.979 
the throughput and performance a lot but
at<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> same<00:03:02.940> time<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.360> still<00:03:03.540> has<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> go

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
at the same time it still has to go

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.229 
at the same time it still has to go
through<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.230> slower<00:03:04.739> ddr3<00:03:05.459> memory<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.030> that

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
through that slower ddr3 memory so that

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.449 
through that slower ddr3 memory so that
that<00:03:06.420> could<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> bottleneck<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.830> that

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that could be a bottleneck so is that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.150 
that could be a bottleneck so is that
esram<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.630> gonna<00:03:09.870> make<00:03:10.620> up<00:03:10.830> for<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
esram really gonna make up for the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.750 
esram really gonna make up for the
slower<00:03:12.110> ddr3<00:03:13.110> memory<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.800> kind<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.100> you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
slower ddr3 memory it just kind of you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.520 
slower ddr3 memory it just kind of you
know<00:03:14.880> I'm<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.360> an<00:03:15.540> engineer<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.260> I'm<00:03:16.320> not<00:03:16.500> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
know I'm not an engineer and I'm not a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.039 
know I'm not an engineer and I'm not a

programmer if anyone out there is will

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.300 
programmer if anyone out there is will
that<00:03:19.080> make<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> difference<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:20.190> I'm

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that make a difference because I'm

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.100 
that make a difference because I'm
hearing<00:03:20.580> conflicting<00:03:21.480> stories<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:22.080> that

hearing conflicting stories on that
esram<00:03:22.709> some<00:03:23.040> people<00:03:23.250> say<00:03:23.400> yeah<00:03:23.670> you'll<00:03:24.269> barely

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
esram some people say yeah you'll barely

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.150 
esram some people say yeah you'll barely
notice<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.049> difference<00:03:25.320> between<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> Xbox

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
notice the difference between the Xbox

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.729 
notice the difference between the Xbox
one<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.580> ps4<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.660> people<00:03:28.080> say<00:03:28.260> no<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.620> gonna
