00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.079
 in the dawn of blindness 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.729

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.789
 different sculptures of international artists and here there is that a 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.749
 space to worship you alarte so put a lot of quality 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.110
 facing the caribbean sea on a cliff nissen these contemporary sculptures 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.409
 with abstract style 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.549
 but that I would give the highest area of ​​island women twenty meters above 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:48.690
 sea ​​level 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720
 right here where I'm walking 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.250
 there is a plaque where it is indicated that it is the first place where the first year of 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.500
 psoe taca our country to 15 years of 2000 was received to the did not get with 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.400
 much success east 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.060
 basically here 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
 it's mainly the first ray of sunshine in our country 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.060
 and that we are appreciating that dedicated temple 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.580
 a goddess and being the goddess of the abundance of the multilaterality of the 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.710
 fertility 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.980
 methods is basically a symbol very economically sanitized 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.790
 never higher or points 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.820
 and this space is still considered a special place magnificently then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 many people still minimal leave floral offerings before chile ideally 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.600
 It feels a very special life because despite being all that is 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.680
 the sea 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.130
 true and it feels a quite positive virulence 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.799
 and inside this blue point sculptural space 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.429
 you can also appreciate the erosion of the sea and the wind towards the mountain 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.920
 Each of the 26 sculptures of international artists receive a 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.850
 special care for the corrosion of the sea 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.200
 very good conditions as it is called freedom this is 5 meters high 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200
