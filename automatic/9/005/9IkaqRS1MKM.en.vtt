00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.460 
reduction block printing this is a
technique<00:00:06.980> Picasso<00:00:07.790> used<00:00:08.060> it<00:00:08.420> is<00:00:08.840> similar<00:00:09.290> to

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
technique Picasso used it is similar to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.560 
technique Picasso used it is similar to
the<00:00:09.590> multi-block<00:00:10.250> multiple<00:00:10.790> color<00:00:11.030> technique

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
the multi-block multiple color technique

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.870 
the multi-block multiple color technique
I<00:00:11.750> talked<00:00:12.020> about<00:00:12.140> earlier<00:00:12.470> except<00:00:13.430> you<00:00:13.580> just

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
I talked about earlier except you just

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.750 
I talked about earlier except you just
use<00:00:14.120> one<00:00:14.420> block<00:00:14.690> you<00:00:15.680> start<00:00:16.039> out<00:00:16.190> with<00:00:16.340> a<00:00:16.400> plain

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
use one block you start out with a plain

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.510 
use one block you start out with a plain
block<00:00:17.090> uncut<00:00:17.870> or<00:00:18.080> maybe<00:00:18.410> slightly<00:00:18.890> carved

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
block uncut or maybe slightly carved

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.990 
block uncut or maybe slightly carved
then<00:00:20.000> print<00:00:20.390> one<00:00:20.690> color<00:00:21.250> you<00:00:22.250> carve<00:00:22.580> some<00:00:22.820> more

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
then print one color you carve some more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.730 
then print one color you carve some more
on<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.210> block<00:00:23.420> then<00:00:23.870> print<00:00:24.170> another<00:00:24.410> color

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
on the block then print another color

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.120 
on the block then print another color
and<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.400> on<00:00:25.580> as<00:00:26.320> with<00:00:27.320> other<00:00:27.470> multicolor

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
and so on as with other multicolor

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.010 
and so on as with other multicolor
techniques<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.000> start<00:00:29.330> with<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.600> lightest

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
techniques you start with the lightest

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.380 
techniques you start with the lightest
color<00:00:30.260> first<00:00:30.650> then<00:00:31.190> move<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.520> darker<00:00:32.059> colors

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
color first then move to darker colors

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.590 
color first then move to darker colors
the<00:00:33.320> challenge<00:00:33.829> is<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.429> cannot<00:00:34.760> go<00:00:35.030> back<00:00:35.300> and

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the challenge is you cannot go back and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.630 
the challenge is you cannot go back and
print<00:00:35.839> more<00:00:36.019> of<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.289> first<00:00:36.589> color<00:00:36.829> after<00:00:37.219> you

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
print more of the first color after you

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.790 
print more of the first color after you
start<00:00:37.999> carving<00:00:38.480> for<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.719> second<00:00:39.079> color<00:00:39.260> so

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
start carving for the second color so

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:50.150 
start carving for the second color so
your<00:00:39.920> number<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.399> prints<00:00:40.819> is<00:00:40.940> limited
