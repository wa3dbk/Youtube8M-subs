been happening at first I thought it was

car<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> started<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> investigate<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.870> took

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

the ghost has been reported it only took

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.389 
the ghost has been reported it only took
two<00:00:54.360> days<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.140> found<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> track<00:00:56.160> them

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
two days but I found a way to track them

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.500 
two days but I found a way to track them
you<00:00:57.329> heard<00:00:57.510> me<00:00:57.660> correctly<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.320> said<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.510> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you heard me correctly I said them you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.900 
you heard me correctly I said them you
see<00:01:00.719> James<00:01:01.590> wasn't<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> first<00:01:02.219> ghost<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
see James wasn't the first ghost on the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.080 
see James wasn't the first ghost on the
island<00:01:03.359> there<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:03.750> many<00:01:04.019> others<00:01:05.090> while

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
island there are many others while

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.429 
island there are many others while
looking<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.900> wronged<00:01:07.200> me<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
looking for the one that wronged me I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.820 
looking for the one that wronged me I
stumbled<00:01:08.010> upon<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.460> old<00:01:08.580> troublesome<00:01:09.119> truck<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
stumbled upon an old troublesome truck I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.609 
stumbled upon an old troublesome truck I
filed<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> performed<00:01:11.549> tests

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
filed and performed tests

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.499 
filed and performed tests
nothing<00:01:13.619> physical<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.189> harm<00:01:14.460> him<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
nothing physical can harm him but I

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.060 
nothing physical can harm him but I
found<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.020> plasma-based<00:01:16.530> static

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
found that a plasma-based static

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
found that a plasma-based static
discharge<00:01:17.640> has<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> negative<00:01:18.210> effect<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.750> them

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
discharge has a negative effect on them

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.039 
discharge has a negative effect on them
they<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.420> weakens

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
they don't like it you see it weakens

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.830 
they don't like it you see it weakens
them<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> figure<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.390> weakened

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
them so I figure if they can be weakened

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.679 
them so I figure if they can be weakened
they<00:01:25.380> could<00:01:25.560> probably<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:26.040> caught<00:01:26.570> after<00:01:27.570> all

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
they could probably be caught after all

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
they could probably be caught after all
I<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.560> kill<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> ghost<00:01:29.130> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I don't think you can kill a ghost it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.770 
I don't think you can kill a ghost it's
already<00:01:30.299> dead

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
already dead

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.740 
already dead
I<00:01:31.729> built<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> containment<00:01:33.150> unit<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.659> my

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I built a containment unit in my

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
I built a containment unit in my
workshop<00:01:34.259> where<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:34.770> put<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
workshop where I could put the go so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
workshop where I could put the go so
I've<00:01:35.520> ever<00:01:35.670> caught<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.530> know<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.890> are

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I've ever caught one know what they are

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
I've ever caught one know what they are
made<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.549> created<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.060> small<00:01:39.240> trap<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
made of I created a small trap that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
made of I created a small trap that
works<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> magnet<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.920> pull<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> ghosts

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
works like a magnet to pull the ghosts

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.289 
works like a magnet to pull the ghosts
inside

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
inside

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960 
inside
I<00:01:42.590> waited<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.860> three<00:01:44.070> days<00:01:44.280> before<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.729> ghost

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I waited for three days before the ghost

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.960 
I waited for three days before the ghost
was<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.600> spot<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.579> equipment

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
was in the right spot the equipment

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
was in the right spot the equipment
requires<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> power<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.619> heavy

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
requires a lot of power and very heavy

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
requires a lot of power and very heavy
so<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> had<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> wait<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> ghosts<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> come

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
so I had to wait for the ghosts to come

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.149 
so I had to wait for the ghosts to come
