00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.660
 Group 5 is finally out there that is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.859
 now no déjà vu no because review 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.679
 we have already given you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.259
 however, for the pc version of the xbox 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.160
 360 played that came only before 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.289
 few weeks out 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.039
 So now bring the review 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 to the 360 versions and de facto can 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.260
 We actually have the pc review yet 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.840
 but import it with others 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 and then you would not 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.590
 difference remember for the game 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 it is not changed big it is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 Of course, only the control it 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 adapted to the controller but the rest 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.629
 that is actually accurate 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 I can now here right now 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.879
 actually our pc version review 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.070
 That's a really difficult word to refer to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.469
 and lets say you actually look 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 the on 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 but of course I want to talk about that here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.760
 Control the xbox 360 talk about the game 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 in itself is actually just as good 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.210
 however, and I can do that right here 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.219
 say if you have the opportunity that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 playing on a pc is then playing 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.420
 bitter please on the pc because the xbox 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 360 control as well adjusted as you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 I do not think she is 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.760
 it works is a control the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.689
 very awkward is the very works 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.490
 like you have to work around that 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.840
 limitation of a controller 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.340
 The developer has a damn good one 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 I really want to do a job 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.950
 no longer in the negative 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 show that in such a game on the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.040
 To bring a console is from the developer 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.390
 status forth from how do I build mine 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.390
 Build up feel for the console of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.210
 a pc is damned about that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.229
 interesting step am damned 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.479
 I have to say that's it 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.840
 but it does not work 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.539
 really so you play it and first 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.549
 it's okay interesting how it is 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.289
 was made on a gate and after a 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.360
 play some games then I would 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.689
 now prefer to play the pc version 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.799
 she looks a little better 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.649
 works in any case more fluid 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.360
 as far as the steering is concerned and that is 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.769
 actually my whole review for the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.920
 xbox 360 version 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.239
 because the game itself we have with 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.489
 the pc version that you can like 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.340
 Look here is of course linked in 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.430
 the description of the game is good that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.709
 Game is good with the negative points 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.870
 which I called then but the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 xbox 360 version that is unfortunately 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 even worse than my opinion 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.120
 after the control works though 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.400
 but not the same as a mouse 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.750
 and keyboard works and therefore 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.959
 you can recommend 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.120
 Tropico 5 on the pc to buy the xbox 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.430
 360 version or the console versions 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.549
 I would personally say that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.640
 advise against 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.060
 I personally think that such a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.459
 game with mouse should be played 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.319
 if you only have 360 ​​now and say now 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.510
 actually, I'm fine with it 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.329
 Such control then you can tropico 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.980
 five recommend you as a game but who 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.079
 The possibility should be there on everyone 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.750
 buy case where there are mice and 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.889
 keyboards are available at the pc 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.489
 magical on the pc I like 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.310
 help 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.569
 I know that a short interview but me 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.400
 I do not know what else to say about it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.260
 We should have already discussed the game 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.660
 and that's why I have only the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.980
 Control handles for the 360 me 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.139
 hope I could you continue anyway 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.549
 help as I said if you again 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.620
 want to deal with the game 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.389
 you like our pc review I look at 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.400

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.319

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.639
 on our website we answer 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.349
 I like to have there before you 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.690
 You can write a review of yourself 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.160
