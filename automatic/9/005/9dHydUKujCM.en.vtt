00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
our big stars but one of the main points

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.890 
our big stars but one of the main points
of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> PES<00:02:20.250> 2010<00:02:20.580> campaign<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.599> year<00:02:21.660> has

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
of the PES 2010 campaign this year has

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.500 
of the PES 2010 campaign this year has
been<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.319> include<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> fan<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.970> idea<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.390> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
been to include the fan the idea is that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
been to include the fan the idea is that
behind<00:02:25.019> every<00:02:25.200> great<00:02:25.470> moment<00:02:26.010> easier<00:02:26.370> to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
behind every great moment easier to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:40.339 
behind every great moment easier to
perform<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> game<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.319> fan<00:02:39.349> it's

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
perform in the game the fan it's

00:02:40.349 --> 00:03:05.750 
perform in the game the fan it's
impossible<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.920> love<00:02:41.160> you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.460 

so<00:03:06.760> basically<00:03:07.000> what<00:03:07.210> we've<00:03:07.330> got<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.780> our

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
so basically what we've got is our

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.020 
so basically what we've got is our
original<00:03:08.620> game<00:03:09.370> footage<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.940> we've

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
original game footage that we've

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.500 
original game footage that we've
captured<00:03:10.270> from<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.780> xbox<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.390> very

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
captured from the xbox and in the very

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.510 
captured from the xbox and in the very
issues<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.140> we've<00:03:14.290> died<00:03:14.470> around<00:03:14.620> Europe<00:03:15.070> we

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
issues that we've died around Europe we

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.060 
issues that we've died around Europe we
show<00:03:16.210> our<00:03:16.240> professional<00:03:16.930> footballers<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
show our professional footballers the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.040 
show our professional footballers the
positions<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.820> we've<00:03:22.000> also<00:03:22.180> shot<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> series

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
positions and we've also shot a series

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.670 
positions and we've also shot a series
of<00:03:23.670> game<00:03:24.670> fans<00:03:25.030> as<00:03:25.240> well<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:26.110> place

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.610 

essentially<00:03:29.680> my<00:03:29.800> job<00:03:30.070> is<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:31.140> create<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
essentially my job is to create the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.050 
essentially my job is to create the
transition<00:03:33.190> from<00:03:33.370> all<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.760> these<00:03:33.880> different

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
transition from all of these different

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.230 
transition from all of these different
layers<00:03:34.620> using<00:03:35.670> positive<00:03:36.670> software<00:03:37.060> called

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
layers using positive software called

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.610 
layers using positive software called
noob<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:39.720> basically<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.900> looks<00:03:41.380> like<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
noob and basically this looks like a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.260 
noob and basically this looks like a
little<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.220> tree<00:03:42.520> that<00:03:42.550> runs<00:03:42.850> from<00:03:42.940> top<00:03:43.240> to

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
little a tree that runs from top to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.510 
little a tree that runs from top to
bottom<00:03:43.650> allows<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.010> build<00:03:45.130> all<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
bottom allows you to build all the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.850 
bottom allows you to build all the
different<00:03:45.850> layers<00:03:45.970> together<00:03:46.470> finally<00:03:47.470> ending

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
different layers together finally ending

00:03:47.860 --> 00:04:39.240 
different layers together finally ending
up

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250
