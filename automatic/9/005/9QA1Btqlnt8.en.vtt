00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.770 

well<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.399> cue<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> rotate<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> way<00:01:03.719> around

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
well I cue the rotate all the way around

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.500 
well I cue the rotate all the way around
to<00:01:04.260> make

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.320 

or<00:01:08.510> I<00:01:08.570> can<00:01:08.630> rotate<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.290> item<00:01:09.619> itself<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.970> top

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
or I can rotate the item itself the top

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.530 
or I can rotate the item itself the top
piece<00:01:11.600> around<00:01:13.030> someday<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.180> was<00:01:14.390> hiring

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
piece around someday I was hiring

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.149 
piece around someday I was hiring
trouble<00:01:14.930> with<00:01:15.080> which<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.530> pretty<00:01:15.740> much<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:16.100> a

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
trouble with which is pretty much of a

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.359 
trouble with which is pretty much of a
downside<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.909> if<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.570> bigger<00:01:17.780> phone

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
downside is if you have a bigger phone

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.830 
downside is if you have a bigger phone
you're<00:01:19.369> not<00:01:19.580> going<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.909> complete<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.509> full

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
you're not going to complete the full

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.130 
you're not going to complete the full
rotation<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.310> what<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.520> had<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:22.790> do<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:23.899> my

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
rotation so what I had to do with my

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.760 
rotation so what I had to do with my
iPhone<00:01:24.470> always<00:01:24.740> put<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:25.520> kind<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:26.090> towards<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
iPhone always put it kind of towards the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
iPhone always put it kind of towards the
top<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.190> know<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:28.490> see<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:28.729> can

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
top and you know you can see I can

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.270 
top and you know you can see I can
rotate<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.299> completely<00:01:29.899> around<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.530> for

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
rotate a completely around and for

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
capable of rotating it and it still has

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.940 
capable of rotating it and it still has
a<00:01:44.990> great<00:01:45.170> grip<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.770> itself<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:47.619> this<00:01:48.619> also

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
a great grip to it itself to this also

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.130 
a great grip to it itself to this also
works<00:01:49.310> for<00:01:49.490> tablets<00:01:50.119> but<00:01:50.420> once<00:01:50.690> again<00:01:50.810> as

only<00:02:13.070> real<00:02:13.250> complaint<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.850> had<00:02:14.090> was<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> fact

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
only real complaint I had was the fact

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.050 
only real complaint I had was the fact
that<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.410> couldn't<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.070> rotate<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.760> my<00:02:16.820> eyes

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that I couldn't really rotate in my eyes

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.220 
that I couldn't really rotate in my eyes
on<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.810> 360<00:02:18.500> degrees<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.190> got<00:02:19.430> stuck<00:02:20.230> because

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
on the 360 degrees it got stuck because

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.870 
on the 360 degrees it got stuck because
it's<00:02:21.500> too<00:02:21.680> big<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.220> guess<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.580> feel<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.850> a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's too big so I guess I feel have a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.850 
it's too big so I guess I feel have a
bigger<00:02:23.090> phone<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> iphone<00:02:23.960> 4s<00:02:24.290> your<00:02:24.650> phone
