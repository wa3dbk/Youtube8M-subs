00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
going to start with the load out so base

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.069 
going to start with the load out so base

to<00:01:16.289> play<00:01:16.649> extinction<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.280> basically<00:01:17.670> they

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
to play extinction so basically they

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.310 
to play extinction so basically they
really<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.630> pulling<00:01:19.079> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
really want you to be pulling the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.959 
really want you to be pulling the
campaign<00:01:19.950> i<00:01:19.979> guess<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> world<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.820> war

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
campaign i guess in the world at war

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.609 
campaign i guess in the world at war
that's<00:01:21.119> how<00:01:21.270> zombies<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.780> introduced<00:01:22.289> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that's how zombies was introduced you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.929 
that's how zombies was introduced you
had<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> complete<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.159> campaign<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> unlock

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
had to complete the campaign to unlock

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
had to complete the campaign to unlock
zombies<00:01:24.359> game<00:01:24.539> mode<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.259> happening

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
zombies game mode and that's happening

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
zombies game mode and that's happening
again<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.789> basically<00:01:27.119> how<00:01:27.329> you<00:01:27.390> get

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
again so basically how you get

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.090 
again so basically how you get
extinction<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.649> have<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> complete

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
extinction is that you have to complete

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
extinction is that you have to complete
the<00:01:29.520> whole<00:01:29.789> story<00:01:30.149> mode<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the whole story mode and then it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
the whole story mode and then it's
unlocked<00:01:31.649> so<00:01:32.219> obviously<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.759> guess<00:01:33.179> they

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
unlocked so obviously i guess they

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.609 
unlocked so obviously i guess they
really<00:01:33.329> did<00:01:33.689> work<00:01:33.869> their<00:01:34.079> ass<00:01:34.200> off<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.469> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
really did work their ass off on this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
really did work their ass off on this
campaign<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.880> people

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
campaign they really want to see people

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
campaign they really want to see people
playing<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.409> i'm<00:01:37.859> not<00:01:38.039> sure<00:01:38.100> maybe<00:01:38.429> at<00:01:38.609> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
playing this so i'm not sure maybe at a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.069 
playing this so i'm not sure maybe at a
later<00:01:38.700> date<00:01:38.939> they'll<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.780> unlocked

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
later date they'll just have it unlocked

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.209 
later date they'll just have it unlocked
i<00:01:40.289> guess<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.799> did<00:01:41.100> with

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
i guess that's what they did with

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.480 
i guess that's what they did with
zombies<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.299> anyway<00:01:42.689> let's<00:01:42.929> move<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.100> i

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
zombies but anyway let's move on so i

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.950 
zombies but anyway let's move on so i
guess<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:44.999> different<00:01:45.390> types<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.689> maps

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
guess there are different types of maps

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.410 
guess there are different types of maps
these<00:01:46.229> maps<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:47.030> apparently<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.210> not

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
these maps are apparently they're not

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.609 
these maps are apparently they're not
just<00:01:48.689> necessarily<00:01:48.929> made<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
just necessarily made for the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.139 
just necessarily made for the
multiplayer<00:01:49.979> they're<00:01:50.189> made<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.939> game

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
multiplayer they're made for this game

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.080 
multiplayer they're made for this game
mode<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.259> aliens<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.310> game<00:01:53.880> mode

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
mode and the aliens in this game mode

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
mode and the aliens in this game mode
this<00:01:54.359> extinction<00:01:54.780> game<00:01:55.109> mode<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.439> not

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this extinction game mode are not

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
this extinction game mode are not
necessarily<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.789> of<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> kind<00:01:57.179> there<00:01:57.359> are

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
necessarily just one of a kind there are

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.819 
necessarily just one of a kind there are
all<00:01:57.539> kinds<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> various<00:01:58.200> types<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.590> some

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
all kinds of various types there's some

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.709 
all kinds of various types there's some
that<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.490> health<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> kill<00:02:00.090> there's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
that take more health to kill there's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.080 
that take more health to kill there's
some<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.409> are<00:02:01.649> run<00:02:01.950> faster<00:02:02.520> there's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
some that are run faster there's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630 
some that are run faster there's
basically<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.079> guess<00:02:04.619> different<00:02:05.310> types

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
basically just I guess different types

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.679 
basically just I guess different types
that<00:02:05.789> have<00:02:05.819> different<00:02:06.030> abilities<00:02:06.359> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that have different abilities and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.700 
that have different abilities and
they're<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.380> two<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.679> three

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
they're not just like two to three

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.560 
they're not just like two to three
different<00:02:08.100> types<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.490> aliens<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.030> multiple

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
different types of aliens is multiple

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.810 
different types of aliens is multiple
and<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.620> guess<00:02:10.770> they<00:02:10.890> call<00:02:11.100> them<00:02:11.250> space<00:02:11.520> bugs

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and I guess they call them space bugs

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.840 
and I guess they call them space bugs
I'm<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.120> sure<00:02:12.300> exactly<00:02:12.720> why<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.320> but<00:02:14.160> I'm

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
I'm not sure exactly why is that but I'm

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.130 
I'm not sure exactly why is that but I'm
a thing<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.330> resemble<00:02:15.780> some<00:02:15.960> type<00:02:16.110> of

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
a thing that they resemble some type of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.660 
a thing that they resemble some type of
bugs<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:16.920> instincts<00:02:17.430> may<00:02:17.610> be

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
bugs then they have instincts may be

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.550 
bugs then they have instincts may be
like<00:02:17.880> bugs<00:02:18.120> maybe<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.780> fly<00:02:18.990> I'm<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.320> exactly

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
like bugs maybe some fly I'm not exactly

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.520 
like bugs maybe some fly I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.130> yet<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:21.390> back<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> load

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
sure of that yet but back to the load

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
sure of that yet but back to the load
out<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.920> said<00:02:23.160> at<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.340> beginning<00:02:23.480> there's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
out that I said at the beginning there's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
out that I said at the beginning there's
a<00:02:24.570> load<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.260> time<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> zombies

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
a load out this time you know it zombies

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.460 
a load out this time you know it zombies
it<00:02:26.700> started<00:02:27.030> off<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.390> handgun<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:28.260> it

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it started off with a handgun that's it

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.020 
it started off with a handgun that's it
you<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.920> ran<00:02:29.160> around<00:02:29.280> start<00:02:29.670> killing

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
you just ran around start killing

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.990 
you just ran around start killing
zombies<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> gaining<00:02:31.560> money<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.010> points<00:02:32.370> but

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
zombies and gaining money and points but

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.610 
zombies and gaining money and points but
you<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> loadout<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> class<00:02:34.380> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
you have a loadout you have a class you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.590 
you have a loadout you have a class you
can<00:02:34.770> be<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> weapon<00:02:35.460> specialist<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.360> says

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
can be a weapon specialist it says

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.180 
can be a weapon specialist it says
actually<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> system<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.010> have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
actually in the system so you can have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
actually in the system so you can have
twenty<00:02:38.460> percent<00:02:38.730> more<00:02:38.970> bullet<00:02:39.240> damage<00:02:39.330> I'm

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
twenty percent more bullet damage I'm

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.000 
twenty percent more bullet damage I'm
sure<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.110> there's<00:02:40.290> all<00:02:40.500> their<00:02:40.650> various

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
sure that there's all their various

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
sure that there's all their various
types<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> pistol<00:02:43.080> not

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
types and then you can have a pistol not

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.110 
types and then you can have a pistol not
exactly<00:02:43.710> sure<00:02:43.830> if<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.310> that's<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
exactly sure if that's the that's the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.550 
exactly sure if that's the that's the
layout<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.600> only<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.960> have<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.110> pistol<00:02:46.530> in

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
layout you only can have a pistol in

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.050 
layout you only can have a pistol in
this<00:02:46.680> game<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.040> i<00:02:47.100> highly<00:02:47.370> doubt<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.760> i'm

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this game but i highly doubt that i'm

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.000 
this game but i highly doubt that i'm
guessing<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.320> rank<00:02:49.590> up<00:02:49.740> there<00:02:49.800> is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
guessing that as you rank up there is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.590 
guessing that as you rank up there is
actually<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> rank<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.760> system<00:02:51.120> i'm<00:02:51.210> sure<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
actually a rank up system i'm sure that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.150 
actually a rank up system i'm sure that
maybe<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.900> unlock<00:02:52.260> other<00:02:52.440> types<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.860> weapons

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
maybe you unlock other types of weapons

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.100 
maybe you unlock other types of weapons
maybe<00:02:53.310> marksman<00:02:53.820> rifles<00:02:54.210> maybe<00:02:54.750> there's<00:02:55.050> a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
maybe marksman rifles maybe there's a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.510 
maybe marksman rifles maybe there's a
type<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.350> wonder<00:02:55.710> weapon<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.100> something<00:02:56.400> of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
type of wonder weapon or something of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.070 
type of wonder weapon or something of
that<00:02:56.550> sort<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:56.940> actually<00:02:57.240> i'll<00:02:57.750> get<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.050> that

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
that sort but actually i'll get to that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740 
that sort but actually i'll get to that
a<00:02:58.200> little<00:02:58.260> bit<00:02:58.440> later<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.970> with<00:03:00.180> pistol<00:03:00.570> type

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
a little bit later but with pistol type

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.180 
a little bit later but with pistol type
that's<00:03:00.960> how<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.140> start<00:03:01.380> off<00:03:01.530> with<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.740> pistol

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that's how you start off with a pistol

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.620 
that's how you start off with a pistol
there's<00:03:02.460> various<00:03:02.820> types<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.150> pistols<00:03:03.510> i'm

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
there's various types of pistols i'm

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.660 
there's various types of pistols i'm
guessing<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.860> level<00:03:05.070> up<00:03:05.310> i'm<00:03:05.460> sure

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
guessing and as you level up i'm sure

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.370 
guessing and as you level up i'm sure
that<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.000> would<00:03:06.210> get<00:03:06.660> other<00:03:06.960> types<00:03:07.230> of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
that you would get other types of

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.860 
that you would get other types of
weapons<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.920> are<00:03:08.160> better<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.880> use<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.480> then

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
weapons that are better to use and then

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.840 
weapons that are better to use and then
there's<00:03:10.050> mo<00:03:10.410> type<00:03:10.680> i'm<00:03:10.800> not<00:03:10.950> exactly<00:03:11.160> sure<00:03:11.340> how

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
there's mo type i'm not exactly sure how

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.430 
there's mo type i'm not exactly sure how
that's<00:03:12.060> going<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.300> work<00:03:12.360> with<00:03:12.630> mo<00:03:12.990> maybe<00:03:13.260> it's

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
that's going to work with mo maybe it's

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800 
that's going to work with mo maybe it's
some<00:03:13.620> type<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.830> like<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:15.300> instance<00:03:15.390> in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
some type of like for instance in

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.570 
some type of like for instance in
zombies<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.350> could<00:03:16.500> level<00:03:16.890> up<00:03:17.010> your<00:03:17.040> weapon

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
zombies you could level up your weapon

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.000 
zombies you could level up your weapon
and<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.300> bullets<00:03:18.690> kind<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:19.080> turned<00:03:19.320> into<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
and in the bullets kind of turned into I

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.770 
and in the bullets kind of turned into I
guess<00:03:20.490> rays<00:03:20.820> or<00:03:21.060> something<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.450> sort

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
guess rays or something of that sort

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.690 
guess rays or something of that sort
kind<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.590> felt<00:03:22.770> like<00:03:22.830> Star<00:03:23.130> Wars<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.460> me<00:03:23.550> I

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
kind of felt like Star Wars to me I

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.300 
kind of felt like Star Wars to me I
don't<00:03:23.910> know<00:03:23.970> why<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:24.750> um<00:03:24.960> I'm<00:03:25.650> not<00:03:25.860> sure<00:03:25.920> I'm

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
don't know why but um I'm not sure I'm

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.380 
don't know why but um I'm not sure I'm
not<00:03:26.460> exactly<00:03:26.670> sure<00:03:26.820> if<00:03:26.910> that's<00:03:27.150> possible

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
not exactly sure if that's possible

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.670 
not exactly sure if that's possible
maybe<00:03:27.840> that's<00:03:28.110> something<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.410> goes<00:03:28.620> with

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
maybe that's something that goes with

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.800 
maybe that's something that goes with
the<00:03:28.920> ranking<00:03:29.250> system<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.820> then<00:03:30.360> there's<00:03:30.540> team

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the ranking system and then there's team

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.970 
the ranking system and then there's team
support<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.410> actually<00:03:31.710> very<00:03:31.740> interesting

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
support that's actually very interesting

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.460 
support that's actually very interesting
so<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:32.550> kind<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.360> wants<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.690> guys<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.900> work<00:03:34.320> as

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
so it kind of wants you guys to work as

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.320 
so it kind of wants you guys to work as
a<00:03:34.500> team<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.190> game<00:03:35.250> mode<00:03:35.580> actually

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
a team in this game mode actually

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.250 
a team in this game mode actually
there's<00:03:36.450> more<00:03:36.600> information<00:03:36.990> on<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.230> a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
there's more information on that a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.510 
there's more information on that a
little<00:03:37.470> bit<00:03:37.620> later<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.130> much<00:03:38.280> information

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
little bit later so much information

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.580 
little bit later so much information
that's<00:03:38.880> come<00:03:39.060> out<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.210> this<00:03:39.330> guy's<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> team

that's come out of this guy's but a team

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.080 
that's come out of this guy's but a team
support<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.010> guessing<00:03:41.340> there's<00:03:41.460> team<00:03:41.790> like

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
support I'm guessing there's team like

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.000 
support I'm guessing there's team like
team<00:03:42.300> mo<00:03:42.720> team<00:03:43.050> armor<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.650> there's<00:03:43.800> team

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
explosives in this instance and then

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.180 
explosives in this instance and then
there's<00:03:45.990> strike<00:03:46.200> packages<00:03:46.710> I'm<00:03:46.860> not<00:03:46.980> exactly

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
there's strike packages I'm not exactly

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.350 
there's strike packages I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.460> there's<00:03:47.640> going<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.910> limitation

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
sure if there's going to be a limitation

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.080 
sure if there's going to be a limitation
on<00:03:48.600> strike<00:03:48.900> packages<00:03:49.350> but<00:03:49.890> there's<00:03:50.100> IMS<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.880> in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
on strike packages but there's IMS is in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.820 
on strike packages but there's IMS is in
this<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.480> obviously<00:03:51.540> that's<00:03:51.900> from<00:03:52.140> mw3<00:03:52.560> if

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
this and obviously that's from mw3 if

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.980 
this and obviously that's from mw3 if
you<00:03:52.890> guys<00:03:53.040> remember<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:54.660> we<00:03:54.840> have

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
you guys remember that and then we have

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.560 
you guys remember that and then we have
the<00:03:55.110> equalizer<00:03:55.590> that's<00:03:55.890> different<00:03:56.330> then<00:03:57.330> this

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
the equalizer that's different then this

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.510 
the equalizer that's different then this
guy<00:03:57.810> has<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.020> portable<00:03:58.590> mini<00:03:58.770> gun<00:03:59.040> turret<00:03:59.370> it's

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
guy has a portable mini gun turret it's

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.100 
guy has a portable mini gun turret it's
a<00:03:59.580> place<00:03:59.790> we'll<00:04:00.000> terp<00:04:00.210> capable<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.930> delivering

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
a place we'll terp capable of delivering

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
a place we'll terp capable of delivering
blistering<00:04:01.950> fire<00:04:02.160> palp<00:04:02.430> not<00:04:02.610> sure<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.000> is

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
blistering fire palp not sure if this is

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.550 
blistering fire palp not sure if this is
going<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.390> be<00:04:03.450> like<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.690> Wonder<00:04:04.050> weapon<00:04:04.170> of

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
going to be like the Wonder weapon of

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.280 
going to be like the Wonder weapon of
this<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.490> game<00:04:05.760> mode<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.600> would<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:06.960> very

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
this a game mode so that would be very

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.230 
this a game mode so that would be very
interesting<00:04:07.890> because<00:04:07.980> I'm<00:04:08.460> not<00:04:08.670> sure<00:04:08.910> exactly

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
interesting because I'm not sure exactly

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.350 
interesting because I'm not sure exactly
if<00:04:09.360> that's<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.320> only<00:04:10.350> equalizer<00:04:11.070> but<00:04:11.490> it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
if that's just the only equalizer but it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.990 
if that's just the only equalizer but it
does<00:04:12.810> look<00:04:12.840> very<00:04:13.050> interesting<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.000> we'll

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
does look very interesting and we'll

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.370 
does look very interesting and we'll
have<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.270> look<00:04:15.390> out<00:04:15.540> for<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.260> if

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
have to look out for that and see if

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.870 
have to look out for that and see if
there's<00:04:16.590> all<00:04:16.859> kinds<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.250> different<00:04:17.580> types<00:04:17.700> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
there's all kinds of different types of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.710 
there's all kinds of different types of
equalizers<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.810> use<00:04:19.049> but<00:04:20.040> let's<00:04:20.340> move<00:04:20.520> down<00:04:20.820> we

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
equalizers to use but let's move down we

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.020 
equalizers to use but let's move down we
have<00:04:21.870> some<00:04:22.620> type<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.800> national<00:04:23.400> forest<00:04:23.790> map

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
least you're going to have to get a

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.430 
least you're going to have to get a
drill<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.300> you're<00:04:34.810> going<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:34.990> have<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.170> go

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
drill and you're going to have to go

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.350 
drill and you're going to have to go
around<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.950> find<00:04:36.190> hives<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.820> destroy<00:04:37.180> them

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
around and find hives and destroy them

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.810 
around and find hives and destroy them
and<00:04:37.390> your<00:04:37.630> drill<00:04:37.930> has<00:04:38.140> has<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.830> health<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.580> i

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
and your drill has has a health it i

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.220 
and your drill has has a health it i
think<00:04:39.910> it's<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.330> out<00:04:40.450> of<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.630> 100<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.140> these

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
think it's like out of a 100 and these

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.930 
think it's like out of a 100 and these
aliens<00:04:41.680> are<00:04:41.740> going<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:41.950> try<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.160> destroy<00:04:42.730> this

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
aliens are going to try to destroy this

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.330 
aliens are going to try to destroy this
drill<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.480> what<00:04:44.110> your<00:04:44.260> main<00:04:44.470> objective<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:45.040> to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
drill and what your main objective is to

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.160 
drill and what your main objective is to
protect<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:45.970> drill<00:04:46.210> while<00:04:46.420> destroys<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
protect this drill while destroys the

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.830 
protect this drill while destroys the
hive<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.650> then<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.460> guess<00:04:48.670> you<00:04:49.210> go<00:04:49.360> high<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
hive and then I guess you go high of the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.900 
hive and then I guess you go high of the
hive<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.230> hive<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.800> then<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.400> guess<00:04:51.610> that's<00:04:51.790> how

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
hive to hive and then I guess that's how

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.730 
hive to hive and then I guess that's how
you<00:04:51.970> complete<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.570> round<00:04:52.780> or<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.170> wave<00:04:53.410> and

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
you complete the round or the wave and

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.310 
you complete the round or the wave and
then<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.310> move<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.960> then<00:04:56.050> we're<00:04:56.170> going<00:04:56.260> to

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
then you move on and then we're going to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.560 
then you move on and then we're going to
move<00:04:56.380> down<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.920> little<00:04:57.160> bit<00:04:57.310> more<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:57.940> then<00:04:58.450> we

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
move down a little bit more and then we

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.510 
move down a little bit more and then we
obviously<00:04:58.750> if<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.440> guys<00:04:59.620> we<00:05:00.040> have<00:05:00.190> like<00:05:00.400> the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
obviously if you guys we have like the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.550 
obviously if you guys we have like the
little<00:05:00.730> loadout<00:05:01.060> screen<00:05:01.570> i<00:05:01.600> guess<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.440> can

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
little loadout screen i guess you can

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.380 
little loadout screen i guess you can
use<00:05:02.740> your<00:05:02.860> d-pad<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.940> that's<00:05:04.210> how<00:05:04.330> you

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
use your d-pad and that that's how you

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.960 
use your d-pad and that that's how you
can<00:05:04.570> unlock<00:05:04.720> or<00:05:05.230> use<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.070> certain<00:05:06.640> load<00:05:06.820> out

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
can unlock or use the certain load out

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.770 
can unlock or use the certain load out
or<00:05:07.290> activate<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:08.440> at<00:05:08.620> least<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:09.780> there's

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
or activate it at least and there's

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.120 
or activate it at least and there's
challenges<00:05:11.050> that's<00:05:11.710> i<00:05:11.830> haven't<00:05:12.100> mentioned

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
challenges that's i haven't mentioned

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.010 
challenges that's i haven't mentioned
that<00:05:12.520> yet<00:05:12.820> there's<00:05:13.090> challenges<00:05:13.360> like<00:05:13.720> i<00:05:13.870> guess

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
that yet there's challenges like i guess

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.780 
that yet there's challenges like i guess
i'm<00:05:14.230> not<00:05:14.410> sure<00:05:14.530> if<00:05:14.590> they<00:05:14.680> come<00:05:14.830> up<00:05:14.950> at<00:05:15.160> various

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
i'm not sure if they come up at various

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.000 
i'm not sure if they come up at various
times<00:05:16.120> but<00:05:16.450> these<00:05:16.930> challenges<00:05:17.470> will<00:05:17.680> look

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
times but these challenges will look

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.530 
times but these challenges will look
require<00:05:18.400> you<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.700> do<00:05:18.820> stuff<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.270> can<00:05:19.420> earn

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
require you to do stuff and you can earn

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.140 
require you to do stuff and you can earn
money<00:05:19.870> from<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.290> and<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:21.460> challenge<00:05:21.730> says

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
money from it and this challenge says

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.420 
money from it and this challenge says
kill<00:05:22.510> 15<00:05:22.900> aliens<00:05:23.290> using<00:05:23.590> pistols<00:05:23.980> before<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
kill 15 aliens using pistols before the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.910 
kill 15 aliens using pistols before the
hive<00:05:24.640> is<00:05:24.850> destroyed<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:26.410> guess<00:05:26.560> like<00:05:26.890> I

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
hive is destroyed and I guess like I

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.380 
hive is destroyed and I guess like I
said<00:05:27.040> before<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.430> get<00:05:27.580> money<00:05:27.820> from<00:05:27.970> this<00:05:28.150> and

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
said before you get money from this and

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.180 
said before you get money from this and
I'm<00:05:28.540> guessing<00:05:28.720> this<00:05:29.020> money<00:05:29.350> can<00:05:29.620> be<00:05:29.770> used<00:05:29.800> to

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
I'm guessing this money can be used to

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.370 
I'm guessing this money can be used to
unlock<00:05:30.460> weapons<00:05:30.910> or<00:05:31.600> other<00:05:31.810> means<00:05:32.110> of

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
unlock weapons or other means of

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.080 
unlock weapons or other means of
upgrades<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.390> I<00:05:34.570> just<00:05:34.810> I<00:05:35.080> did<00:05:35.320> just<00:05:35.350> say

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
upgrades so and I just I did just say

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.940 
upgrades so and I just I did just say
upgrades<00:05:37.090> because<00:05:37.570> there<00:05:37.930> are<00:05:38.170> upgrades<00:05:38.800> in

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
upgrades because there are upgrades in

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.200 
upgrades because there are upgrades in
this<00:05:39.070> after<00:05:39.490> I'm<00:05:39.610> not<00:05:39.760> sure<00:05:39.970> if<00:05:40.060> this<00:05:40.150> is

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
this after I'm not sure if this is

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.300 
this after I'm not sure if this is
coming<00:05:40.660> after<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.230> complete<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.800> round<00:05:41.980> I'm

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
coming after you complete the round I'm

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.790 
coming after you complete the round I'm
guessing<00:05:43.000> it<00:05:43.090> is<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.780> have<00:05:43.930> skill<00:05:44.260> points<00:05:44.620> and

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
guessing it is you have skill points and

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.140 
guessing it is you have skill points and
these<00:05:44.860> skill<00:05:45.100> points<00:05:45.400> can<00:05:45.550> go<00:05:45.669> towards<00:05:46.030> I

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
these skill points can go towards I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.150 
these skill points can go towards I
guess<00:05:46.360> one<00:05:46.540> of<00:05:46.570> your<00:05:46.720> loadouts<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:47.980> if

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
guess one of your loadouts and like if

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.860 
guess one of your loadouts and like if
you<00:05:48.250> want<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:48.490> use<00:05:48.580> it<00:05:48.610> for<00:05:48.730> team<00:05:49.030> support<00:05:49.510> or

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
you want to use it for team support or

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.900 
you want to use it for team support or
maybe<00:05:50.080> just<00:05:50.169> your<00:05:50.560> weapon<00:05:50.950> or<00:05:51.040> something<00:05:51.400> like

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
maybe just your weapon or something like

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.460 
maybe just your weapon or something like
that<00:05:51.970> I'm<00:05:52.540> guessing<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:52.990> really<00:05:53.320> can<00:05:53.440> help

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
that I'm guessing that really can help

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.870 
that I'm guessing that really can help
like<00:05:53.800> in<00:05:53.950> this<00:05:54.100> instance<00:05:54.490> this<00:05:54.640> guy<00:05:54.820> is

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
like in this instance this guy is

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.720 
like in this instance this guy is
leveling<00:05:55.360> up<00:05:55.570> his<00:05:55.890> MO<00:05:56.890> I<00:05:56.919> think<00:05:57.220> it's<00:05:57.340> as<00:05:57.460> mo

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
leveling up his MO I think it's as mo

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.790 
leveling up his MO I think it's as mo
and<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.330> guess<00:05:58.510> this<00:05:58.750> side<00:05:59.020> says<00:05:59.320> you<00:05:59.440> can<00:05:59.560> swap

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
and I guess this side says you can swap

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.100 
and I guess this side says you can swap
up<00:05:59.950> and<00:06:00.100> faster<00:06:00.460> move<00:06:00.700> faster<00:06:01.240> while<00:06:01.419> 80s<00:06:01.810> and

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
up and faster move faster while 80s and

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.510 
up and faster move faster while 80s and
fast<00:06:02.680> hand<00:06:03.040> off<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.790> use<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:05.280> like<00:06:06.280> I<00:06:06.310> said

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
fast hand off and use and like I said

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.040 
fast hand off and use and like I said
and<00:06:06.790> then<00:06:06.880> at<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.090> end<00:06:07.180> of<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.419> round<00:06:07.600> it<00:06:07.900> just

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
and then at the end of the round it just

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.480 
and then at the end of the round it just
shows<00:06:08.230> how<00:06:08.260> much<00:06:08.530> money<00:06:08.770> you<00:06:08.830> earn<00:06:08.980> from<00:06:09.190> drill

shows how much money you earn from drill
