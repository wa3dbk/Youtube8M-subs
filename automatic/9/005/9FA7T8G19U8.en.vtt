you have a device it looks like a like a

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:12.080 
you have a device it looks like a like a
key<00:00:03.240> almost<00:00:08.660> okay<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:09.809> see<00:00:10.880> okay<00:00:11.880> what<00:00:12.030> does

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
key almost okay we see okay what does

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.970 
key almost okay we see okay what does
that<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.590> put<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> baby's<00:00:14.849> jaw

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
that so you can put this on a baby's jaw

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.279 
that so you can put this on a baby's jaw
and<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.369> make<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> job<00:00:20.970> grow<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.660> millimeter

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and it can make a job grow a millimeter

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.170 
and it can make a job grow a millimeter
a<00:00:22.380> day<00:00:23.060> or<00:00:24.060> within<00:00:24.840> ten<00:00:25.410> within<00:00:26.160> seven<00:00:27.060> or

a day or within ten within seven or
eight<00:00:27.269> days<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.560> make<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> baby's<00:00:29.250> jaw<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
eight days you can make a baby's jaw a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
eight days you can make a baby's jaw a
normal<00:00:30.689> size<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:32.660> avoid<00:00:33.660> either<00:00:34.110> doing<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
normal size and avoid either doing a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
normal size and avoid either doing a
tracheostomy<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> baby<00:00:35.820> whether<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
hole in the throat right turning into

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
hole in the throat right turning into
something<00:00:38.520> yeah<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.540> turn<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
something yeah you just turn this and it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.260 
something yeah you just turn this and it
just<00:00:41.219> grows<00:00:41.430> into<00:00:41.760> effect<00:00:43.879> once<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
just grows into effect once you use that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.740 
just grows into effect once you use that
device<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.430> bone<00:00:47.789> keep<00:00:48.210> growing<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
device will that bone keep growing the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.959 
device will that bone keep growing the
bone<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.350> grow<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> row<00:00:50.579> normal

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
bone will just grow and in a row normal

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
bone will just grow and in a row normal
after<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.840> sort<00:00:52.110> rather<00:00:52.739> minor

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
after that so if sort rather minor

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.160 
after that so if sort rather minor
procedure<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.510> maximum<00:00:54.750> results

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
procedure you get maximum results

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889 
procedure you get maximum results
maximum<00:00:56.010> results<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> rare

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
maximum results in it's in the rare

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.130 
maximum results in it's in the rare
instances<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> lot
