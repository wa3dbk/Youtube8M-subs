00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a thirty pound difference which really

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.000 
a thirty pound difference which really
bugs<00:00:27.779> me<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.260> still<00:00:28.500> can't<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
bugs me because I still can't see the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
bugs me because I still can't see the
difference<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> photos<00:00:29.939> which<00:00:30.269> mean

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
difference of the photos which mean

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.820 
difference of the photos which mean
obviously<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.410> clothes<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.710> fitting

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
obviously my clothes are fitting

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
obviously my clothes are fitting
different<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.510> big<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
different but it's just not that big of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.319 
different but it's just not that big of
a<00:00:33.870> difference<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.410> wanted<00:00:35.149> because<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
a difference that I wanted because I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
a difference that I wanted because I
still<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> point<00:00:37.410> even<00:00:37.590> where<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
be a my scale I know a little bit of it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
be a my scale I know a little bit of it
like<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> doc<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.690> people<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:52.020> not

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
like it doc I know that people say not

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
like it doc I know that people say not
to<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.379> off<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> BMI<00:00:52.860> scale<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.370> it's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
to go off the BMI scale because it's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
to go off the BMI scale because it's
wrong<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> doctor<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
wrong and you go to the doctor but it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.250 
wrong and you go to the doctor but it's
for<00:00:55.680> me<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.850> visual<00:00:57.260> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
for me is just a really good visual and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
for me is just a really good visual and
I<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.949> fairly<00:00:59.399> accurate<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.090> mean<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I do think it's fairly accurate I mean I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.639 
I do think it's fairly accurate I mean I
know<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.600> proportions<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> things<00:01:01.500> like

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
know there's proportions and things like

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.939 
know there's proportions and things like
that<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.760> tell<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.239> body<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.260> saw<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that but I can tell my body that I saw a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.429 
that but I can tell my body that I saw a
lot<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.189> extra<00:01:05.519> weight<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.200> scales
