you want to start at the ESP program and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.250 
you want to start at the ESP program and
furthermore<00:00:15.880> we<00:00:16.660> have<00:00:16.810> an<00:00:16.930> international

furthermore we have an international
program<00:00:17.650> at<00:00:18.010> more<00:00:18.250> than<00:00:18.280> 40<00:00:19.000> nationalities<00:00:19.630> so

international<00:00:22.780> environment<00:00:23.020> I<00:00:23.470> think<00:00:23.890> it's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
international environment I think it's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.880 
international environment I think it's
important<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:25.360> be<00:00:25.539> a<00:00:25.570> very<00:00:25.810> open<00:00:26.020> person<00:00:26.200> if

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
important to be a very open person if

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
you want to be in the ESP program first

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.850 
you want to be in the ESP program first
of<00:00:28.930> all<00:00:29.080> because<00:00:29.289> there<00:00:29.590> are<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.680> lot<00:00:29.830> of

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
of all because there are a lot of

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.260

students<00:01:09.219> at<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.549> ESP<00:01:10.299> must<00:01:10.750> be<00:01:11.020> very

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
students at the ESP must be very

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.289 
students at the ESP must be very
proactive<00:01:11.469> students<00:01:12.250> they<00:01:12.399> must<00:01:12.670> know<00:01:13.000> how<00:01:13.240> to

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
proactive students they must know how to

proactive students they must know how to
plan<00:01:13.600> ahead<00:01:13.780> because<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.500> program<00:01:14.829> is<00:01:14.920> very

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
plan ahead because the program is very

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.639 
plan ahead because the program is very
demanding<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:16.119> helps<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:16.539> they<00:01:16.719> know<00:01:17.020> what

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
demanding it helps if they know what

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.649

they like and enjoy about physiotherapy

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.289 
they like and enjoy about physiotherapy
or<00:01:20.229> what<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.439> want<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.950> explore<00:01:21.399> further<00:01:21.729> which

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
or what I want to explore further which

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.990 
or what I want to explore further which
direction<00:01:22.689> self-reflection<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:24.520> something

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
direction self-reflection is something

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.389 
direction self-reflection is something
that<00:01:25.119> they<00:01:25.299> ask<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.899> lot<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:26.109> us<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:27.159> this

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
that they ask a lot of us in this

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.249 
that they ask a lot of us in this
program<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.689> being<00:01:29.259> able<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.759> self-reflect

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
program so being able to self-reflect

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.080 
program so being able to self-reflect
take<00:01:32.259> feedback<00:01:32.560> give<00:01:33.100> feedback<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.789> a<00:01:33.820> pretty

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
take feedback give feedback is a pretty

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.060 
take feedback give feedback is a pretty
important<00:01:34.659> quality<00:01:35.079> I<00:01:35.109> think<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.619> be<00:01:35.740> able<00:01:35.770> to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
important quality I think to be able to

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.669 
important quality I think to be able to
succeed<00:01:36.549> in<00:01:36.789> this<00:01:37.060> program<00:01:37.679> resourcefulness

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
succeed in this program resourcefulness

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.270 
succeed in this program resourcefulness
because<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:40.030> really<00:01:40.329> do<00:01:40.509> have<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:40.719> depend

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
because you really do have to depend

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.739 
because you really do have to depend
sometimes<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.429> yourself<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.000> be<00:01:43.149> able<00:01:43.329> to<00:01:43.570> get

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
sometimes on yourself to be able to get

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.139 
sometimes on yourself to be able to get
the<00:01:44.409> answers<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.799> you're<00:01:45.070> looking<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.460> the

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
the answers that you're looking for the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.669 
the answers that you're looking for the
teachers<00:01:46.509> will<00:01:46.719> always<00:01:47.049> give<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.289> guidance

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
teachers will always give you guidance

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.160 
teachers will always give you guidance
but<00:01:48.340> they<00:01:48.490> do<00:01:48.549> leave<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:48.939> lot<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.359> the<00:01:49.539> tasks<00:01:50.020> up

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
but they do leave a lot of the tasks up

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.399 
but they do leave a lot of the tasks up
to<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:50.859> I<00:01:51.399> think<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.659> build<00:01:53.020> our

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
to you and I think it is to build our

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.770 
to you and I think it is to build our
resourcefulness<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.399> make<00:01:54.609> us<00:01:54.780> independent

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
resourcefulness and make us independent
