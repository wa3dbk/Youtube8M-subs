00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.270 
Jewelry storage unit as well but I've
chosen<00:02:20.389> to<00:02:20.810> mount<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.440> wall<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.130> it's

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
chosen to mount it on the wall so it's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.039 
chosen to mount it on the wall so it's
sort<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.519> when<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.329> look<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.780> it

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
sort of when you just look at it it

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.270 
sort of when you just look at it it
looks<00:02:24.079> just<00:02:24.590> like

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
looks just like

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.960 
looks just like
a<00:02:25.569> wall-mounted<00:02:26.569> mirror<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.160> basically

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
a wall-mounted mirror this is basically

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.510 
a wall-mounted mirror this is basically
what<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.360> looks<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.110> with<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.250> cabinet<00:02:31.940> open

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
what it looks like with the cabinet open

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.160 
what it looks like with the cabinet open
so<00:02:34.520> now<00:02:34.670> let's<00:02:34.880> take<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.090> closer<00:02:35.450> look<00:02:35.630> at<00:02:36.020> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170
