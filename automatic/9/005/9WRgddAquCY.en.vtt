00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 put a button in the beginning why we march 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.920
 this is mainstream and I decided to put up with it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.719
 Well, hike my computer in the course of what 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 he will shit bricks and therefore 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.500
 buggy with frapsom but here's another 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.989
 message without turning me off when i'm 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 bad money is saved depot same sense 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 why do it all started to play 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 inspiring music as you say 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.110
 what you have here is long and tedious and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.000
 fight hard here call me 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.920

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.840
 computer with fraps better i will take 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.120
 light that the middle he really shit 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.609
 bricks and then begins to tell us about 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.710
 that was in those parts that floor 1 in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.689
 second i never have details 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 just wondering why every time everything 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.770
 repeats then maybe changed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 some circumstances but the game itself she 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.939
 how was the same type just the only 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.759
 guilt man who played this game clean 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.009
 For the script, these bricks that I quickly 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.479
 for those two days of play, too, because of the script 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.180
 well I ask 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.979
 will there be any script worthy of me 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.390
 not an ardent fan of this game but this game 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
 gave me the opportunity to watch movies 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 play at the same time and when the script 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.520
 repeated he becomes like a court 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.860
 on mondo well no guys you are not mistaken i 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.350
 stuck in this black monitor probably 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 30 seconds but I have immunity 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.210
 further loading awaits us and what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.970
 damn on so long goes guys i'm not 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.640
 I understand the campaign has become fashionable already 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.070
 before entering the game old man in her new 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.610
 when we boot to put some mobile 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.620
 and thank god we booted 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.350
 hike is Siberia so I think 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.570
 the Americans so supposed and dude where 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.360
 bears where are the balalaika and when i see 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.610
 scenes like the movie before the game 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.979
 kill the wall hunt and now in style 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.980
 Luntik put on come out the next word 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:24.260
 well, or something like that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:26.270
 master and since i realized that this game 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.130
 pretty choirs I thought out different 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.380
 scripts for the game what was to play 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.450
 fun though in a little bit the same in 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.080
 folder here, or a typical pattern 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.480
 With my shit life friends smoked booze 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.520
 playing cards and then it seemed to them 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.570
 that they came to the store a little he was told 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.770
 that no vodka he calls his friends whiskey 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:52.670
 253 rubles to buy hear me jimmy 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.190
 thank god you found up found but i 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.950
 got lost a little in the forest dudes i'm not 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.080
 know follow my google hit follow 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.870
 can't tell you anymore man 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.580
 come to the light you hear me you must 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.769
 go to the light or we have already nicknames we 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.130
 we die 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.760
 fucking I sent out characters because he 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.980
 all the same 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.440
 give me a degree under Russian winter 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.260
 get used to and now begins by 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.480
 interesting part of this game is well gameplay 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.519
 given a dream this brick is as if stupid 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.830
 she all sounded like it but really brick 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.690
 This is the main theme of this game and now 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.180
 we have the joy of watching how some 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.549
 dude blue goes home well since we 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.010
 all the time you have to go straight get lost not 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.110
 it will be difficult yamato to that place when 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.780
 still got to there and getting to 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.580
 at home we observe in our friends and here in 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.560
 this is the time my computer and began to shit 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.350
 bricks and you hear it now 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.140
 yes here it began 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.150
 still during his home run and here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.100
 then it started 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.140
 my computer svetki answer in this all 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.390
 hear seriously speaking the first time in life 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.060
 I hear the computer shit bricks 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.489
 Still, I will say a few words about management 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.709
 everything is as it used to be 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.810
 there is absolutely no drum left 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.550
 they will call me a fan of the dead space but 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.470
 the graphics absolutely not pleased me 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.720
 straight in the second part is about the same 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.459
 graphics damn it I generally guess 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.260
 the fact that nothing has changed here except 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.079
 like adding some new ones is possible 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.329
 cards some new mobs my pee 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.549
 exactly the same as in the first 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.200
 the second that's what started for me 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.690
 starts to piss off the stairs and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.639
 all sorts of rise and when the hero is just 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.950
 just looking at one point you can not see 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.660
 what happens to this one and it's real 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.880
 furious feeling that he has 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.889
 SLR more after all he found 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.139
 zagashnik friends and decided with this tan 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.850
 nobody comes well here begins action 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.620
 Well, in principle, now there will be such a moment 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.540
 when i partially remembered myself when 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.610
 I played in the first part of the house you Dacha 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.120
 scorching 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.860
 Yes, it was a matter of fairness. I expected tigers 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.639
 much more than she presented 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.320
 me today 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.060
 well at least i will believe 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.220
 Tomorrow what they give me 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.139
 something new something more successfully done 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.400
 sometimes there are really stupid moments 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.560
 Kamikaze. 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.180
 ayzek could have been here again right 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.010
 run away while he's weight on this fucking 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.650
 car but this is nonsense 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.780
 ends he flashes a beacon through 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.970
 a wall like tps nickname che for garbage 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.960
 and why he did not throw back 500 meters 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.180
 after the explosion 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.669
 here I liked a woman not like 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.919
 woman, in principle, as a woman , too, nothing 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.900
 since i know gps corpse is always 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.850
 was fun so i'm tail now and 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.010
 I wanted to kick a woman and what do you think 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.639
 what the developers have prepared for me 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.770
 act 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.450
 just wanna let someone in not always 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.120
 fun fun to watch here I 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.850
 took aim and the developers showed me 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.590
 dick i can't understand why so i 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.389
 tried to shoot other places i can't 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.210
 I ca n't walk through it 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.700
 make it one with this world 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.430
 ok poher on a woman let heaven be her 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.650
 kitchen if you have sound you can 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.740
 always go play football with him 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.960
 pliable field there is a gate there is nothing 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.250
 football is shorter, that's all i wanted 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.620
 say on this game 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.560
 My opinion is that it does not get 4 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.690
 from 5 and 4 with a minus very same 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.430
 no one argues that the game is good but 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.380
 when you play all parts of it all 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.150
 additions to these parts and when you see 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.780
 damn it starts the same thing 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.580
 bother 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.620
 and draw this fictional game 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.240
 script and some to the price which 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.680
 last almost half of this game 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.389
 if you have never played can 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.310
 try it because you haven't seen two 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.520
 parts and it will seem less 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.660
