hello my name is Tully and today I like
to<00:00:10.970> start<00:00:11.240> off<00:00:11.360> with<00:00:11.480> a<00:00:11.510> fact<00:00:11.809> about<00:00:11.990> batteries

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
to start off with a fact about batteries

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.490 
to start off with a fact about batteries
the<00:00:13.220> fact<00:00:13.250> is<00:00:13.750> they<00:00:14.750> all<00:00:14.870> run<00:00:15.080> out<00:00:15.200> of<00:00:15.290> power

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
the fact is they all run out of power

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.770 
the fact is they all run out of power
eventually<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.760> this<00:00:17.000> can<00:00:17.300> be<00:00:17.450> a<00:00:17.480> problem

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
eventually and this can be a problem

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.890 
eventually and this can be a problem
when<00:00:18.170> there's<00:00:18.350> no<00:00:18.500> power<00:00:18.770> outlet<00:00:19.160> available

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
now with traditional power packs you can

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.750 
now with traditional power packs you can
charge<00:00:23.390> one<00:00:23.660> or<00:00:23.840> two<00:00:23.990> devices<00:00:24.320> simultaneously

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
charge one or two devices simultaneously

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.849
