be able to slice the water a little bit

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.200 
be able to slice the water a little bit
better<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.890> issue<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> once<00:01:42.090> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
hands at the angle right there so I'm

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.730 
hands at the angle right there so I'm
pushing<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.299> water<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.049> what's

so when you're doing that you're kind of

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.010 
so when you're doing that you're kind of
sneaking<00:02:02.909> through<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.329> water<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.750> little<00:02:03.869> bit

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
sneaking through the water a little bit

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.480 
sneaking through the water a little bit
you're<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.130> way

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
doing that to some extent even when

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.359 
doing that to some extent even when
you're<00:02:09.030> you're

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
pulling correctly which I'm gonna show

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.530 
pulling correctly which I'm gonna show
you<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.409> a<00:02:11.530> second<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.670> you're<00:02:13.269> gonna<00:02:13.360> be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
you in a second but you're gonna be

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.030 
you in a second but you're gonna be
sneaking<00:02:13.870> sneaking<00:02:14.530> through<00:02:14.830> you're<00:02:14.980> gonna

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
sneaking sneaking through you're gonna

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.949 
sneaking sneaking through you're gonna
be<00:02:15.159> losing<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.790> little<00:02:16.000> bit<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.299> speed<00:02:16.540> doing

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
be losing a little bit of speed doing

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.110 
be losing a little bit of speed doing
that<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.950> same<00:02:18.159> is<00:02:18.310> true<00:02:18.340> if<00:02:18.610> you're<00:02:18.730> coming

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
that the same is true if you're coming

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.420 
that the same is true if you're coming
in<00:02:19.299> slightly<00:02:19.840> slightly<00:02:20.560> more<00:02:20.920> at<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> pinkie

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
in slightly slightly more at the pinkie

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.670 
in slightly slightly more at the pinkie
it's<00:02:21.849> in<00:02:22.450> my<00:02:22.569> opinion<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.290> easier

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's in my opinion it's a little easier

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.410 
it's in my opinion it's a little easier
on<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.890> shoulder<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.819> do<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.239> like<00:02:25.390> that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
on the shoulder to do it like that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.780 
on the shoulder to do it like that
versus<00:02:25.959> going<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:26.739> again<00:02:26.920> when<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
versus going that but again when you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.890 
versus going that but again when you
start<00:02:28.060> pulling<00:02:28.269> through<00:02:28.629> you're<00:02:28.810> gonna

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
start pulling through you're gonna

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.690 
start pulling through you're gonna
you're<00:02:29.440> gonna<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.829> hands<00:02:30.040> gonna<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.400> at<00:02:30.519> that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
you're gonna your hands gonna be at that

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.940 
you're gonna your hands gonna be at that
that<00:02:31.060> kind<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.569> weird<00:02:31.810> tilt<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.829> you're

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
that kind of a weird tilt and so you're

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.649 
that kind of a weird tilt and so you're
gonna<00:02:33.069> be<00:02:33.280> pushed<00:02:33.549> in<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.700> water<00:02:33.909> this<00:02:34.090> way<00:02:34.329> so

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
gonna be pushed in the water this way so

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.039 
gonna be pushed in the water this way so
again<00:02:35.019> it's<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:36.120> gonna<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.329> totally

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
again it's not gonna be totally

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.740 
again it's not gonna be totally
effective<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.829> getting<00:02:39.129> you<00:02:39.250> swimmin<00:02:40.060> as

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
effective and getting you swimmin as

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.410 
effective and getting you swimmin as
straight<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.319> can<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:42.069> what<00:02:42.879> I<00:02:42.910> suggest

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
coming in with the thumb it comes

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.229 
coming in with the thumb it comes
straight<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.769> like<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.790> pull<00:02:58.090> on

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
straight in like so and then pull on

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.930 
straight in like so and then pull on
through<00:02:58.629> you're<00:02:59.290> gonna<00:02:59.409> set<00:02:59.920> yourself<00:03:00.069> up<00:03:00.730> to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
through you're gonna set yourself up to

pull yourself more straight through the
water<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.780> makes<00:03:05.349> sense<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:07.109> that's<00:03:08.109> way

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
water if that makes sense so that's way

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.080 
water if that makes sense so that's way
to<00:03:08.409> say<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.220> really<00:03:09.489> entering<00:03:09.879> that

coming in it's all one that analogies
that<00:03:14.590> use<00:03:14.950> as<00:03:15.130> if<00:03:16.120> your<00:03:16.450> hand<00:03:16.720> just<00:03:16.810> gonna<00:03:16.989> go

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
that use as if your hand just gonna go

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.920 
that use as if your hand just gonna go

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
front door so it's straight through just

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.270 
front door so it's straight through just
like<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.169> then<00:03:23.560> you're<00:03:23.680> gonna<00:03:23.799> pull

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
right on through that should be the way

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.190 
right on through that should be the way
you<00:03:27.579> want<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:27.879> do<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.239> again<00:03:28.299> keep<00:03:28.870> keep
