and I'm sorry I really can't read the
brand's<00:04:02.730> office<00:04:03.150> oh<00:04:03.300> this<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.630> Koji<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.470> the

brand's office oh this is Koji and the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.200 
brand's office oh this is Koji and the
so<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.060> looks<00:04:06.240> like<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:07.520> I<00:04:08.520> guess<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.180> the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
so it looks like and I guess this is the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.960 
so it looks like and I guess this is the
mascara<00:04:09.720> chrome<00:04:09.990> right<00:04:10.230> here<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:14.730> other

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
mascara chrome right here and this other

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.080 
mascara chrome right here and this other
end<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.690> like<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.410> protector<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.459> your

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
end is like a protector on your

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.820 
end is like a protector on your
under-eye<00:04:18.390> when<00:04:18.900> you're<00:04:19.050> putting<00:04:19.260> makeup<00:04:19.530> i

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
under-eye when you're putting makeup i

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.660 
under-eye when you're putting makeup i
guess<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.910> folds<00:04:21.239> as<00:04:21.510> well<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:22.049> way<00:04:22.670> so

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
guess and it folds as well this way so

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.250
