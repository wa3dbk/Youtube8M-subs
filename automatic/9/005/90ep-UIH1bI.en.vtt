00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
ravine to explore the cakes further but

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.220 
ravine to explore the cakes further but
there's<00:00:22.380> damn<00:00:22.710> lava<00:00:23.009> pool<00:00:23.339> in<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.519> way<00:00:24.230> yeah

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
there's damn lava pool in your way yeah

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.939 
there's damn lava pool in your way yeah
that<00:00:25.499> is<00:00:25.650> really<00:00:25.859> annoying<00:00:26.279> isn't<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> what

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that is really annoying isn't it so what

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.560 
that is really annoying isn't it so what
I<00:00:29.160> usually<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.689> survival<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.650> I'm<00:00:31.829> Cavin<00:00:32.310> I

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
I usually do in survival if I'm Cavin I

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.210 
I usually do in survival if I'm Cavin I
go<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.810> up<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> top<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.010> water

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
go right up to the top of the water

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.920 
go right up to the top of the water
stream<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:35.910> next<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> because<00:00:36.690> if

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
stream right next to it because if

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.100 
stream right next to it because if
there's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> ravine<00:00:37.830> with<00:00:40.640> with<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:42.110> lava

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
there's a ravine with with some lava

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.490 
there's a ravine with with some lava
there<00:00:43.650> probably<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.790> water<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.270> well<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.720> just

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
there probably is water as well I just

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
there probably is water as well I just
make<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.740> little<00:00:46.950> bridge<00:00:47.310> like<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:50.240> they<00:00:51.240> can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
make a little bridge like this they can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.380 
make a little bridge like this they can
see<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.750> flowing<00:00:52.260> already<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.120> last

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
see it flowing already that was the last

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.020 
see it flowing already that was the last
one<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.400> down<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.300> water

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.219 

place<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> block<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.479> go<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.020> again

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
place a block there and go up one again

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.630 
place a block there and go up one again
and<00:01:07.880> then<00:01:08.880> oh<00:01:09.350> not<00:01:10.350> fall<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.310> repeat

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and then oh not fall off and then repeat

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.539 
and then oh not fall off and then repeat
the<00:01:11.790> same<00:01:12.000> process<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> we'll

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the same process over and over so we'll

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:41.600 
the same process over and over so we'll
be<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.299> done

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.370 

there<00:01:42.610> we<00:01:42.760> go<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.270> think<00:01:43.720> I've<00:01:43.870> reached<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
there we go so I think I've reached the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.030 
there we go so I think I've reached the
point<00:01:44.620> where<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.550> can<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:47.530> ahead<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.680> climb

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
point where I can go ahead and climb

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.370 
point where I can go ahead and climb
back<00:01:48.280> up<00:01:48.490> through<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.030> fall<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.230> water

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
back up through the fall in the water

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.810 
back up through the fall in the water
and<00:01:51.300> see<00:01:52.300> what<00:01:52.480> this<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.660> called<00:01:53.080> now<00:01:53.680> as<00:01:54.130> you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
and see what this is called now as you

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
and see what this is called now as you
can<00:01:54.970> see<00:01:55.180> there<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.480> quite<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:56.170> large<00:01:56.560> area<00:01:57.250> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
can see there is quite a large area of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.610 
can see there is quite a large area of
ravine<00:01:58.840> or<00:01:59.140> lava<00:01:59.530> already<00:02:00.100> covered<00:02:00.520> by<00:02:00.700> water

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
ravine or lava already covered by water

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.500 
ravine or lava already covered by water
and<00:02:02.620> this<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:03.040> also<00:02:03.220> quite<00:02:03.520> easy<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.970> clean<00:02:04.330> up

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
and this is also quite easy to clean up

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.280 
and this is also quite easy to clean up
since<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.380> come<00:02:06.040> on<00:02:06.130> as<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:07.540> consists<00:02:08.170> of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
since it come on as it just consists of

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.250 
since it come on as it just consists of
one<00:02:08.800> source<00:02:09.430> block<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.750> let's<00:02:10.930> just<00:02:11.080> continue

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
one source block so let's just continue

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.490 
one source block so let's just continue
a<00:02:11.500> little<00:02:11.770> bit<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.040> see<00:02:12.250> what's<00:02:12.430> at<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> end

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.120 

oh<00:02:18.690> hey<00:02:19.690> what<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> coincidence<00:02:19.990> there's<00:02:20.980> some

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
oh hey what a coincidence there's some

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.810 
oh hey what a coincidence there's some
diamonds<00:02:21.340> here<00:02:21.670> all<00:02:22.570> right<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.820> guess

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
diamonds here all right so I guess

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.760 
diamonds here all right so I guess
that's<00:02:25.030> where<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.750> water<00:02:25.930> also<00:02:26.140> comes<00:02:26.530> into

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
that's where the water also comes into

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:47.000 
that's where the water also comes into
play<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.270> go<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.710> planned

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.069 

bye
