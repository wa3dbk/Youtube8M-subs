the duration of phase lock I always
recommend<00:01:46.710> being<00:01:47.189> able<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.490> make<00:01:47.670> your

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.179 
possible so a great thing to research
all<00:01:53.460> five<00:01:53.700> points<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:55.049> sounds<00:01:55.439> fun<00:01:55.740> after

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
all five points this sounds fun after

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
all five points this sounds fun after
you<00:01:56.280> kill<00:01:56.460> someone<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.630> deflect<00:01:57.960> bullets

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you kill someone you can deflect bullets

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.770 
you kill someone you can deflect bullets
and<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.070> hit<00:01:59.219> other<00:01:59.460> people<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.540> now

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and have them hit other people but now

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.059 
and have them hit other people but now
that's<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.170> fun<00:02:02.299> converge<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.619> add<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
that's just fun converge this will add a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.240 
that's just fun converge this will add a
condition<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.989> phase<00:02:09.989> lock<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.590> pulls<00:02:11.009> other

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
condition to phase lock that pulls other

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.589 
condition to phase lock that pulls other
enemies<00:02:11.610> towards<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.330> guess<00:02:12.510> if

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
enemies towards them so I guess if

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.820 
enemies towards them so I guess if
you're<00:02:12.690> concentrating<00:02:13.050> fire

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you're concentrating fire

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400 
you're concentrating fire
towards<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.550> target<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.480> helps<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.170> seems

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
towards a target that helps that seems

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.190 
towards a target that helps that seems
fun<00:02:17.150> hopefully<00:02:18.150> that'll<00:02:18.330> look<00:02:18.480> cool<00:02:18.540> people

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
fun hopefully that'll look cool people

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.330

now<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> last<00:03:17.910> game<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.450> siren<00:03:18.870> was<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
now in the last game the siren was the

now in the last game the siren was the
elemental<00:03:19.890> expert<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.320> this<00:03:22.320> allows<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.130> to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
be the elemental expert once again so

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
be the elemental expert once again so

bounced<00:03:32.130> over<00:03:32.280> here<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:34.080> old<00:03:34.380> game<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:35.040> let

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
bounced over here the old game it let

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.350 
bounced over here the old game it let
you<00:03:36.290> have<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> perk<00:03:37.650> where<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:38.250> had<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> fiery

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
you have a perk where you had a fiery

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.479 
you have a perk where you had a fiery
explosion<00:03:39.600> around<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.500> when<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.739> went<00:03:40.980> in

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
explosion around you when you went in

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.610 
explosion around you when you went in
and<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:42.060> phase<00:03:42.570> walking<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.950> does<00:03:44.370> it

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
and out of phase walking this does it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.800 
and out of phase walking this does it
now<00:03:46.620> phase<00:03:47.040> locking<00:03:47.310> an<00:03:47.700> enemy<00:03:48.239> causes<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.600> fire

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
now phase locking an enemy causes a fire

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.930 
now phase locking an enemy causes a fire
explosion<00:03:49.320> damaging<00:03:50.100> all<00:03:50.250> nearby<00:03:50.519> enemies

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
explosion damaging all nearby enemies

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.580 
explosion damaging all nearby enemies
I'm<00:03:51.090> assuming<00:03:51.600> that's<00:03:51.750> around<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.140> enemy<00:03:52.290> you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
I'm assuming that's around the enemy you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.449 
I'm assuming that's around the enemy you
have<00:03:52.620> phase<00:03:52.890> lock<00:03:53.190> not<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:56.160> chain

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
have phase lock not you and a chain

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.509 
have phase lock not you and a chain
reaction<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:57.420> seems<00:03:57.690> cool<00:03:57.930> two<00:03:58.519> phase

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
reaction this seems cool two phase

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.550 
reaction this seems cool two phase
locking<00:03:59.550> when<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.870> have<00:04:01.050> one<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.260> your<00:04:01.380> shots

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
locking when you have one of your shots

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.120 
locking when you have one of your shots
hit<00:04:01.739> an<00:04:01.830> enemy

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
hit an enemy

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.920 
hit an enemy
it<00:04:02.310> can<00:04:02.459> ricochet<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.030> hit<00:04:03.090> more<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:03.750> that's

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
it can ricochet and hit more so that's

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.930 
it can ricochet and hit more so that's
kind<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.440> reverse<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.340> what<00:04:05.400> kinetic

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
kind of the reverse of what kinetic

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.670 
kind of the reverse of what kinetic
reflection<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:07.110> again<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.380> just<00:04:07.410> seems

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
reflection is and again it just seems

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.590 
reflection is and again it just seems
fun<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.070> seems<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.370> more<00:04:08.519> damage<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.209> the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
fun it seems like more damage for the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.870 
fun it seems like more damage for the
same<00:04:10.019> amount<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.320> bullets<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.860> not<00:04:11.580> even<00:04:11.790> your

same amount of bullets and not even your

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.449 
same amount of bullets and not even your
bullets<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.269> this<00:04:12.390> case<00:04:12.590> cloud<00:04:13.590> kill<00:04:13.860> when<00:04:14.430> you

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
bullets in this case cloud kill when you

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.670 
bullets in this case cloud kill when you
shoot<00:04:14.670> someone<00:04:14.880> there's<00:04:15.540> acid<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:16.380> them

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
shoot someone there's acid on them

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.430 
shoot someone there's acid on them
that's<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.580> similar<00:04:17.910> perk<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:19.019> previous

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
that's a similar perk to the previous

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.580 
that's a similar perk to the previous
siren<00:04:19.799> from<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.489> first<00:04:20.729> Borderlands<00:04:21.590> they

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
siren from the first Borderlands they

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.640 
siren from the first Borderlands they
had<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> corrosive<00:04:23.310> perk<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.360> maybe<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.470> looks

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
had a corrosive perk and maybe it looks

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.620 
had a corrosive perk and maybe it looks
cool<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:26.039> haven't<00:04:26.370> played<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.090> so

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
cool I haven't played this so

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.280 
cool I haven't played this so
hopefully<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.770> looks<00:04:28.860> cool<00:04:29.160> as<00:04:29.310> well<00:04:29.520> and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
hopefully that looks cool as well and

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.990 
hopefully that looks cool as well and
the<00:04:31.290> backdraft<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:32.130> use<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.640> rest<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.940> my

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the backdraft I use up the rest of my

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.650 
the backdraft I use up the rest of my
points<00:04:33.450> in<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:34.710> perk<00:04:35.240> when<00:04:36.240> your<00:04:36.390> shields

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
points in this perk when your shields

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.120 
points in this perk when your shields
didn't<00:04:37.110> become<00:04:37.290> depleted<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.860> create<00:04:38.070> a

didn't become depleted you create a

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.070 
didn't become depleted you create a
fiery<00:04:38.430> explosion<00:04:38.670> so<00:04:39.300> great<00:04:39.540> that's<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.870> perk

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
fiery explosion so great that's the perk

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.430 
fiery explosion so great that's the perk
from<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> previous<00:04:40.800> game<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.810> also<00:04:43.080> adds

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
from the previous game and it also adds

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.280 
from the previous game and it also adds
fire<00:04:43.890> damage<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.400> your<00:04:44.670> melee<00:04:45.060> attacks<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.900> I
