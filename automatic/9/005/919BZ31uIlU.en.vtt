00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.840
Playing tennis with special rackets

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.900
Tennis is a popular sport in Vietnam's major cities.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.200
Throughout the country, men view a proper tennis racket as an indispensable to the game.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.000
However many players in Ho Chi Minh City now play the game 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.260
with “rackets” made of wine bottles, wooden chairs and even pieces of pattern tile.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The special rackets make the game more difficult,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:50.360
but the more difficult it is to play with the strange tools, the more interesting the game becomes.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:07.000
Do Thanh Hoang, ex-national team player: “Special “rackets” require much more skill and talent from the player.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You have to practice for a long time to get acquainted to the wood 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.200
or tile surface of the new rackets to make you movements more exact.”

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.600
To the players who use them, their special rackets have become parts of the kit bags 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.600
they bring to practice and rounds of friendly competition.
