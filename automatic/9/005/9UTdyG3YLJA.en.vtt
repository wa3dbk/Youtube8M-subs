just<00:02:06.330> got<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.540> viously<00:02:06.930> line<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.440> dots<00:02:07.620> the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
just got to viously line up the dots the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.170 
just got to viously line up the dots the
red<00:02:08.250> dot<00:02:08.460> with<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.760> red<00:02:08.940> dot<00:02:09.260> like<00:02:10.260> so<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
red dot with the red dot like so and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.810 
red dot with the red dot like so and
then<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.300> crank<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.020> now<00:02:13.700> when<00:02:14.700> i<00:02:14.730> first

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
then you crank it on now when i first

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.910 
then you crank it on now when i first
got<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.840> was<00:02:15.960> much<00:02:16.200> tighter<00:02:16.470> than<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.800> is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
got this it was much tighter than it is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
got this it was much tighter than it is
right<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:18.240> did<00:02:18.480> loosen<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:18.960> quite<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
right now so it did loosen up quite a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.810 
right now so it did loosen up quite a
bit<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.590> still<00:02:19.620> pretty<00:02:19.920> tight<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.490> could

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
bit it's still pretty tight you could

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.760 
bit it's still pretty tight you could
see<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.690> I'm<00:02:21.780> trying<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.580> unscrew<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:24.770> like

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
see what I'm trying to unscrew it like

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.890 
see what I'm trying to unscrew it like
there<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.400> I'm<00:02:26.580> putting<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:26.970> now<00:02:27.660> right

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
there it is I'm putting it on now right

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.710 
there it is I'm putting it on now right
here<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.380> where<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.620> gets<00:02:28.650> tight<00:02:29.690> like<00:02:30.690> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
here is where it gets tight like that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.330 
here is where it gets tight like that
last<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.320> bit<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.620> could<00:02:31.740> hear<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
last little bit you could hear it I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.640 
last little bit you could hear it I
would<00:02:32.820> not<00:02:32.970> put<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.570> attach<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
would not put this on attach to the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.530 
would not put this on attach to the
camera<00:02:35.040> itself<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.580> would<00:02:35.640> attach<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
camera itself I would attach it to the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.560 
camera itself I would attach it to the
adapter<00:02:37.170> first<00:02:37.440> then<00:02:37.770> put<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> camera

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
adapter first then put it on the camera

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.250 
adapter first then put it on the camera
alright<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:40.380> here's<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:41.100> next<00:02:41.340> six<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.200> let<00:02:43.200> me

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
alright so here's my next six and let me

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.229 
alright so here's my next six and let me
just<00:02:43.320> put<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.680> down<00:02:43.739> for<00:02:43.920> one<00:02:44.220> second<00:02:44.610> then

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
just put this down for one second then

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.640 
just put this down for one second then
I'll<00:02:45.390> screw<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.530> there<00:02:52.530> we

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I'll screw this on like so and there we

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.050 
I'll screw this on like so and there we
have<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.350 

all<00:02:55.690> right<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.080> what<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> got<00:02:56.890> here<00:02:57.220> now<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.670> this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
all right so what I got here now is this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.770 
all right so what I got here now is this
my<00:02:58.840> Sony<00:02:59.110> NEX<00:02:59.380> six<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.550> have<00:03:00.700> my<00:03:00.910> Canon<00:03:01.300> 24

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
my Sony NEX six and I have my Canon 24

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.059 
my Sony NEX six and I have my Canon 24
to<00:03:02.160> 105<00:03:03.160> f/4<00:03:04.060> l<00:03:04.090> lens<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.870> really<00:03:05.770> like<00:03:05.920> this

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
to 105 f/4 l lens I really like this

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.280 
to 105 f/4 l lens I really like this
lens<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.700> f/4<00:03:07.120> aperture<00:03:07.630> makes<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
lens because the f/4 aperture makes the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.930 
lens because the f/4 aperture makes the
glass<00:03:08.500> pretty<00:03:08.800> small<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.580> relatively

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
glass pretty small so it's relatively

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.520 
glass pretty small so it's relatively
light<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:11.020> has<00:03:11.170> image<00:03:11.500> stabilization

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
light and it has image stabilization

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.240 
light and it has image stabilization
which<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:14.020> f4<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.830> little<00:03:15.130> bit

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
which I have on the f4 is a little bit

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.610 
which I have on the f4 is a little bit
slower<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.940> know<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.330> sometimes<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:17.500> know

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
slower you know so sometimes you know

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.020 
slower you know so sometimes you know
the<00:03:17.800> shutter<00:03:17.980> speed<00:03:18.160> will<00:03:18.520> be<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.640> little<00:03:18.910> bit

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the shutter speed will be a little bit

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.520 
the shutter speed will be a little bit
slower

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
slower

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.800 
slower
hence<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.800> why<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.150> stabilization

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
hence the why I like the stabilization

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.530 
hence the why I like the stabilization
so<00:03:22.989> much<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.770> really<00:03:24.280> works<00:03:24.459> well<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:25.360> what<00:03:25.510> I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
so much it really works well but what I

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.000 
so much it really works well but what I
wanted<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.900> show<00:03:26.050> you<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.350> how<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.560> adapter

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
wanted to show you is how the adapter

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.310 
wanted to show you is how the adapter
works<00:03:27.130> more<00:03:27.459> importantly<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.510> let<00:03:28.810> me<00:03:28.900> swivel

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
works more importantly so let me swivel

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.220 
works more importantly so let me swivel
this<00:03:29.440> around<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.130> see<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.459> side<00:03:31.230> all

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
this around so you can see this side all

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.060 
this around so you can see this side all
right<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.590> now<00:03:32.739> looking<00:03:33.070> at<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.340> screen<00:03:33.700> you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
right so now looking at the screen you

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.509 
right so now looking at the screen you
can<00:03:36.070> clearly<00:03:36.550> see<00:03:37.030> how<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:38.080> adapter<00:03:38.590> works

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
can clearly see how the adapter works

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.550 
can clearly see how the adapter works
you<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.480> aperture<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.140> could<00:03:41.380> change

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
you can see the aperture I could change

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.550 
you can see the aperture I could change
it<00:03:41.739> it's<00:03:41.860> at<00:03:41.980> f/4<00:03:43.080> right<00:03:44.080> now<00:03:44.260> I'm<00:03:44.380> changing

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
it it's at f/4 right now I'm changing

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.300 
it it's at f/4 right now I'm changing
it's<00:03:44.890> at<00:03:45.010> f/8<00:03:45.370> bah-bah-bah<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:48.220> just

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
it's at f/8 bah-bah-bah so I'm just

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.460 
it's at f/8 bah-bah-bah so I'm just
gonna<00:03:48.400> leave<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:48.700> at<00:03:48.880> f/4<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:49.600> I'm<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.380> gonna

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
gonna leave it at f/4 and I'm just gonna

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.250 
gonna leave it at f/4 and I'm just gonna
show<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.709> how<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:50.980> focuses<00:03:54.150> see<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:58.140> so<00:03:59.140> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
show you how it focuses see that so it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.009 
show you how it focuses see that so it
goes<00:03:59.380> back<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.829> forth<00:03:59.860> contrast<00:04:00.730> AF<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.450> then

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
goes back and forth contrast AF and then

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.620 
goes back and forth contrast AF and then
it<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.860> know<00:04:02.890> eventually<00:04:03.400> locks<00:04:03.820> on<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.329> mean

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
it you know eventually locks on I mean

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.940 
it you know eventually locks on I mean
it's<00:04:04.780> slow<00:04:05.640> not<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.850> bad<00:04:07.090> Oh<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:08.530> let<00:04:08.680> me<00:04:08.769> zoom

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
it's slow not that bad Oh so let me zoom

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.699 
it's slow not that bad Oh so let me zoom
in<00:04:09.160> here<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:10.570> adapter<00:04:11.110> will<00:04:11.290> go<00:04:11.470> back<00:04:11.680> and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
in here the adapter will go back and

features and the limit the stabilization

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.560 
features and the limit the stabilization
to<00:05:51.870> try<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.080> conserve<00:05:52.380> battery<00:05:52.650> power<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:53.570> would

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
in that I'm using the adapter because I

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.180
