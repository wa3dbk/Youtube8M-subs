00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 good afternoon this video came back 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.649
 on your numerous reviews and 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.320
 wishes and so knees 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.570
 let's hope that this video you already 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.429
 looked therefore at the theory 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 the first will not stop 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.060
 lyrical digression means there is 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.240
 three types of squat mean first kind of prize 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 this is when this angle is 90 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.920
 degrees here's the second kind of additive when 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 the thigh is parallel to the ground its vault and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.290
 the third kind of squat is when we sit down 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.690
 the floor on the knee joint works in each 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 Of the three cases , the most different 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 safe is the first when corner 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.539
 is 90 degrees in this sit down and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 let's not knead the second 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.199
 lyrical digression 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 Means here such movements knees when 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.559
 she goes like that for a break or like that for 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.629
 kink are dangerous to the knee 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.360
 around you need to do them very 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.130
 gently and slowly before starting 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.619
 physical workout I usually recommend 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.830
 produce a little bit mental ie 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.590
 psyche warm up a little bit colleagues for 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.170
 to make it easier to take the news 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.060
 let's go learn to invest psyche 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 rubbing hands 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.680

 slippers on toes and turning inwards 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.680
 everyone has finished focusing on the foot at these 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.820
 movements you completely roll over to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.820
 edges of the foot here 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.870
 that is, strengthen the ankle further 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.770

 you have a whole meniscus so front and back 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.210
 up to the knee you can do this 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.640
 movement to fasten 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:52.030
 more that is a little bit pushing yourself 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:59.340
 back all the first stage is ready the second stage 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.340
 legs more than shoulder-width become the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.050
 it all depends on your physical 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.110
 opportunities, you can put your feet wider 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.209
 it is already possible for someone how convenient it would be 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.040
 more than shoulder width and drove again 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.260
 here you can clearly see 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.410
 dangerous load i.e. slowly 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.410
 Here is a dangerous load, too, slowly we go 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.900
 controls pitch bend angle knee up 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.380
 90 degrees a little rested and 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.380

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:45.930
 knees running quietly you 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.930
 we twist one side and the other 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.120

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.900
 muscle pain 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.690
 it's all quite regular because you 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.670
 now knead those muscles that are 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.460
 ordinary life almost do not use 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.740
 but these muscles are used when 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.860
 advocates an abnormal situation in the knee you 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.710
 slipped fell twisted foot that 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.040
 until you these muscles and will save from wounds after 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.290

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.640
 better four five movements in each 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.350
 side of this is enough if control in
