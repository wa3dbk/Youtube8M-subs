all<00:00:08.189> right<00:00:08.430> here's<00:00:08.969> the<00:00:09.059> drift<00:00:09.420> HD<00:00:09.600> 170

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
all right here's the drift HD 170

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.670 
all right here's the drift HD 170
stealth<00:00:11.540> this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.840> take<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.110> apart<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
stealth this is how you take it apart to

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.830 
stealth this is how you take it apart to
get<00:00:13.799> your<00:00:14.459> new<00:00:14.610> lens<00:00:14.879> in<00:00:15.090> there<00:00:15.240> probably<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
get your new lens in there probably the

thing is take the eight screws that are
on<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> back<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.880> your<00:00:21.630> stealth<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:30.769> once<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
on the back of your stealth out once you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.729 
on the back of your stealth out once you
get<00:00:32.009> them<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.250> removed<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:34.320> whole<00:00:34.530> back

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
get them all removed the whole back

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:45.370 
get them all removed the whole back
piece<00:00:34.770> should<00:00:35.220> come<00:00:35.400> off<00:00:43.820> then<00:00:44.820> you'll<00:00:44.970> notice

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
piece should come off then you'll notice

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.930 
piece should come off then you'll notice
there<00:00:46.380> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.650> battery<00:00:47.040> compartment<00:00:47.700> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
there is a battery compartment that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.110 
there is a battery compartment that
thing<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.390> taken<00:00:48.990> out<00:00:49.550> as<00:00:50.550> well<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
thing can be taken out as well as the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.830 
thing can be taken out as well as the
spring<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.930> underneath<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.500> stuff

so<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.250> lose<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.790> they'll<00:01:05.909> just

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so you don't lose them or they'll just

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.169 
so you don't lose them or they'll just
kind<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.299> fall<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.710> their<00:01:08.070> each<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.579> both

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
kind of fall out on their each on both

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.580 
kind of fall out on their each on both
the<00:01:09.329> sides<00:01:09.509> then<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.259> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> do

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the sides then what you're going to do

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.819 
the sides then what you're going to do
is<00:01:11.429> take<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> outer<00:01:12.229> rubber<00:01:13.229> ring<00:01:13.560> that's

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
is take the outer rubber ring that's

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.109 
is take the outer rubber ring that's
around<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.130> whole<00:01:14.280> drift<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.729> stretch<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
around the whole drift and stretch it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.599 
around the whole drift and stretch it
over<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.899> over<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.829> lens<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.399> you<00:01:17.490> can

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
over the over the lens so you can

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:18.859 
over the over the lens so you can
actually<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:17.999> screws<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
actually get the screws out that you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.280 
actually get the screws out that you
need<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.170> out

now you'll notice that there's four

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.270 
now you'll notice that there's four
screws<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.780> circuit<00:01:26.170> board<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.920> connect

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
screws on the circuit board and connect

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.860 
screws on the circuit board and connect
the<00:01:27.550> lens<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.420> camera<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.660> want<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
the lens to the camera what you want to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.410 
the lens to the camera what you want to
do<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.110> remove<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.470> four<00:01:32.680> screws<00:01:33.420> sometimes

do is remove the four screws sometimes

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.590 
do is remove the four screws sometimes
there<00:01:34.660> might<00:01:34.780> be<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:34.960> screw<00:01:35.290> that<00:01:35.440> has<00:01:35.620> hot<00:01:35.890> glue

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
there might be a screw that has hot glue

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.380 
there might be a screw that has hot glue
that<00:01:37.600> was<00:01:38.350> all<00:01:38.680> over<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.370> best<00:01:39.580> way<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.820> get

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
that was all over it the best way to get

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.730 
that was all over it the best way to get
to<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.660> screw<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.080> basically<00:01:41.410> just<00:01:41.470> take<00:01:41.710> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
to that screw is basically just take a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.760 
to that screw is basically just take a
heat<00:01:42.250> gun<00:01:42.430> or<00:01:42.729> lighter<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:43.870> heat<00:01:44.350> up<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
heat gun or lighter and just heat up the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.460 
heat gun or lighter and just heat up the
tip<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.160> your<00:01:45.370> screwdriver<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.330> then<00:01:47.020> let<00:01:47.380> it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
tip of your screwdriver and then let it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.140 
tip of your screwdriver and then let it
melt<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.830> glue<00:01:48.010> while<00:01:48.280> you're<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.790> screen

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
melt the glue while you're on screen

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.630 
melt the glue while you're on screen
screw<00:01:49.800> all<00:01:50.800> right<00:01:51.010> now<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.370> got<00:01:51.490> that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
screw all right now that you got that

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.620 
screw all right now that you got that
removed<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.530> next<00:01:53.770> thing<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.940> take<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
removed the next thing is to take the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.880 
removed the next thing is to take the
lens<00:01:55.950> shaft<00:01:56.950> out<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.750> cover<00:01:59.020> that's<00:01:59.650> in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
lens shaft out of the cover that's in

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.380 
lens shaft out of the cover that's in
front<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.460> drift<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.060> should<00:02:01.210> just

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
front of the drift and it should just

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.120 
front of the drift and it should just
easily<00:02:01.660> come<00:02:01.869> out<00:02:04.440> now<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.710> have<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
easily come out now you just have the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.930 
easily come out now you just have the
lens<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.729> shaft<00:02:11.640> basically<00:02:12.640> I'm<00:02:12.790> screwed

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
lens and the shaft basically I'm screwed

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.790 
lens and the shaft basically I'm screwed
with<00:02:13.209> your<00:02:13.390> original<00:02:13.540> lens<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.590> there

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
with your original lens that's in there

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.060 
with your original lens that's in there
and<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.060> put<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.420> your<00:02:16.450> new<00:02:16.870> 2.8<00:02:17.620> or

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
and you can put in your new 2.8 or

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.280 
and you can put in your new 2.8 or
whatever<00:02:18.610> lens<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.000> ordered<00:02:19.330> from<00:02:19.480> us<00:02:19.660> into

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
whatever lens you ordered from us into

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:33.690 
whatever lens you ordered from us into
the<00:02:20.410> shaft

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.059 

so<00:02:34.270> once<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.660> get<00:02:34.810> somewhat<00:02:35.349> set<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.709> we<00:02:35.920> can

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
so once we get somewhat set in we can

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.820 
so once we get somewhat set in we can
put<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> lunch<00:02:37.180> chef<00:02:37.450> back<00:02:37.870> onto<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.530> circuit

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
put a lunch chef back onto the circuit

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.860 
put a lunch chef back onto the circuit
board<00:02:38.980> by<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.430> putting<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.269> two<00:02:40.420> screws<00:02:40.750> on

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.030 
board by just putting the two screws on
we<00:02:41.019> don't<00:02:41.170> need<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.410> put<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> cover<00:02:41.830> back<00:02:41.890> on

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:56.720 
we don't need to put the cover back on
at<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.430> time

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.430

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
now once you get both those screws in

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.369 
now once you get both those screws in
and<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:59.580> tight<00:03:00.000> next<00:03:00.540> thing<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.930> put<00:03:01.260> back

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
and it's tight next thing is to put back

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.399 
and it's tight next thing is to put back
the<00:03:01.440> battery<00:03:01.920> compartment<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.549> spring

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
the battery compartment in the spring

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.600 
the battery compartment in the spring
see<00:03:04.409> that<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> spring<00:03:04.920> kind<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.220> slides<00:03:05.489> in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
see that the spring kind just slides in

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.970 
see that the spring kind just slides in
there's<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> little<00:03:05.909> hole<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.799> then

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
there's a little hole there and then

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.770 
there's a little hole there and then
that<00:03:08.370> goes<00:03:08.580> there<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:08.909> then<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.239> put<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
that goes there and then you can put the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.649 
that goes there and then you can put the
battery<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.500> actually<00:03:11.370> power<00:03:11.819> on<00:03:12.120> your
