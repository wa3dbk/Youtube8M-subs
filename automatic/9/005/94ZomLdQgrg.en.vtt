00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.619
 Today a little daintiness from the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.050
 quick kitchen a sesame dip for that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 we need half a lemon 50 grams 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.610
 sesame a pinch of cumin a pinch 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 salt ten grams of olive oil one 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.349
 garlic clove and a small tomato 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.279
 So this really small and 60 degrees 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.110
 First, press half a lemon 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.610
 I have not prepared this time 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 had lemon and not so much 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 at hand I do that otherwise 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 electrically on stock but I had 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.359
 do not have to do that with the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.699
 hand were next I'm the 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.679
 season from that it asked sesame me 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.809
 take so far as a full-fledged it 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.329
 always goes unchecked things and no 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.670
 capable things, etc 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.820
 because the highest empty value 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.129
 have concentrations and also in the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 cola table furthest to the left 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.630
 I give a pinch to spice 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 cumin and I have it here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.909
 tremendously given that we're doing it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.570
 painted the sesame and the salt I have 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.250
 Spoken in the text it is a pinch 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 but really only a teaspoon like me 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.670
 written on it and this 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.570
 I can now use dry ingredients 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.980
 together on the magic paint 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 if you make larger quantities you can do something 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.760
 Of course, I'm in the best shape 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.230
 or I think that is possible on the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.450
 thermomix may not quite work 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.490
 fine but not feasible 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.630
 because you can paint the call with spots 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 ingredients and but these small quantities 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.730
 is the magic maxime unbeatable if that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 now also in the spice mill of 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.440
 other sizes kitchen machine goes white 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.450
 I do not but since it appears again 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.960
 the magic max is still for me 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 quite battered the sesame is very 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.340
 That's why I stop oil when I see the sparkle 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.290
 paint with the corpse of his pampe and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.280
 then sets up you have to with 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.660
 just put the spoon away as I do that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 with the small appliances was complete 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.920
 the garlic cloves who a bigger one 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.170
 quantity of vitamins market can be the ten 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.379
 Really also changed only 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.659
 Cut off the hard end below 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.200
 and here to this mixa not to the 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.280
 limit its capacity 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.110
 chop the garlic before small 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.489
 Now I add the lemon juice and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.140
 then it is very important to me if I already 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.480
 sectors of press that the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.879
 meat with it give for this is he 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.049
 really not only one 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.180
 waste but also from 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.189
 health point of view a herber 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.900
 loss 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.000
 now comes the olive oil you can 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.129
 Of course, take a sesame oil with it 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.159
 the sesame taste where just stronger 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.370
 the tomato should not be too hard 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.099
 the further she is and the musician there 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.500
 can be processed then 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.849
 please be aware that the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.129
 nose of all things small devices one 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.450
 working hours do not have to be longer 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.329
 should be considered a minute 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.370
 but that was enough as well 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.500
 now not shortened I have room 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.450
 Overall, the whole thing terribly fast 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.799
 goes and is therefore synonymous for movies long 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.359
 time the mixing process uncut 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.519
 calmly 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.940
 so that looks like a pad is almost already 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.690
 I think that's for the audience 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.220
 in connection 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.199
 You can decorate it now 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.150
 of course not when I enter 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.010
 bit of mint or a bit 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.139
 parsley everything wonderful if this 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.730
 delicious food now after that makes 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.730
 wishes good appetite
