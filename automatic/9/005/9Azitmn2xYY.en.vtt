run out of relevant topics and one that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
run out of relevant topics and one that
is<00:00:44.309> irrelevant<00:00:44.700> topics<00:00:45.120> you're<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.930> oh<00:00:46.079> do

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is irrelevant topics you're like oh do

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.660 
is irrelevant topics you're like oh do
that<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.680> dude<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> game<00:00:47.129> plan<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.520> you're

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that go dude a game plan and then you're

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250

trying super hard to get a gameplay and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.360 
trying super hard to get a gameplay and
then<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.530> rougher<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.219> you're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
then it's rougher because you're

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
then it's rougher because you're
psyching<00:00:50.730> yourself<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.199> of

psyching yourself out this is kind of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.189 
psyching yourself out this is kind of
like<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> let<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.280> happen<00:00:53.520> naturally

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199

a lot of people you know pushing that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.480 
a lot of people you know pushing that
high<00:03:06.170> sensitivity<00:03:06.740> you<00:03:06.980> gotta<00:03:07.160> get<00:03:07.250> used<00:03:07.400> to

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
high sensitivity you gotta get used to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.930 
high sensitivity you gotta get used to
high<00:03:07.790> sensitivity<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.780> false<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:10.520> do

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
high sensitivity that is false do not do

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.610 
high sensitivity that is false do not do
that<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.330> used<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:12.020> was<00:03:12.230> playing<00:03:12.410> a

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
that I used to do that I was playing a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.880 
that I used to do that I was playing a
14<00:03:13.100> before<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.570> was<00:03:14.720> good<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.110> 14<00:03:15.590> but

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
14 before and like I was good on 14 but

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.680 
14 before and like I was good on 14 but
I<00:03:16.010> was<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.640> much<00:03:16.850> better<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.540> lower

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
I was so much better on the lower

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.470 
I was so much better on the lower
sensitivity<00:03:17.990> I've<00:03:18.800> recently<00:03:19.460> when<00:03:20.210> I<00:03:20.240> found

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
sensitivity I've recently when I found

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.570 
sensitivity I've recently when I found
out<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.990> pros<00:03:21.230> are<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:21.650> using<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.280> like

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
out that the pros are like using to like

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.490 
out that the pros are like using to like
two<00:03:22.760> three<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.300> four<00:03:23.660> sensitivity<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.410> was

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
two three and four sensitivity I was

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.680 
two three and four sensitivity I was
like<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:25.070> it's<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.910> saying<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.360> that's<00:03:26.480> how

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
like what it's is saying but that's how

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.720 
like what it's is saying but that's how
they<00:03:26.870> hit<00:03:27.080> those<00:03:27.260> super<00:03:27.680> accurate<00:03:27.920> shots<00:03:28.520> is

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
they hit those super accurate shots is

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.890 
they hit those super accurate shots is
because<00:03:28.910> they<00:03:29.030> play<00:03:29.240> on<00:03:29.420> super<00:03:29.780> low

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
because they play on super low

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.560 
because they play on super low
sensitivities<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.730> lowered<00:03:32.180> nine<00:03:32.360> down

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
sensitivities so I lowered nine down

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.720 
sensitivities so I lowered nine down
slowly<00:03:33.290> gradually<00:03:33.740> so<00:03:34.160> I'll<00:03:34.250> get<00:03:34.370> used<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.670> it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
slowly gradually so I'll get used to it

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.160 
slowly gradually so I'll get used to it
down<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.240> five<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:35.780> where<00:03:35.930> i'm<00:03:36.020> at<00:03:36.140> right

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
down to five that's where i'm at right

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.630 
down to five that's where i'm at right
now<00:03:36.350> that's<00:03:36.680> what<00:03:36.800> i'm<00:03:36.860> super<00:03:37.190> comfortable

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
now that's what i'm super comfortable

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.220 
now that's what i'm super comfortable
and<00:03:37.790> that's<00:03:38.150> how<00:03:38.270> i've<00:03:38.390> been<00:03:38.540> playing<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.080> much

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
and that's how i've been playing so much

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.440 
and that's how i've been playing so much
better<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.590> just<00:03:39.860> make<00:03:40.190> sure<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.400> know<00:03:40.550> spawns<00:03:41.180> in

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
better I just make sure I know spawns in

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.210 
better I just make sure I know spawns in
a<00:03:41.930> map<00:03:42.170> sometimes<00:03:42.680> are<00:03:42.770> unpredictable

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
a map sometimes are unpredictable

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.890 
a map sometimes are unpredictable
sometimes<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:44.090> goes<00:03:44.180> somewhere<00:03:44.420> else<00:03:44.540> or

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
sometimes it goes somewhere else or

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.330 
sometimes it goes somewhere else or
right<00:03:45.110> on<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:45.860> happens<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.190> me<00:03:46.310> a

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
right on you and that happens to me a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.370 
right on you and that happens to me a
lot<00:03:46.400> but<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.570> most<00:03:47.720> part<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.080> can't

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
lot but for the most part you can't

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.200 
lot but for the most part you can't
predict<00:03:48.770> them<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:49.460> can<00:03:49.610> keep<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.940> people

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
predict them and you can keep the people

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.310 
predict them and you can keep the people
in<00:03:50.300> front<00:03:50.330> of<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.780> that's<00:03:50.900> where<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
in front of you and that's where the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.930 
in front of you and that's where the
aiming<00:03:51.740> matters<00:03:52.130> if<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.400> can<00:03:52.550> keep<00:03:52.700> them<00:03:52.820> in

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
aiming matters if you can keep them in

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.460 
aiming matters if you can keep them in
front<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.240> you<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.540> can<00:03:53.690> land<00:03:53.960> your<00:03:54.170> shots

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
front of you and you can land your shots

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.680 
front of you and you can land your shots
when<00:03:54.740> you<00:03:54.860> need<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.100> land<00:03:55.340> your<00:03:55.490> shots<00:03:55.790> every

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
when you need to land your shots every

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.690 
when you need to land your shots every
time<00:03:56.930> you're<00:03:57.860> gonna<00:03:57.980> win<00:03:58.220> you're<00:03:58.400> gonna<00:03:58.460> do

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
time you're gonna win you're gonna do

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.370 
time you're gonna win you're gonna do
good<00:03:58.940> you're<00:03:59.480> gonna<00:03:59.570> play<00:03:59.810> better<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:00.110> not

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
good you're gonna play better and not

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.960 
good you're gonna play better and not
too<00:04:00.560> much<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.800> do<00:04:00.890> have<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.160> scout<00:04:01.400> controller<00:04:01.760> so

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
too much I do have a scout controller so

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.420 
too much I do have a scout controller so
that<00:04:02.120> obviously<00:04:02.240> helps<00:04:02.780> as<00:04:02.900> well<00:04:03.130> but<00:04:04.130> still

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
that obviously helps as well but still

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.550 
that obviously helps as well but still
