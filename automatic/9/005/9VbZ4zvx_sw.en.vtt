interesting<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.970> ever

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
interesting because I think if I ever

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.490 
interesting because I think if I ever
gonna<00:01:54.300> move<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> power<00:01:54.840> supply<00:01:55.170> will<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.410> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
gonna move the power supply will be in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.290 
gonna move the power supply will be in
the<00:01:55.590> case<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.429> don't<00:01:56.789> know<00:01:57.030> why<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> never

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
the case so I don't know why I never

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.520 
the case so I don't know why I never
used<00:01:57.660> something<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.410> like<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
used something like this it's like a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.419 
used something like this it's like a
velvet<00:01:58.920> build<00:01:59.520> material<00:02:00.020> all<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.320> mm<00:02:02.190> I

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
velvet build material all right mm I

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.770 
velvet build material all right mm I
guess<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.970> nice<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.660> don't

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

guess it's nice to have but I don't
think<00:02:03.899> we'll<00:02:03.990> ever<00:02:04.020> use<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:06.560> all<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:11.390> okay

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
think we'll ever use it all right okay

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.770 
think we'll ever use it all right okay
it's<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.800> power<00:02:14.010> supply<00:02:14.340> right<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:14.580> mm-hmm

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
it's the power supply right here mm-hmm

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.840 
it's the power supply right here mm-hmm
here's<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.830> ports<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.459> all<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> power

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850

here's all the ports for all the power
cables<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.600> sets<00:02:18.870> fully<00:02:19.170> modular<00:02:19.410> which<00:02:19.800> is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
cables like sets fully modular which is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.229 
cables like sets fully modular which is
nice<00:02:20.100> maybe<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.819> some<00:02:20.940> good<00:02:21.090> cable

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
nice maybe get some good cable

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.680 
nice maybe get some good cable
management<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.709> I'm<00:02:22.800> hoping<00:02:23.100> for

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
management out of this so I'm hoping for

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.180 
management out of this so I'm hoping for
here's<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.750> switch<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> fan<00:02:25.739> right<00:02:26.040> here

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
here's a switch for the fan right here

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.970 
here's a switch for the fan right here
you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.120> go<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.530> Huayra<00:02:28.530> mode<00:02:28.799> right

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
you can go in the Huayra mode right

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
you can go in the Huayra mode right
there<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> pretty<00:02:29.970> much<00:02:30.090> hybrid<00:02:30.750> mode<00:02:30.900> what

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
there and pretty much hybrid mode what

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.979 
there and pretty much hybrid mode what
that<00:02:31.230> does<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.590> up<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> 20<00:02:32.549> percent<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.180> 20

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
that does is up to 20 percent the 20

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.319 
that does is up to 20 percent the 20
percent<00:02:34.200> power<00:02:34.320> load<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> fan<00:02:34.890> will<00:02:35.100> stay<00:02:36.090> off

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
percent power load the fan will stay off

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.850 
percent power load the fan will stay off
and<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:36.810> from<00:02:36.959> 20<00:02:37.230> percent<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.530> 50<00:02:37.829> percent

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and then from 20 percent to 50 percent

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.850 
and then from 20 percent to 50 percent
the<00:02:38.340> fan<00:02:38.519> will<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.090> quiet<00:02:39.870> mode<00:02:40.110> which

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the fan will go on and quiet mode which

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.039 
the fan will go on and quiet mode which
is<00:02:41.040> rated<00:02:41.310> about<00:02:41.519> 60<00:02:42.030> decibels<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.750> mean<00:02:42.900> take

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
is rated about 60 decibels I mean take

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.289 
is rated about 60 decibels I mean take
that<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.350> what<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.530> will<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.610> from<00:02:44.790> 50%

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
that for what you will and then from 50%

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.560 
that for what you will and then from 50%
to<00:02:45.510> 100%<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:46.290> famil<00:02:46.850> ramped<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.060> however

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
to 100% the famil ramped up for however

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.910 
to 100% the famil ramped up for however
much<00:02:48.780> cooling<00:02:49.110> needs<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.470> done<00:02:49.650> so

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
much cooling needs to be done so

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.979 
much cooling needs to be done so
hopefully<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.120> should<00:02:51.299> give<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.630> pretty<00:02:51.780> quiet

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
hopefully it should give it pretty quiet

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.170 
hopefully it should give it pretty quiet

computing computing from the power
supply<00:02:54.450> at<00:02:54.540> least<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:56.040> that's<00:02:56.220> nice<00:02:56.750> alright

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
supply at least so that's nice alright

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.979 
supply at least so that's nice alright
let's<00:02:58.140> take<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.350> look<00:02:58.530> at<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> accessories<00:02:59.280> now

let's take a look at the accessories now
all<00:03:00.989> right<00:03:01.170> now<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.040> all<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.820> cables<00:03:03.180> laid

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
all right now I have all the cables laid

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.539 
all right now I have all the cables laid
out<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:03.660> take<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> quick<00:03:04.049> look<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.320> these

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
out and when take a quick look at these

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.150 
out and when take a quick look at these
here<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.850> 24<00:03:06.329> pin<00:03:06.650> ATX<00:03:07.650> power<00:03:07.829> supply

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
here we have the 24 pin ATX power supply

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.670 
here we have the 24 pin ATX power supply
for<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.579> motherboard<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:10.260> cabling

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
for the motherboard and this cabling

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.900 
for the motherboard and this cabling
right<00:03:10.829> here<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.190> earths<00:03:11.459> leaving<00:03:11.850> I

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
right here this is the earths leaving I

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.190 
right here this is the earths leaving I
should<00:03:12.060> say<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.329> nothing<00:03:12.510> fancy<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.079> mean

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
should say this is nothing fancy I mean

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.000 
should say this is nothing fancy I mean
this<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.350> pretty<00:03:13.500> normal

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
this is pretty normal

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
this is pretty normal

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
most of power power supply companies

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.289 
most of power power supply companies
they<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.190> their<00:03:17.370> 24-pin<00:03:18.239> power

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
they do this to their 24-pin power

they do this to their 24-pin power
connectors<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.769> what's<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.609> usually

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
connectors but what's not is usually

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.849 
connectors but what's not is usually
right<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.420> with<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> sleeving<00:03:21.870> stops<00:03:22.200> you

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
right here with the sleeving stops you

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.699 
right here with the sleeving stops you
have<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> multi<00:03:23.370> colored<00:03:23.700> cables<00:03:23.930> but<00:03:24.930> what<00:03:25.140> see

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
have a multi colored cables but what see

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.680 
have a multi colored cables but what see
something<00:03:25.980> has<00:03:26.100> gone<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.400> did<00:03:27.329> is<00:03:27.510> they've

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
something has gone and did is they've

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.780 
something has gone and did is they've
actually<00:03:27.900> painted<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.980> cables<00:03:29.340> black

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
actually painted all the cables black

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.060 
actually painted all the cables black
which<00:03:30.209> i<00:03:30.329> think<00:03:30.390> looks<00:03:30.540> really<00:03:31.079> nice<00:03:31.199> matches

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
which i think looks really nice matches

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.890 
which i think looks really nice matches
this<00:03:32.160> leaving<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:33.299> when<00:03:33.419> you<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.810> your

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
this leaving so when you have it in your

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.750 
this leaving so when you have it in your
own<00:03:34.139> case<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:35.190> plugs<00:03:35.430> into<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
own case and it plugs into the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.170 
own case and it plugs into the
motherboard

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
motherboard

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.119 
motherboard
like<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:37.140> see<00:03:37.409> all<00:03:37.620> those<00:03:37.829> different

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
like that you see all those different

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.380 
like that you see all those different
colors<00:03:38.310> kind<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.700> sticking<00:03:38.879> out<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.239> that's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
colors kind of sticking out and that's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.610 
colors kind of sticking out and that's
not<00:03:39.450> something<00:03:39.659> I<00:03:39.840> really<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.409> kind<00:03:40.590> of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
not something I really like I kind of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.069 
not something I really like I kind of
like<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.859> clean<00:03:41.450> matte<00:03:42.450> black<00:03:42.659> finish<00:03:42.719> of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
like the clean matte black finish of

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.690 
like the clean matte black finish of
these<00:03:43.170> cables<00:03:43.530> right<00:03:43.620> here<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:44.189> looks<00:03:44.340> sleeker

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
these cables right here it looks sleeker

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.709 
these cables right here it looks sleeker
in<00:03:44.819> my<00:03:44.909> opinion<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.870> that's<00:03:46.049> really<00:03:46.739> nice

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:47.719 
in my opinion so that's really nice

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.979 
in my opinion so that's really nice
next<00:03:48.719> we<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.739> pin<00:03:50.189> CPU<00:03:50.989> power

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
next we have to a pin CPU power

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.399 
next we have to a pin CPU power
connectors<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.639> these<00:03:53.730> goes<00:03:53.969> into

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
connectors and one of these goes into

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.509 
connectors and one of these goes into
single<00:03:55.409> four<00:03:55.590> pins<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:55.980> case<00:03:56.129> you<00:03:56.250> have<00:03:56.340> eight

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
single four pins in case you have eight

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.849 
single four pins in case you have eight
plus<00:03:56.700> four<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.019> rog<00:03:58.590> series

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
plus four like the rog series

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.849 
plus four like the rog series
motherboards<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.959> alright<00:04:00.959> next<00:04:01.409> up<00:04:01.620> we

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
motherboards have it alright next up we

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.360 
motherboards have it alright next up we
have<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.549> PCI<00:04:03.540> Express<00:04:03.599> eight<00:04:04.500> pin<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.159> we<00:04:05.280> have

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
have a PCI Express eight pin and we have

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.330 
have a PCI Express eight pin and we have
a<00:04:05.400> 6<00:04:05.670> pin<00:04:05.879> plus<00:04:06.120> two<00:04:06.319> right<00:04:07.319> there<00:04:07.590> right<00:04:08.010> there

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
a 6 pin plus two right there right there

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.259 
a 6 pin plus two right there right there
see<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.329> this<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.889> four<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.970> these

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
see like this and we have four of these

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.409 
see like this and we have four of these
so<00:04:12.599> plenty<00:04:13.470> for<00:04:13.590> SLI<00:04:13.980> or<00:04:14.189> crossfire<00:04:14.609> just<00:04:15.329> like

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
so plenty for SLI or crossfire just like

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.069 
so plenty for SLI or crossfire just like
the<00:04:15.510> box<00:04:15.720> said<00:04:16.190> move<00:04:17.190> these<00:04:17.430> out<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.759> the<00:04:17.820> way

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
the box said move these out of the way

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.020 
the box said move these out of the way
then<00:04:19.079> we<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.979> SATA<00:04:20.280> connectors<00:04:20.699> we

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
then we have the SATA connectors we

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180 
then we have the SATA connectors we
actually<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.329> ten<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.720> these<00:04:21.949> so<00:04:22.949> you<00:04:22.979> can

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
actually have ten of these so you can

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.890 
actually have ten of these so you can
put<00:04:23.370> lots<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:24.090> hard<00:04:25.050> drives<00:04:25.349> or<00:04:25.590> SSDs<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.900> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
put lots of hard drives or SSDs and the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.529 
put lots of hard drives or SSDs and the
way<00:04:28.050> these<00:04:28.259> are<00:04:28.380> kind<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.620> set<00:04:28.830> up<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.910> you'll

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
way these are kind of set up so you'll

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.100 
way these are kind of set up so you'll
have<00:04:30.690> your<00:04:30.840> cages<00:04:31.259> and<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:33.120> have<00:04:33.389> one<00:04:33.900> hard

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
have your cages and you have one hard

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.870 
have your cages and you have one hard
drive<00:04:34.320> right<00:04:35.039> here<00:04:35.280> then<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.610> have<00:04:35.729> another

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
drive right here then you have another

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.330 
drive right here then you have another
one<00:04:36.090> another<00:04:36.479> one<00:04:36.599> and<00:04:36.900> then<00:04:37.770> they<00:04:37.889> just<00:04:38.070> keep

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
one another one and then they just keep

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.950 
one another one and then they just keep
looping<00:04:38.639> down<00:04:38.970> so<00:04:39.330> I'll<00:04:39.449> probably<00:04:39.599> end<00:04:39.840> up

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
looping down so I'll probably end up

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.020 
looping down so I'll probably end up
looking<00:04:40.229> something<00:04:40.260> like<00:04:40.909> something<00:04:41.909> like

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
looking something like something like

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.990 
looking something like something like
that<00:04:42.240> probably<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:42.870> looking<00:04:43.139> at<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.650> and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
that probably not looking at that and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.860 
that probably not looking at that and
that's<00:04:45.000> kind<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.270> nice<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.630> don't<00:04:45.690> have<00:04:45.780> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
that's kind of nice you don't have a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.939 
that's kind of nice you don't have a
bunch<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.139> different<00:04:46.260> cables<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:46.860> have

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
bunch of different cables you just have

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.149 
bunch of different cables you just have
one<00:04:47.070> single<00:04:47.370> cable<00:04:48.320> alright<00:04:49.320> we<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.590> ten<00:04:50.039> of

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
one single cable alright we have ten of

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.790 
one single cable alright we have ten of
these<00:04:50.310> in<00:04:50.370> total<00:04:51.349> right<00:04:52.349> here<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.650> here's

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
these in total right here and here's

take a quick look at these cable ties

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.779 
take a quick look at these cable ties
real<00:05:28.830> quick<00:05:29.009> there's<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.370> thought<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.639> should
