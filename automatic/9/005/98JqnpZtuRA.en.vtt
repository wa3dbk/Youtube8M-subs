special thing about this formation is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.420 
special thing about this formation is
that<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.989> instead<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> free<00:00:41.040> central

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that you have to instead of free central

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
in attacking moves let's move to my

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190 
in attacking moves let's move to my
midfield<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.790> also<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.479> special<00:01:33.689> here

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
midfield it's also a bit special here

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.319 
midfield it's also a bit special here
I<00:01:34.229> play<00:01:35.040> cockers<00:01:35.490> my<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:35.939> center

I play cockers my right center

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.929 
I play cockers my right center
midfielder<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.280> comparison

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
midfielder because I think in comparison

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.300 
midfielder because I think in comparison
to<00:01:38.970> easy<00:01:39.390> he's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> bit<00:01:40.470> better<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.860> defending

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
to easy he's a bit better and defending

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.270 
to easy he's a bit better and defending
because<00:01:41.909> his<00:01:42.030> body<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.390> stronger<00:01:43.130> Alonzo's<00:01:44.130> my

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
because his body is stronger Alonzo's my

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
because his body is stronger Alonzo's my
second<00:01:44.640> central<00:01:44.970> midfielder<00:01:45.390> no<00:01:45.869> question

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
second central midfielder no question

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.039 
second central midfielder no question
about<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.060> know<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.090> Kaka<00:01:48.630> isn't<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
about that and know that Kaka isn't a
