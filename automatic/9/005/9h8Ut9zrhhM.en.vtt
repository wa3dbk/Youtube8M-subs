00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 on television more also more than 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.230
 never families are ten in the morning with 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.690
 four minutes and now the time has arrived 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.170
 of unwinding the mystery we are very 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 tense because today daniel muñoz brings us 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.190
 news that have impacted you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.810
 probably will not be able to believe the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.600
 images that our beloved journalist 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.449
 and researcher has got UFOs 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 UFOs 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.660
 guatemala size or two miles 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.660
 size how are you 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 really huge vanilla is a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.550
 size of size and crystal I want 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 show you the louis I want to show you the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 I want to show dais as the well of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.610
 full because I gave them a dear 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 friend robert houdín who was of his time 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.930
 the former sergeant major of NATO and then 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.930
 well let's see the real why 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 in him he is a dear friend there we are 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.899
 with him precisely in one of these 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.969
 so many congresses with the astronauts the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.920
 cosmonauts the former sergeant major of the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.150
 NATO he started to have all these 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.410
 contacts with the Russians 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.930
 we have the space station 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.060
 international but and well what are we going 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.520
 to see little by little those little ones 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 objects that are pulsating are always 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 present but one of these days of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.990
 suddenly happened what we're going to see there 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.390
 they were in these shots precisely and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.750
 Well, good surprise is that we are 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.130
 seeing there is hulking mind more 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.110
 big that the space station 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.140
 international that we are seeing more 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.150
 near this is the one we see below the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.400
 Cadenatres logo is the station 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.170
 International space is closer 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.290
 close that we're seeing that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.950
 This moment has been already calculated 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.229
 are two thousand miles is that clear to dream of 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.500
 sky and a half that size means 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.570
 that this huge details you see 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.210
 technological clearly you're going to stop 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.040
 how dino to look and the others are 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.530
 taking from one of the modules that is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.050
 will win in progress from the Russians and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.119
 there we have it because this is something more 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.130
 that what we might call a UFO is 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.509
 what the students of UFOs 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.760
 they call mother ships 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.590
 and it's huge how good that we 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.000
 you bring because I told you I had not had 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.180
 the opportunity to see seasonality 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.489
 he had not publicly presented it 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.470
 like this after this we're 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.200
 watching here is my friend marine pop a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.060
 heroine of Russian space flights and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 all as good this picture she 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.430
 presented is the satellite photo games 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.860
 and that line that we see there is another one 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.349
 these incredibly long objects this 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.269
 that left this shadow on the satellite 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.480
 this on this occasion today that headquarters is 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.680
 around 500 miles if not 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.680
 I remember badly among 600 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.209
 kilometers would get us close no 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.030
 infarction that reaches us and has stopped 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.470
 recorded the country there are 625 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.819
 kilometers that are 500 miles 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.250
 approximately it's like the distance of 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.690
 mexico to guadalajara no good is two thousand 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.370
 miles we are talking about 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.940
 of over 3,500 kilometers that is more or 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.800
 less all monterrey 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.500
 straight line 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.190
 even more here in the city of mexico 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.770
 speaking in different ways 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.080
 huge huge and totally and we're 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.760
 before an evidence that had not been seen 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.430
 previously it was showing 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.990
 de marianna is definitely yes but 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.180
 let's see again let's go back to 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.680
 see that since bordering showed because of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 true that is huge 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.610
 in silver for people who are not 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.320
 as informed as you are what he means 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.760
 It means it is civilization is 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.890
 colonizing already the best we have not 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.270
 realized at the same time not colonizing but 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.910
 yes they are surpassing us in a way 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.010
 spectacular in technology and what good 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.210
 this real man robertín has 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.740
 access to this information for 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.870
 many years he became the spokesman for 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.790
 the military of the cosmonauts of the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.740
 astronauts to talk about all of these 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.870
 secrets and good there we have you I turn to 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.270
 repeat the little one and we see it but 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.370
 already after in these images is when 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.570
 I began to see and this is no longer a 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.220
 hey 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.990
 there is the space station 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.510
 international in the distance and look what 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.250
 they are of the size they concern me two things 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.080
 let's hope that because you do not know 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.160
 publicly and to whom it is convenient 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.470
 who does not suit you 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.110
 some put obstacles for not 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.420
 seer imagine you we knew that 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.760
 there is a technology that generates this for 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.180
 start where on earth in what hangar 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.670
 on earth and two if this technology does not 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.380
 it is terrestrial who is capable of doing 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.830
 this is obviously much more powerful 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.830
 that we 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.680
 It's a little bit because it's going to land 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.050
 Guatemala is like thinking you're coming 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.940
 the world over and I hope is precisely 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.580
 I believe the fear that it would cause in all 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.560
 us and that way they try to 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.390
 hide it because they say it in a way 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.380
 very clear and it will be a safety issue 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.490
 national 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.020
 here in national security and the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.790
 global security it is clear that 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.740
 we are talking about a process in the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.750
 which we do not understand 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.660
 we just do not understand 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.090
 we imagine what it is that they have 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.770
 found in those flying objects there 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.050
 identified so big what 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.540
 properties have some material that 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.520
 we know in a girlfriend we loved it 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.650
 because they do not have them although what they do 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.129
 that they have found rather that they have 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.899
 could observe are their peculiarities 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.610
 the fact of being able to suspend without 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:29.110
 flight wake is to say as a 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.360
 helicopter you arrive and they refer and 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.239
 they just disappear these things like this 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.979
 occur without noise without noise for 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:38.349
 next I hope you can have the 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.729
 material that happened in Russia was 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.080
 many years but has just returned 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.589
 occurred a locality is called by 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.989
 today is in morgues a UFO literally 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.729
 so one so big but openly 

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:50.619
 was presented to the children of a 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.659
 school as well as in South Africa 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:54.489
 parallel cases and everyone saw it what 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.110
 they could draw and there were even cases of 

00:05:54.489 --> 00:06:00.990
 what we call abductions kidnappings 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.990
 aliens have recorded 

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:09.369
 then remember that this end of 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.259
 week we have many events go 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.939
 alternative space tv point let's go to 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.539
 to be in Ciudad Juarez that I had 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.249
 order 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.169
 there is a free conference on that 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.659
 theme of extraterrestrial archeology 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.939
 so go, it 's in Ciudad Juarez, so 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.529
 of month and there we will also have this 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.849
 seminar those seminars on the 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.949
 contact is to try is someone asked me 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.390
 techniques to contact and everything there 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.660
 we will have for all 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.860
 from the gender therapies and the because 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.780
 here in Mexico City we are going to have 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.000
 many surprises of the next goals 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.460
 thank you thank you thank you 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.950
 very good in that we are going to
