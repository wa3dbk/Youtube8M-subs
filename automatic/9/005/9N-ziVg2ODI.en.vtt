00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.200
 how about friends tortugueros today I come 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:10.990
 to talk to you about a very species 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.900
 beautiful that 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.860
 what is the power in emission and filis the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.029
 I could 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.760
 after time I could acquire it and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.070
 this 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.150
 and then look are the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.150
 I show it to you 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.289
 it is this beautiful 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:41.870
 also its beautiful color in the shell 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.810
 his face his orange tones that I 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.000
 they fascinate 18 their skin is gray to 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.100
 comparison of the others but all as 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.070
 is the red ear also its 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.520
 shades of the plastron are being 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.750
 like coffees and sometimes they 're both reddish 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.590
 roses 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.930
 its faithful gray legs totally hard 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.030
 these little lists that you see here 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.000
 they are very very nice 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.210
 is 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.940
 You can buy it for a partner who 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.690
 it's called gerzain I appreciate it a lot 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.120
 that is, let 's start the morphology of this 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.420
 turtle its shell as you can see 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.510
 here is this you can notice black brown 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.300
 obscure adults but in exemplary 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.330
 juveniles can acquire brown tones 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.670
 or greenish are green 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.260
 as I will tell you an olive green that looks 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.590
 same very nice in this kind of 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.750
 turtles 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.960
 this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.020
 he plastron that is being colored 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.200
 gray gray gray parchment light gray without stains 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.689
 all this that you see here 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.549
 this legs are grayish without 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.350
 spots or stripes as it's just show 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.869
 Now he did the favor of removing the little foot 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.360
 to the turtle to be able to 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.860
 they taught in the east the head the head 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 of its dark with some spots of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.569
 Intense yellow color is what 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.800
 particular I like I like it very much 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.110
 this color that is made to them but in the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.470
 adults are losing the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.120
 characteristics for the same reason that 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.269
 growth and all that but 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.940
 there is a type of food that is 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.220
 can give you that you have beta carotene that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.180
 that helps them by the color of those 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.430
 little spots on the turtle 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.829
 called mong reptile is the one that I have occupied 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.849
 for some red emitters and the 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.890
 colors of his ears are going changing 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.350
 considerably doing with the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.180
 pretty orange and this 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.790
 those who would most put their uniforms 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.460
 Sexually, the females reach a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.620
 larger size like most of the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.600
 turtles and they have the shortest tail and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.530
 narrow 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.459
 and this 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.860
 good according to a character called 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.470
 field I think it's called the females 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.170
 they have black eyes and males and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.800
 juveniles have them green as well 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.910
 how is it with this little 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.910
 could minis 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.210
 his eyes are green 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.400
 you can notice it 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.980
 and this good this is what this says 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.440
 character about this little species 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.680
 its habitat this kind of sight 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.380
 basically in the rivers and their basins of 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.420
 but look for example you're 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.280
 they inhabit the rivers of the Orinoco and 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.380
 Amazon 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.100
 and all its tributaries therefore it 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.980
 You may find that you have 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.470
 venezuela colombia in ecuador perÃº 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.530
 Bolivia and especially in Brazil in Brazil 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.569
 It is well known that the species 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.540
 feeding this is a very kind 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.650
 this herbivore already when it is big but 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.500
 is omnivorous juvenile and smaller to 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.000
 juveniles stands out for the food 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.830
 of animal origin as they can be 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.480
 Charales and this to the adults as well as 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.010
 I'm mentioning them because I prefer the 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.770
 Vegetables such as aquatic plants 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.680
 this one I could tell you the carrot 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.690
 the carrot as it has 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.490
 highlight or you can leave us too 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.039
 for their color instead of giving them the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.639
 food that I tell you but the food 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:49.470
 comes more more balanced with more things 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.580
 this 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.010
 your behavior are especially this 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.420
 species in particular is somewhat shy as 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.210
 they could see it in all the time 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.490
 that I have here with the turtle has not 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.650
 gone out more than once is still 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.320
 shy but they adapt well to the 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.690
 captivity this is not about a 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.760
 aggressive species like the lizard or the 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.130
 alligator the pigeon that is also very 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.130
 aggressive the soft shell but 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.720
 but it is not advisable to put together 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.200
 too many copies for good you have 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.390
 the size and everything to be able to have them in 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.710
 optimal conditions and it would be something 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.050
 very feasible 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.230
 it is common to see the breaths on logs and 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.230
 rocks and right now I'm processing your 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.740
 for its dry zone because nothing else 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:48.320
 remember that they are semiaquatic not 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:53.120
 totally aquatic and these turtles do not 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.580
 they do lethargy, that is, not 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.810
 hibernate therefore should 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.960
 keep all the year this then consumption 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.850
 your thermostat and 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.410
 and what is right for them about 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.410
 28 to 26 degrees 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.220
 I say forgiveness from 28 to 30 because it can 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.780
 these tortures are not they are not 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.090
 inhabitants cold their reproduction then 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.650
 reproduction have basically 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.770
 reproduced 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.830
 many of these turtles in captivity 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.550
 the bet of this turtle goes from 10 to 35 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.550
 eggs 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.180
 are the size of the egg is 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.889
 approximately 4 to 2.5 centimeters 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.330
 It is not very big but imagine 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:49.389
 put an egg for this one in all then 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.360
 imagine the battle that must 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.509
 be it 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.310
 and then how to have turtles laying 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:00.460
 it's out of the water 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.040
 and is that the incubation temperature 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.640
 for these turtles you must haunt between 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.070
 the 28 degrees with a humidity of 90 to 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.540
 100 percent and the eggs hatch 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.240
 passing the 60 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.569
 70 days depending on how the 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.849
 successful incubation 1 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.099
 and this 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.689
 is this kind of is pretty 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.509
 persecuted in its habitat as by 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:26.639
 example in brazil as I was saying 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:30.309
 because of the house with the ends 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:34.330
 culinary or for- profit purposes such as 

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:36.529
 to sell them illegally and this to 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.409
 eat them here as 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:43.399
 as they usually do in Mexico in some 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:45.240
 species and then there is this kind of 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:46.650
 podocnemis 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.070
 is 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:53.430
 it goes there are different species subspecies 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.800
 species forgiveness species well for 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:59.940
 example protection and I expand the 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:03.960
 lightweight sixth view butt uni filis 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.699
 for this case of liters of shovel and then 

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.259
 this turtle is currently on 

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:10.889
 been feeding from these little 

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:13.800
 plants and other things well then that 

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:15.100
 It would be all already started to bark my 

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.910
 dogs 

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:21.360
 but all friends and good until the 

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.360
 next
