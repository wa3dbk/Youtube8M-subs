your level 1 hundreds Rav injure that's
I<00:05:17.820> think<00:05:18.540> that's<00:05:18.780> probably<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.980> go<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.250> one

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
I think that's probably the go to one

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.290 
I think that's probably the go to one
throw<00:05:21.420> down<00:05:21.630> your<00:05:21.660> axe<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.380> lot<00:05:22.620> of<00:05:22.770> damage

throw down your axe to a lot of damage

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.190 
throw down your axe to a lot of damage
it's<00:05:24.300> just<00:05:24.890> it's<00:05:25.890> great<00:05:26.610> for<00:05:26.880> tanking<00:05:27.300> because

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
it's just it's great for tanking because

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.140 
it's just it's great for tanking because
it<00:05:28.410> increases<00:05:28.920> your<00:05:29.280> chance<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.700> perry<00:05:29.940> buy

thirty<00:05:30.600> percent<00:05:31.250> that's<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.520> lot<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.790> percent

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
thirty percent that's a lot of percent

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.500
