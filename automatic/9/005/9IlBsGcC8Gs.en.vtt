different grommet system in it as well

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
different grommet system in it as well
this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> called<00:00:52.590> anti-friction<00:00:53.370> grommets<00:00:54.000> if

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you'll see little ridges in the grommet

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
you'll see little ridges in the grommet
holes<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.800> designed<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> keep<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
holes and that's designed to keep the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.060 
holes and that's designed to keep the
string<00:01:00.120> above<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.660> grommet<00:01:01.109> itself<00:01:01.829> and

allow<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> move<00:01:02.699> more<00:01:03.000> freely<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.890> helps

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
allow it to move more freely which helps

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
allow it to move more freely which helps
with<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.430> spin<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:05.970> power<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.390> well

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
with more spin and more power as well

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
with more spin and more power as well
the<00:01:07.290> last<00:01:07.470> feature<00:01:07.740> about<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.189> racquets
