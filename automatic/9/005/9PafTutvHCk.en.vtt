00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
the different types of handlebars and is

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.580 
the different types of handlebars and is
one<00:00:33.579> better<00:00:33.879> than<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.120> other<00:00:34.239> well<00:00:35.170> generally

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
one better than the other well generally

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.110 
one better than the other well generally
there's<00:00:35.829> three<00:00:36.010> types<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.370> handlebars<00:00:36.879> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
there's three types of handlebars and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.210 
there's three types of handlebars and
there's<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.600> multiple<00:00:38.170> variations<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.830> each<00:00:39.010> of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
there's a multiple variations of each of

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.790 
there's a multiple variations of each of
them<00:00:39.339> first<00:00:40.059> riser<00:00:40.540> bars<00:00:40.900> this<00:00:41.350> one<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.650> made

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
them first riser bars this one is made

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.259 
them first riser bars this one is made
to<00:00:41.949> keep<00:00:42.100> you<00:00:42.190> in<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.309> more<00:00:42.489> upright<00:00:42.760> position

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
to keep you in a more upright position

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.180 
to keep you in a more upright position
on<00:00:43.390> your<00:00:43.420> bicycle<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.589> also<00:00:44.710> gives<00:00:44.980> you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
on your bicycle and it also gives you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.829 
on your bicycle and it also gives you
the<00:00:45.610> opportunity<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.300> hold<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:46.629> wider

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
the opportunity to hold it wider

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.990 
the opportunity to hold it wider
therefore<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.860> have<00:00:47.980> more<00:00:48.190> control<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.940> more

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
therefore you have more control and more

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.369 
therefore you have more control and more

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
leverage on the bike when you're pulling

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.110 
leverage on the bike when you're pulling
it<00:00:50.470> up<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:50.769> down<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.760> reason<00:00:52.000> why

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
it up and down that is the reason why

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.149 
it up and down that is the reason why
they<00:00:52.239> use<00:00:52.420> these<00:00:52.659> for<00:00:52.930> BMX<00:00:53.290> bikes<00:00:53.650> for

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:00.189 
second we have the bolt horn this gives

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.950 
second we have the bolt horn this gives
you<00:01:00.280> two<00:01:00.460> riding<00:01:00.670> positions<00:01:01.269> if<00:01:01.809> you're
