into the water which keeps the barrel

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.360 
into the water which keeps the barrel
nice<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.329> clean<00:02:49.569> it's<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.859> do<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.099> change

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370

the<00:02:51.670> water<00:02:51.910> like<00:02:52.389> I<00:02:52.420> said<00:02:52.510> I've<00:02:52.780> cooked

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
the water like I said I've cooked

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.199 
the water like I said I've cooked
probably<00:02:53.680> using<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.400> hundred<00:02:54.579> hours<00:02:54.790> out<00:02:55.180> of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
probably using a hundred hours out of

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.839 
probably using a hundred hours out of
this<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.349> can<00:02:56.530> still<00:02:56.859> see<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.400> red<00:02:57.549> wine

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
this and you can still see the red wine

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.349 
this and you can still see the red wine
on<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:59.049> inside<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> barrel<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.700> it's

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
on the inside of the barrel and it's

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.710 
on the inside of the barrel and it's
very<00:03:02.109> clean

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
very clean

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.230 
very clean
all<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.290> change<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.040> water<00:03:06.690> and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
all I do is just change the water and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.580 
all I do is just change the water and
its<00:03:10.240> needs<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.660> be<00:03:10.750> changed<00:03:11.170> now<00:03:14.850> no<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:16.440> mean<00:03:17.440> I

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
its needs to be changed now no I mean I

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.090 
its needs to be changed now no I mean I
waited<00:03:18.250> about<00:03:18.340> 4<00:03:19.209> months<00:03:19.620> last<00:03:20.620> time<00:03:20.920> because

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
waited about 4 months last time because

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.760 
waited about 4 months last time because
you<00:03:21.790> know<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:21.940> was<00:03:22.540> away<00:03:25.320> mingun<00:03:26.320> when<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.590> got

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770

back but you just get a hose and you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.540 
back but you just get a hose and you
know<00:03:29.380> squirt<00:03:29.650> everything<00:03:30.040> out<00:03:30.160> because<00:03:30.280> it's

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
know squirt everything out because it's

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:39.020 
know squirt everything out because it's
all<00:03:30.700> stainless<00:03:31.060> steel<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.720> inside

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.940 

yes<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:39.930> these<00:03:40.080> will<00:03:40.320> be<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.770> market

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
yes so these will be on the market

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.150 
yes so these will be on the market
probably<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.320> next<00:03:43.400> summer<00:03:45.860> perfect<00:03:46.860> Lauri

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
probably in next summer perfect Lauri

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.090 
probably in next summer perfect Lauri
March<00:03:48.410> great<00:03:49.760> start<00:03:50.760> launching<00:03:52.100> we're

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
March great start launching we're

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.980 
March great start launching we're
building<00:03:53.460> a<00:03:53.550> flannel<00:03:53.970> prototype<00:03:54.540> right<00:03:54.810> now

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
building a flannel prototype right now

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.470 
building a flannel prototype right now
and<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.300> then<00:03:58.200> I'm<00:03:58.380> giving<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.670> a<00:04:00.120> gas

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
and and then I'm giving that to a gas

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.010 
and and then I'm giving that to a gas
but<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.780> get<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.050> certified<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.430> also<00:04:03.020> engineer

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
but I get it certified and also engineer

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.120 
but I get it certified and also engineer
to<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.290> make<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.770> little<00:04:07.920> bit

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
to just and just make it a little bit

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.990 
to just and just make it a little bit
more<00:04:08.310> efficient<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:10.550> then<00:04:11.550> we're<00:04:11.670> gonna<00:04:11.760> have

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
more efficient and then we're gonna have

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.699 
more efficient and then we're gonna have
parts<00:04:12.390> manufacturing<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:18.590> put<00:04:19.590> them

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
parts manufacturing and so we put them

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:38.030 
parts manufacturing and so we put them
on<00:04:19.829> yes<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.640> case<00:04:35.820> I'm<00:04:36.060> using<00:04:36.090> oak<00:04:37.040> so

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
on yes and in this case I'm using oak so

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.550 
on yes and in this case I'm using oak so
which<00:04:38.370> gives<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.060> real<00:04:39.330> mild<00:04:42.500> manuka<00:04:43.500> is

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
which gives you a real mild manuka is

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.450 
which gives you a real mild manuka is
probably<00:04:43.860> about<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.340> strongest<00:04:48.979> yep<00:04:49.979> in<00:04:50.310> New

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
probably about the strongest yep in New

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.730 
probably about the strongest yep in New
