00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
it wasn't until over 50 years later that

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.220 
it wasn't until over 50 years later that
something<00:00:03.060> else<00:00:03.210> was<00:00:03.449> discovered<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.049> also

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
something else was discovered that also

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.470 
something else was discovered that also
gave<00:00:04.620> out<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.009> light<00:00:05.310> but<00:00:05.730> without<00:00:05.970> such

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
gave out this light but without such

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.290 
gave out this light but without such
high<00:00:06.690> temperatures<00:00:07.820> this<00:00:08.820> was<00:00:08.970> actually

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
high temperatures this was actually

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.839 
high temperatures this was actually
discovered<00:00:09.650> accidentally<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.980> chemist<00:00:11.700> was

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
discovered accidentally a chemist was

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.459 
discovered accidentally a chemist was
heating<00:00:12.210> up<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.389> mixture<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.719> solutions<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.380> it

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
heating up a mixture of solutions and it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.910 
heating up a mixture of solutions and it
boiled<00:00:13.799> over<00:00:14.130> onto<00:00:14.700> his<00:00:14.730> gauze<00:00:15.150> okay<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
boiled over onto his gauze okay and it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.640 
boiled over onto his gauze okay and it
started<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.369> glow<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.539> Bunsen<00:00:18.900> flame<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
started to glow in the Bunsen flame and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
started to glow in the Bunsen flame and
we<00:00:19.859> use<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.430> nowadays<00:00:21.109> in<00:00:22.109> light<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:24.210> light

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
we use this nowadays in light in light

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.259 
we use this nowadays in light in light
Mantle's<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.220> camping<00:00:26.849> light

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
Mantle's here so this is a camping light

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.380 
Mantle's here so this is a camping light
we<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> source<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.769> gas<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.340> butane<00:00:29.880> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
we have a source of gas here butane this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.350 
we have a source of gas here butane this
burns<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.349> plays<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.099> mantle<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
burns and it plays on the mantle at the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
burns and it plays on the mantle at the
top<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.440> lamp<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> white

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
top of the lamp so this is the white

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
top of the lamp so this is the white
element<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> top<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
element that we see at the top there and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.639 
element that we see at the top there and
this<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> composed<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.899> rather<00:00:40.200> rare

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this is composed of some rather rare

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.639 
this is composed of some rather rare
elements<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.730> oxide<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.270> magnesium

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
elements they have oxide and magnesium

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
elements they have oxide and magnesium
lanthanum<00:00:43.649> yttrium<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.700> zirconium<00:00:45.510> okay

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
lanthanum yttrium and zirconium okay

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
lanthanum yttrium and zirconium okay
well<00:00:46.379> let's<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
well let's see if we can get one of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.200 
well let's see if we can get one of
these<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.879> work<00:00:48.059> I've<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.899> mantel<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:50.210> so

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
these to work I've got a mantel here so

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
these to work I've got a mantel here so
here<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> mantel<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> these

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
here is the the mantel from one of these

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.350 
here is the the mantel from one of these
lamps<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:55.370> just<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.460> my<00:00:56.579> Bunsen<00:00:57.000> flame<00:00:57.030> well

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
lamps and just with my Bunsen flame well

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.729 
lamps and just with my Bunsen flame well
first<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.750> let's<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.020> try<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.379> heat<00:00:58.590> up

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
first of all let's just try and heat up

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.029 
first of all let's just try and heat up
the<00:00:58.859> gauze<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:01.079> Bunsen<00:01:01.469> burner<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.890> get

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the gauze so my Bunsen burner can get

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219 
the gauze so my Bunsen burner can get
things<00:01:02.280> red<00:01:02.579> hot<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> metal<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:04.019> something

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
things red hot so a metal or something

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.170 
things red hot so a metal or something
like<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.530> close<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> only<00:01:05.519> glows<00:01:05.729> red

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like this close but it only glows red

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
like this close but it only glows red
hot<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.710> light

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
hot there's not really very much light

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.730 
hot there's not really very much light
coming<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.020> but<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.170> oxides

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
coming out of that but these oxides

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.340 
coming out of that but these oxides
these<00:01:11.640> particular<00:01:12.000> compounds<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:12.930> heated

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
these particular compounds when heated

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
these particular compounds when heated
give<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.760> brilliant<00:01:14.970> white

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
give out a really really brilliant white

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.890 
give out a really really brilliant white
light<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.210> at

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
light here so this is much better at

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
light here so this is much better at
converting<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.770> heat<00:01:19.950> energy<00:01:20.130> into<00:01:20.549> light

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
converting the heat energy into light

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
converting the heat energy into light
but<00:01:21.780> only<00:01:21.810> certain<00:01:22.290> compounds<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.280> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
but only certain compounds will do this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.950 
but only certain compounds will do this
so<00:01:25.040> let's<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:27.030> find<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.900> our

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so let's see if we can find these on our

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.520 
so let's see if we can find these on our
periodic<00:01:28.890> table<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> where<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.350> we

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
periodic table then so where are we we

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.749 
periodic table then so where are we we
have<00:01:31.740> atrium<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.450> iron<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.869> reom<00:01:34.189> very<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
have atrium if iron it reom very good it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
have atrium if iron it reom very good it
rooms<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> Y<00:01:36.390> Zucco<00:01:37.350> Neum<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:38.369> quite<00:01:38.640> easy

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
rooms the Y Zucco Neum that's quite easy

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.410 
rooms the Y Zucco Neum that's quite easy
that's<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.720> next<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> lanthanum<00:01:41.420> very

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that's the one next to it lanthanum very

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.440 
that's the one next to it lanthanum very
good<00:01:42.689> down<00:01:43.110> here

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
good down here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
good down here
after<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> while<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.020> found<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.380> was

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
after a while it was found there was

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
after a while it was found there was
another<00:01:46.740> element<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.280> worked<00:01:47.460> even<00:01:47.759> better

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
another element that worked even better

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
another element that worked even better
than<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:48.810> ones<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.920> used<00:01:50.100> for

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
than these ones and this was used for

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
than these ones and this was used for
quite<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> long<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.299> element<00:01:51.689> this

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
quite a long time and this element this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.440 
quite a long time and this element this
thorium<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> perhaps<00:01:53.280> find<00:01:53.610> thorium<00:01:54.180> for

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
thorium can you perhaps find thorium for

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
thorium can you perhaps find thorium for

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.969 
very good
so<00:01:56.969> there's<00:01:57.210> thorium<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.049> thorium<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> just

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
so there's thorium but thorium is just

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
so there's thorium but thorium is just
two<00:01:59.310> spaces<00:01:59.850> away<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> periodic<00:02:01.380> table

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
two spaces away in the periodic table

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.810 
two spaces away in the periodic table
from<00:02:02.180> uranium<00:02:03.680> okay<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.130> uranium

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
from uranium okay here is uranium

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.680 
from uranium okay here is uranium
okay<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.409> thorium<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.310> uranium<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.149> also

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
okay so thorium like uranium is also

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.699 
okay so thorium like uranium is also
slightly<00:02:10.259> radioactive<00:02:11.569> well<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:13.110> here

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
slightly radioactive well I have here

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.789 
slightly radioactive well I have here
an<00:02:14.489> original<00:02:14.870> mantel<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.409> early

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
an original mantel one of the early

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.530 
an original mantel one of the early
types<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.340> still<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.640> its<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:17.969> plastic<00:02:18.390> bag

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
types is still in its little plastic bag

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.839 
types is still in its little plastic bag
we<00:02:18.719> bought<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.079> fairly<00:02:19.349> recently<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:20.730> one

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
we bought this fairly recently the one

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.699 
we bought this fairly recently the one
that<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:21.329> in<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.989> lamp<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.379> actually<00:02:22.650> a

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that we have in the lamp is actually a

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.789 
that we have in the lamp is actually a
modern<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.159> made<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.390> these<00:02:25.290> are<00:02:25.439> other

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
modern one made of the these are other

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.059 
modern one made of the these are other
elements<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.700> trims<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.299> cone<00:02:27.480> ium<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:27.930> on

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
elements it trims a cone ium and so on

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.860 
elements it trims a cone ium and so on
but<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.189> one<00:02:29.250> does<00:02:29.969> in<00:02:30.180> fact<00:02:30.420> contain

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
but this one does in fact contain

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.140 
but this one does in fact contain
thorium<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.489> should<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.790> able<00:02:32.879> to<00:02:33.000> see

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
thorium and we should be able to see

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.339 
thorium and we should be able to see
that<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.329> is<00:02:33.450> radioactive<00:02:33.750> now<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.109> need<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
that this is radioactive now I need to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.420 
that this is radioactive now I need to
just<00:02:34.469> get<00:02:34.560> down<00:02:34.739> here<00:02:34.859> so<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.069> can<00:02:35.219> hear<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
just get down here so you can hear the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.539 
just get down here so you can hear the
clicks<00:02:35.730> from<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.060> Geiger<00:02:36.450> counter<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:40.549> even

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
clicks from the Geiger counter so even

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.270 
clicks from the Geiger counter so even
though<00:02:41.639> it's<00:02:41.760> still<00:02:41.969> in<00:02:42.090> its<00:02:42.209> pocket<00:02:42.689> here<00:02:43.280> you

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
though it's still in its pocket here you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.990 
though it's still in its pocket here you
can<00:02:44.430> hear<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.639> it<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.909> not<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.329> radioactive<00:02:47.000> so

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
can hear that it is not a radioactive so

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.259 
can hear that it is not a radioactive so
I'll<00:02:48.510> put<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.019> one<00:02:49.079> back<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.739> my<00:02:50.269> radiation

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
I'll put that one back in my radiation

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.360 
I'll put that one back in my radiation
proof<00:02:51.720> box<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.409> think<00:02:53.689> there<00:02:54.689> we<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.250> no

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
proof box I think there we are so we no

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.459 
proof box I think there we are so we no
longer<00:02:56.400> use<00:02:56.760> thorium<00:02:57.659> even<00:02:58.260> though<00:02:58.349> it's

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
longer use thorium even though it's

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.199 
longer use thorium even though it's
actually<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.859> best<00:02:59.129> at<00:02:59.340> converting<00:02:59.730> heat

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
actually the best at converting heat

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.569 
actually the best at converting heat
into<00:03:00.629> light<00:03:00.810> better<00:03:01.409> than<00:03:01.620> any<00:03:01.739> other<00:03:02.010> oxide

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
into light better than any other oxide

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.649 
into light better than any other oxide
okay

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
okay

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.179 
okay
thorium<00:03:04.230> oxide<00:03:04.409> actually<00:03:04.950> has<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.159> highest

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
thorium oxide actually has the highest

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.789 
thorium oxide actually has the highest
melting<00:03:05.639> point<00:03:05.909> of<00:03:06.209> all<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.629> oxides<00:03:07.049> and

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
melting point of all of the oxides and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.349 
melting point of all of the oxides and
is<00:03:07.950> very<00:03:08.189> good<00:03:08.459> for<00:03:08.579> converting<00:03:09.060> heat<00:03:09.239> to

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
is very good for converting heat to

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.030 
is very good for converting heat to
light<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.109> say<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.439> abandoned<00:03:10.950> now

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
light but I say it's abandoned now

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.450 
light but I say it's abandoned now
because<00:03:11.579> it's<00:03:12.030> radioactive
