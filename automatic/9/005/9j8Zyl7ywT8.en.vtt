that some not all threads in your bobbin
work<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:47.510> not<00:00:47.780> all<00:00:47.960> batting's<00:00:48.500> work<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.310> is<00:00:49.430> a

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
work and not all batting's work but is a

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.220 
work and not all batting's work but is a
manipulated<00:00:50.210> stitch<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.690> you<00:00:50.780> will<00:00:50.930> have<00:00:51.140> to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
manipulated stitch and you will have to

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.690 
manipulated stitch and you will have to
kind<00:00:51.410> of<00:00:51.440> work<00:00:51.590> with<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.160> find<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:52.579> works

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
kind of work with it to find what works

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.510 
kind of work with it to find what works
for<00:00:52.880> you<00:00:53.180> next<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.260> do<00:00:54.680> tighten<00:00:55.130> our<00:00:55.250> top

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
for you next we do tighten our top

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.160 
for you next we do tighten our top
tension<00:00:55.970> I'm<00:00:56.059> gonna<00:00:56.180> take<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.510> all<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.720> way<00:00:56.899> up

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
tension I'm gonna take it all the way up

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.950 
tension I'm gonna take it all the way up
to<00:00:57.380> 8<00:00:57.649> or<00:00:57.680> 9<00:00:58.040> just<00:00:58.880> to<00:00:59.090> get<00:00:59.360> me<00:00:59.510> into<00:00:59.840> the

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
to 8 or 9 just to get me into the

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.690 
to 8 or 9 just to get me into the
ballpark<00:01:00.200> I'm<00:01:00.710> gonna<00:01:01.040> start<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.489> stitch

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
ballpark I'm gonna start to stitch

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.090 
ballpark I'm gonna start to stitch
because<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.180> stitch<00:01:02.420> has<00:01:02.660> a<00:01:02.690> sequence<00:01:03.110> you

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
because the stitch has a sequence you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.590 
because the stitch has a sequence you
also<00:01:04.189> -<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.759> doesn't<00:01:05.059> look<00:01:05.149> like<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.449> does

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
also - it doesn't look like it does

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.360 
also - it doesn't look like it does
anything<00:01:05.870> for<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.320> first<00:01:06.560> couple<00:01:06.770> stitches

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
anything for the first couple stitches

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.010 
anything for the first couple stitches
but<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:07.880> it<00:01:08.150> has<00:01:08.360> kind<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.630> like<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> little

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
but it's it has kind of like a little

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.440 
but it's it has kind of like a little
bit<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.470> delay<00:01:09.860> but<00:01:10.640> what<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:10.880> does<00:01:11.120> is<00:01:11.330> it

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
bit of a delay but what it does is it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.719 
bit of a delay but what it does is it
takes<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.840> stitch<00:01:12.080> forward<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.100> stitch<00:01:13.370> back

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
takes a stitch forward and a stitch back

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.810 
takes a stitch forward and a stitch back
but<00:01:14.090> when<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.330> comes<00:01:14.600> backwards<00:01:15.010> its<00:01:16.010> dragging

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
but when it comes backwards its dragging

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.730 
but when it comes backwards its dragging
the<00:01:17.000> bobbin<00:01:17.540> thread<00:01:17.570> up<00:01:17.810> that's<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.409> color

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
the bobbin thread up that's the color

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.320 
the bobbin thread up that's the color
that<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.159> want<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.580> do<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.850> then<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.119> kind

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
that you want it to do and then it kind

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.200 
that you want it to do and then it kind
of<00:01:20.390> tacks<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:21.140> in<00:01:21.380> place<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.400> then<00:01:22.760> stitches

of tacks it in place and then stitches

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.090

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
for we're leaving a little blank

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.640

well<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.520> stitch<00:01:25.760> forward<00:01:26.270> where<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.020> empty

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
well the stitch forward where it's empty

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.580 
well the stitch forward where it's empty
it's<00:01:27.979> where<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.340> clear<00:01:28.729> thread<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.590> stitching

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's where the clear thread is stitching

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.380 
it's where the clear thread is stitching
but<00:01:31.010> you<00:01:31.189> just<00:01:31.400> can't<00:01:31.670> see<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:32.180> most

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
but you just can't see it on most

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.410 
but you just can't see it on most
fabrics<00:01:33.049> now<00:01:33.890> as<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.460> start<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.909> work<00:01:35.060> around

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
fabrics now as you start to work around

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.600 
fabrics now as you start to work around
another<00:01:36.350> thing<00:01:36.619> too<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:36.950> using<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.369> walking

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
another thing too is using a walking

foot with with this stitch works

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.990 
foot with with this stitch works
beautifully<00:01:40.070> because<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:40.430> your<00:01:40.580> fabrics

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
beautifully because then your fabrics

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.600 
beautifully because then your fabrics
don't<00:01:41.210> move<00:01:41.930> around<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:43.070> for<00:01:43.250> today<00:01:43.490> I'm

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
don't move around but just for today I'm

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.789 
don't move around but just for today I'm
having<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.119> open<00:01:44.240> toe<00:01:44.630> foot<00:01:44.930> if<00:01:45.560> you're

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
having the open toe foot if you're

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.620 
having the open toe foot if you're
stitching<00:01:46.159> or<00:01:46.549> you're<00:01:46.640> following<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.180> line<00:01:47.390> you

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
stitching or you're following a line you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.240 
stitching or you're following a line you
could<00:01:47.810> go<00:01:47.900> ahead<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.290> do<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:48.470> if<00:01:48.890> you're

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
could go ahead and do that if you're

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.130 
could go ahead and do that if you're
turning<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.759> corner<00:01:50.060> though<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.479> do<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:50.810> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
turning a corner though you do have to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.260 
turning a corner though you do have to
find<00:01:51.380> where<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> sequence<00:01:52.790> would<00:01:52.970> be<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
find where in the sequence would be the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.120 
find where in the sequence would be the
best<00:01:53.479> place<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:54.020> turn<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.470> corner<00:01:54.650> I'll<00:01:54.920> stop

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
best place to turn a corner I'll stop

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.420 
best place to turn a corner I'll stop
with<00:01:55.310> my<00:01:55.430> needle<00:01:55.640> down<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.500> then<00:01:57.500> turn<00:01:58.130> you

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
with my needle down and then turn you

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.190 
with my needle down and then turn you
can<00:01:58.610> start<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.000> see<00:01:59.240> how<00:01:59.450> pretty<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
can start to see how pretty that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.770 
can start to see how pretty that
stitching<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:01.100> now<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.150> back<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.600> going

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
stitching is now on the back it is going

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.480 
stitching is now on the back it is going
to<00:02:02.900> look<00:02:03.049> like<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.259> solid<00:02:03.770> line<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.070> stitching

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
to look like a solid line of stitching

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.490 
to look like a solid line of stitching
and<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.360> going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.659> show<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:05.930> that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
and so it is going to show you that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.199 
and so it is going to show you that
you're<00:02:06.860> not<00:02:06.950> really<00:02:07.250> doing<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.520> by<00:02:07.700> hand<00:02:08.000> but

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
you're not really doing it by hand but

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.300 
you're not really doing it by hand but
boy<00:02:08.420> for<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> quick<00:02:09.049> look<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.979> know<00:02:10.009> those

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
boy for a quick look and you know those

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.470 
boy for a quick look and you know those
projects<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:11.120> kind<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.450> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
projects that just kind of have that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.000 
projects that just kind of have that
primitive<00:02:11.840> look<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.770> wanted

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
primitive look that you kind of wanted

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.040 
primitive look that you kind of wanted
to<00:02:13.099> have<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.520> hand<00:02:13.849> look<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.270> it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
to have that hand look to it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.110 
to have that hand look to it
is<00:02:15.140> great<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.800> also<00:02:16.280> adjust<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.820> stitch

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
is great you can also adjust the stitch

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.060 
is great you can also adjust the stitch
length<00:02:17.150> did<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.200> wish<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.350> make<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.800> longer

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
length did you wish to make that longer

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.640 
length did you wish to make that longer
or<00:02:19.280> shorter<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.480> where<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.840> want<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.110> turn<00:02:21.380> is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
or shorter so where you want to turn is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.100 
or shorter so where you want to turn is
when<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.100> stitch<00:02:22.490> comes<00:02:22.850> forward<00:02:23.240> after<00:02:23.960> it's

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
when the stitch comes forward after it's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.230 
when the stitch comes forward after it's
dragging<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.800> bobbin<00:02:25.160> thread<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.580> or<00:02:25.970> right

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
dragging the bobbin thread up or right

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240 
dragging the bobbin thread up or right
before<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.780> starts<00:02:27.170> one<00:02:27.380> more<00:02:27.620> step<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.190> you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
before it starts one more step so you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.370 
before it starts one more step so you
kind<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.850> get<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.690> rhythm<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
kind of have to get the rhythm of the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.140 
kind of have to get the rhythm of the
stitch<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.130> you'll<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.520> kind<00:02:31.880> of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
stitch and then you'll know kind of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.300 
stitch and then you'll know kind of
where<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:32.840> your<00:02:33.050> turning<00:02:33.530> if<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.160> not

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
where to do your turning if it's not

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.250 
where to do your turning if it's not
pulling<00:02:34.640> up<00:02:34.820> as<00:02:35.000> much<00:02:35.330> go<00:02:35.600> ahead<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.900> crank

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
pulling up as much go ahead and crank

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.590 
pulling up as much go ahead and crank
your<00:02:36.410> tension<00:02:36.770> up<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.040> little<00:02:37.310> bit<00:02:37.520> more<00:02:37.700> I'll

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
your tension up a little bit more I'll

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.140 
your tension up a little bit more I'll
tell<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.870> I'm<00:02:38.930> gonna<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.290> here<00:02:39.500> yes<00:02:40.370> just<00:02:40.700> it's

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
tell you I'm gonna do here yes just it's

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.820 
tell you I'm gonna do here yes just it's
like<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.570> pulls<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.990> up<00:02:42.110> just<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.440> little<00:02:42.470> bit

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
like it pulls it up just a little bit

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.100 
like it pulls it up just a little bit
further<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.610> then<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:44.660> go<00:02:44.780> ahead<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
further and then you can go ahead and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.710 
further and then you can go ahead and
stitch<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.680> usually<00:02:46.610> once<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:46.970> get<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.180> I'll

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
stitch I usually once I get going I'll

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.080 
stitch I usually once I get going I'll
stitch<00:02:48.110> full-speed<00:02:48.680> when<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.700> have<00:02:49.880> good

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
stitch full-speed when you have good

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.760 
quality clear thread and your needles
correct<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:54.020> really<00:02:54.290> don't<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.680> take

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
correct you really don't have to take

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.280 
correct you really don't have to take
any<00:02:55.100> extra<00:02:55.460> precautions<00:02:56.180> for<00:02:56.300> pitching

any extra precautions for pitching

any extra precautions for pitching
slower<00:02:58.070> anything<00:02:59.170> but<00:03:00.170> that's<00:03:00.890> real<00:03:01.130> look

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
slower anything but that's real look

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.060

like<00:03:01.460> on<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> front<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.740> will<00:03:03.980> be

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
like on the front and then this will be

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.150 
like on the front and then this will be
what<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.310> looks<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.880> back
