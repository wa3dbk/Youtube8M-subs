good<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:36.050> my<00:00:37.050> pump<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> little<00:00:38.370> too

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
good but my pump was just a little too

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.400

strong<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> kept<00:00:39.420> overflowing<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.230> had

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
strong and kept overflowing and I had

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.139 
strong and kept overflowing and I had
problems<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:43.610> there's<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> aquarium

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
problems with it so there's the aquarium

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.700 
problems with it so there's the aquarium
with<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> fish<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.500> murky

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
with the fish and it's a little murky

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
with the fish and it's a little murky
because<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.640> wasn't<00:00:48.180> getting<00:00:48.420> good<00:00:48.719> filtration

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because I wasn't getting good filtration

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.010 
because I wasn't getting good filtration
with<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> shelf<00:00:50.010> bombing<00:00:50.399> system<00:00:50.930> kind<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
with the shelf bombing system kind of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
with the shelf bombing system kind of
got<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> floating<00:00:54.329> bed

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
got this kind of take on a floating bed

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
got this kind of take on a floating bed
where<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> put<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> plants<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> survived

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
where I put the plants that is survived

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.130 
where I put the plants that is survived
in<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:58.219> okay<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.600> sure<00:01:00.899> what

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in there okay I'm not really sure what

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
in there okay I'm not really sure what
they<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.350> there's<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.460> sort<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.789> herbs<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.219 
they are there's some sort of herbs and
I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.040> wispy<00:01:05.369> ones

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
I think some of those little wispy ones

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.800 
I think some of those little wispy ones
leaf<00:01:07.229> lettuce<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.070> heck<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.830> so

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
leaf lettuce but a heck I don't know so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
leaf lettuce but a heck I don't know so
I've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.229> other<00:01:15.890> aquarium<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.700> want

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
I've got this other aquarium and I want

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
I've got this other aquarium and I want
to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.150> same<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.290> they've<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.530> over<00:01:19.590> here

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to do same thing they've got over here

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
to do same thing they've got over here
and<00:01:20.159> basically<00:01:21.090> I've<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> those

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and basically I've just got one of those

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.390 
and basically I've just got one of those
aquarium<00:01:22.590> pumps<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.070> come<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:24.049> into<00:01:25.049> there

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
aquarium pumps that come up into there

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
aquarium pumps that come up into there
and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.540> flows<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> way<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and then it flows all the way around and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.230 
and then it flows all the way around and
back<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.439> then<00:01:31.439> dumps<00:01:31.890> back<00:01:32.549> down<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
back down and then dumps back down and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.469 
back down and then dumps back down and
it<00:01:33.960> comes<00:01:34.530> into<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.000> flows<00:01:36.240> out

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it comes into this with some flows out

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
it comes into this with some flows out
the<00:01:36.630> side<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:40.140> clearing<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.770> little

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the side so it's clearing up a little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.389 
the side so it's clearing up a little
bit<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.460> extremely<00:01:42.119> murky<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> did<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
bit that was extremely murky but I did a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.889 
bit that was extremely murky but I did a
couple<00:01:44.640> things<00:01:44.939> number<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.540> I've<00:01:45.780> been

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
couple things number one I've been

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.359 
couple things number one I've been
pulling<00:01:46.369> water<00:01:47.369> out<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> jar<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
pulling water out with this jar and

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.870 
pulling water out with this jar and
putting<00:01:50.369> into<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:53.299> box<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.549> I've<00:01:56.549> also

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
putting into my box here but I've also

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600 
putting into my box here but I've also
it's<00:01:57.719> also<00:01:57.990> been<00:01:58.380> pumping<00:01:58.770> through<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
it's also been pumping through here and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.429 
it's also been pumping through here and
it's<00:02:00.240> been<00:02:00.390> filtering<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.200> bit

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it's been filtering out a little bit

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.490 
it's been filtering out a little bit
hopefully<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.700> will<00:02:02.880> um<00:02:03.210> it'll<00:02:04.020> continue<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
hopefully it will um it'll continue to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
hopefully it will um it'll continue to
get<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:04.860> cleaner<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:06.479> I'll<00:02:06.750> just

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
get a little cleaner if not I'll just

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
get a little cleaner if not I'll just
continue<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.680> pour<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.550> bit<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
continue to pour it out a little bit and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
continue to pour it out a little bit and
replace<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> coordinator<00:02:10.470> or

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
replace it with a coordinator or

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.209 
replace it with a coordinator or
dechlorinated<00:02:11.489> water

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.219 
dechlorinated water

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.910 
dechlorinated water
and<00:02:13.219> in<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.700> one<00:02:14.209> I've<00:02:14.900> been<00:02:15.200> putting<00:02:15.469> just<00:02:15.709> a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
and in this one I've been putting just a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.330 
and in this one I've been putting just a
little<00:02:16.219> bit<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.519> water<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.939> here<00:02:17.150> to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
little bit of the water in here to

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.420 
little bit of the water in here to
partly<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.549> start<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.920> bacterial<00:02:21.920> process

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
partly to start the bacterial process

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.039 
partly to start the bacterial process
that<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.879> still<00:02:23.180> don't<00:02:23.359> move<00:02:23.450> very<00:02:23.510> much<00:02:23.719> about

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
that I still don't move very much about

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.530 
that I still don't move very much about
but<00:02:24.260> also<00:02:24.409> because<00:02:24.950> I've<00:02:25.670> got<00:02:25.879> some<00:02:26.090> duck<00:02:26.299> weed

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
but also because I've got some duck weed

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.089 
but also because I've got some duck weed
right<00:02:27.230> here<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.389> local<00:02:29.810> aquarium<00:02:30.590> store

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
right here that the local aquarium store

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.190 
right here that the local aquarium store
was<00:02:31.549> kind<00:02:31.819> enough<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.090> let<00:02:32.359> me<00:02:32.389> dip<00:02:32.750> out<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.079> one

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
was kind enough to let me dip out of one

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.520 
was kind enough to let me dip out of one
of<00:02:33.230> their<00:02:33.409> outdoor<00:02:33.769> ponds<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.109> only<00:02:36.109> had<00:02:36.290> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
of their outdoor ponds and only had just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.069 
of their outdoor ponds and only had just
a<00:02:36.650> little<00:02:37.010> bit<00:02:37.159> but<00:02:37.969> it's<00:02:38.150> been<00:02:38.389> growing<00:02:38.900> and

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
a little bit but it's been growing and

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.369 
a little bit but it's been growing and
hopefully<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.819> will<00:02:41.120> cover<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.930> whole<00:02:42.139> thing

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
hopefully it will cover this whole thing

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.099 
hopefully it will cover this whole thing
because<00:02:42.799> I've<00:02:43.609> been<00:02:43.819> looking<00:02:44.299> into<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.689> and

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
because I've been looking into it and

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.539 
because I've been looking into it and
people<00:02:45.470> talk<00:02:45.829> about<00:02:46.010> feeding<00:02:46.400> tilapia<00:02:47.299> with

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
people talk about feeding tilapia with

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.000 
people talk about feeding tilapia with
duck<00:02:49.549> weed<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.840> I've<00:02:51.319> also<00:02:51.530> done<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.889> little

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
duck weed but I've also done a little

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.909 
duck weed but I've also done a little
bit<00:02:52.159> of<00:02:52.280> research<00:02:52.519> I've<00:02:52.819> seen<00:02:53.000> people<00:02:53.419> use<00:02:53.629> it

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
bit of research I've seen people use it

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:59.229 
bit of research I've seen people use it
dried<00:02:54.919> in<00:02:57.250> poultry<00:02:58.250> feed<00:02:58.430> chicken<00:02:58.909> feed<00:02:59.090> and

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
dried in poultry feed chicken feed and

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.599 
dried in poultry feed chicken feed and
also<00:03:01.810> I'm<00:03:02.810> gonna<00:03:02.989> try<00:03:03.139> for<00:03:03.200> apathy<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.400> if<00:03:04.519> I

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
also I'm gonna try for apathy so if I

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.759 
also I'm gonna try for apathy so if I
get<00:03:04.760> enough<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.299> dehydrate<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.959> maybe<00:03:06.230> put

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
get enough of it dehydrate it maybe put

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.949 
get enough of it dehydrate it maybe put
about<00:03:07.480> 25%<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.510> their<00:03:08.719> rations<00:03:09.969> and<00:03:10.969> we'll

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
about 25% to their rations and we'll

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.909 
about 25% to their rations and we'll
show<00:03:12.139> you<00:03:12.169> our<00:03:12.469> little<00:03:12.680> peppers<00:03:13.419> here<00:03:14.919> and

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
show you our little peppers here and

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.339 
show you our little peppers here and
basically<00:03:16.459> all<00:03:16.699> these<00:03:16.909> are<00:03:17.120> are<00:03:17.419> a<00:03:17.479> hole<00:03:17.900> cut

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
basically all these are are a hole cut

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.699 
basically all these are are a hole cut
in<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.760> pipe<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.090> then<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.870> took<00:03:20.930> us<00:03:21.260> out<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:21.650> an

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
in the pipe and then I took us out or an

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.069 
in the pipe and then I took us out or an
iron<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:22.940> punch<00:03:23.150> some<00:03:23.359> holes<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.989> that

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
iron and just punch some holes and that

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.099 
iron and just punch some holes and that
fits<00:03:24.349> in<00:03:25.479> it's<00:03:26.479> probably<00:03:26.810> not<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.959> best

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
fits in it's probably not the best

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.189 
fits in it's probably not the best
system<00:03:27.949> but<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:28.939> works<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.299> little<00:03:29.449> better<00:03:29.659> so

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
system but it works a little better so

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:34.780 
system but it works a little better so
far<00:03:30.500> than<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.400> Shelf<00:03:31.669> ponics<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:33.790> hopefully

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
far than the Shelf ponics and hopefully

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.460 
far than the Shelf ponics and hopefully
our<00:03:34.939> little<00:03:35.180> scraggly<00:03:35.510> little<00:03:35.959> beans<00:03:36.169> will

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
our little scraggly little beans will

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.219 
our little scraggly little beans will
come<00:03:36.680> back<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:37.069> life<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.790> we'll<00:03:38.750> see<00:03:38.959> how<00:03:39.169> that

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
come back to life and we'll see how that

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:40.409 
come back to life and we'll see how that
works

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
works

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.749 
works
anyway<00:03:41.419> that's<00:03:42.049> really<00:03:42.379> all<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.560> got<00:03:42.859> if<00:03:43.129> this

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:43.759 
anyway that's really all I got if this

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.520 
anyway that's really all I got if this
works<00:03:44.030> we're<00:03:44.269> gonna<00:03:44.359> go<00:03:44.629> to<00:03:44.689> up<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:44.989> even

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
works we're gonna go to up to even

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.149 
works we're gonna go to up to even
bigger<00:03:45.799> scale<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:47.590> probably<00:03:48.590> put<00:03:48.739> this<00:03:48.889> same

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
bigger scale and probably put this same

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.589 
bigger scale and probably put this same
setup<00:03:49.489> on<00:03:49.819> some<00:03:50.479> of<00:03:50.569> these<00:03:50.659> other<00:03:50.720> shelves<00:03:51.259> and

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
setup on some of these other shelves and

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.360 
setup on some of these other shelves and
maybe<00:03:53.599> get<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> 50<00:03:54.409> gallon<00:03:54.560> bucket<00:03:55.069> with<00:03:55.189> some

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
maybe get a 50 gallon bucket with some

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.610 
maybe get a 50 gallon bucket with some
tilapia<00:03:55.639> I'm<00:03:56.569> still<00:03:56.810> trying<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.079> find<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.409> good

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
tilapia I'm still trying to find a good

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460 
tilapia I'm still trying to find a good
source<00:03:57.829> for<00:03:58.009> tilapia<00:03:58.579> fry<00:03:58.909> but<00:03:59.599> anyway<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.169> just

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
source for tilapia fry but anyway I just

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.929 
source for tilapia fry but anyway I just
wanted<00:04:00.889> to<00:04:01.009> show<00:04:01.159> you<00:04:01.250> what<00:04:01.400> we<00:04:01.489> were<00:04:01.639> doing

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
wanted to show you what we were doing

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.059 
wanted to show you what we were doing
and<00:04:02.090> until<00:04:03.079> next<00:04:03.229> time<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.620> can<00:04:03.739> always<00:04:03.889> catch

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
and until next time you can always catch
