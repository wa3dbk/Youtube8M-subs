00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
very simple one okay because we don't
have<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.030> lot<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:24.979> one<00:01:25.979> bath<00:01:26.189> towel

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
have a lot of time right one bath towel

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.760 
have a lot of time right one bath towel
you<00:01:26.670> fold<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> halfway<00:01:27.869> mark<00:01:28.170> ok

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you fold it to about the halfway mark ok

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.960 
you fold it to about the halfway mark ok
just<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> pretty<00:01:29.640> even

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just like that and have it pretty even

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.870 
just like that and have it pretty even
this<00:01:30.600> side<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.869> fold<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> over<00:01:31.530> mm-hmm<00:01:32.369> just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this side you fold it over mm-hmm just

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380 
this side you fold it over mm-hmm just
like<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.439> probably<00:01:34.920> about<00:01:35.390> three

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
like so and you're probably about three

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.170 
like so and you're probably about three
or<00:01:36.420> four<00:01:36.570> inches<00:01:37.729> over<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> halfway<00:01:39.000> mark

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
or four inches over the halfway mark

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270 
or four inches over the halfway mark
okay<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.170> want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> fold<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.740> into<00:01:40.860> thirds<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
okay you want to fold it into thirds so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
okay you want to fold it into thirds so
what<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> usually<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> grab<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.329> mm-hmm

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
what I usually do I grab it here mm-hmm

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260 
what I usually do I grab it here mm-hmm
and<00:01:43.350> pull<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.490> almost<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.880> Z

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and pull it up so it's almost like a Z

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.980 
and pull it up so it's almost like a Z
type<00:01:46.070> shape<00:01:47.119> now<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> folded

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
