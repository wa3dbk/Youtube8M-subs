00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 ah 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.850
 at 11 o'clock as if welcome to all in 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.790
 the title how to drive inside the garage 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.529
 that's how they see it here I'm in the middle 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.300
 of everything the garage is doing and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.740
 the truth is that it's a pretty father trick 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 and something funny is not with a little 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 València trolley or book how is it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 you are driving inside the garage if it is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.420
 something that can not be done , 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 can the processes are very simple and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 the requirements are very few ok what 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 first that we will need obviously is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.790
 a garage and then a car inside the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 garage whether personal stolen as it is and 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.420
 once they have that what they will have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.880
 what to do will be to take out your phone and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.230
 quick activity see you at random and a 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.300
 once this screen is on and they are 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 inside a vehicle what they will have to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 to do is simply because they can already 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.670
 drive but they can only drive from 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.559
 reverse as they see it or can handle it from 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.969
 another way is the only way that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 can and can accommodate the a as 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.960
 you want not as long as you know 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.670
 maneuver the car and other things not here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.560
 then the car and in revel are medium 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.940
 difficult tarpaulins as well did not let me 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.800
 move them a lot but one of the I'm 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.619
 sure that he will let you move them a lot 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.540
 more to see and it's already stuck that this one 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.310
 if it's already stuck but it does not matter 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.240
 right now, I'm moving 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.340
 practically what 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.869
 the cars inside the garage the truth 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 that is something that looks pretty father 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.820
 It looks pretty funny, we're going to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.250
 move this great war to see how 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.659
 remains or this is my vehicle hack because 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.189
 has my plates the truth that you see 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.539
 quite father all this the truth that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.610
 it's something that looks pretty pretty or 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.380
 move like your trucks but what 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.539
 only bad that he can not go out to rózsa 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 well the try to accelerate and as the nato 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.960
 the car almost leaves me but 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 that the only thing that leaves me is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.679
 practically then it is to throw the car of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 reverse but I think it's something 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.850
 Pretty father, nothing more than giving 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.959
 something troll and something weird I did not the garage 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.119
