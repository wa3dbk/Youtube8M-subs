really clear except all you can go like

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.100 
really clear except all you can go like
in<00:03:15.849> these<00:03:16.000> little<00:03:16.299> holes<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.659> I'm<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:16.959> going

to go in there but you can't get out
once<00:03:18.519> again<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.989> it's<00:03:20.140> kind<00:03:20.349> of<00:03:20.379> like<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.620> safety

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
once again so it's kind of like a safety

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.260 
once again so it's kind of like a safety
barrier

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270
