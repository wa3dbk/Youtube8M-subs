will<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.649> raid<00:00:46.920> footage<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:48.649> myself<00:00:49.649> comparing

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
will in raid footage of myself comparing

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
will in raid footage of myself comparing
keyboard<00:00:51.660> turning<00:00:52.079> versus<00:00:52.530> Mouse<00:00:53.160> turning

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
keyboard turning versus Mouse turning

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
keyboard turning versus Mouse turning
because<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:55.140> never<00:00:55.289> put<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> raid<00:00:55.800> through

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.350 
strafe and you keep running
now<00:02:05.290> that's<00:02:05.500> usually<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.520> method<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:06.940> use<00:02:07.150> and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
now that's usually the method I use and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.050 
now that's usually the method I use and
you<00:02:07.479> see<00:02:07.570> how<00:02:07.750> quick<00:02:08.050> that<00:02:08.200> was<00:02:08.700> when<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:09.880> say

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
you see how quick that was when we say

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.140 
you see how quick that was when we say
that<00:02:10.209> keyboard<00:02:10.840> turning<00:02:11.319> sucks<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.850> that's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
that keyboard turning sucks and that's

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.540 
that keyboard turning sucks and that's
true<00:02:13.450> don't<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> does<00:02:14.590> don't<00:02:15.069> think<00:02:15.400> it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
true don't think it does don't think it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.380 
true don't think it does don't think it
it's<00:02:15.880> good<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.470> isn't<00:02:18.239> we're<00:02:19.239> not

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
it's good because it isn't we're not

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's good because it isn't we're not
saying<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.690> all<00:02:20.050> keyboard<00:02:20.590> true<00:02:20.800> all

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
saying that all keyboard true all

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.699 
saying that all keyboard true all
keyboard<00:02:21.760> movement<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.239> bad<00:02:22.470> strafing<00:02:23.470> and

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
keyboard movement is bad strafing and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.790 
keyboard movement is bad strafing and
moving<00:02:24.010> forward<00:02:24.459> are<00:02:24.930> very<00:02:25.930> useful<00:02:26.440> for

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
moving forward are very useful for

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.260 
moving forward are very useful for
example<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.310> do<00:02:27.400> huge<00:02:27.730> arcs<00:02:28.150> where

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
example you can do huge arcs where

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.790 
example you can do huge arcs where
you're<00:02:28.420> always<00:02:28.600> facing<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.140> boss<00:02:29.410> when

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
you're always facing the boss when

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.680 
you're always facing the boss when
you're<00:02:29.920> controlling<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:30.910> characters<00:02:31.390> turn

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
you're controlling your characters turn

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.770 
you're controlling your characters turn
with<00:02:31.900> your<00:02:32.019> mouse<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.260> using<00:02:32.920> strafe<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.630> can

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
with your mouse and using strafe you can

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.229 
with your mouse and using strafe you can
constantly<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:35.860> changing<00:02:36.310> direction<00:02:36.640> like

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
constantly be changing direction like

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:37.740 
constantly be changing direction like
this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.250 
this
there's<00:02:38.200> no<00:02:38.560> slowly<00:02:39.730> oh<00:02:39.940> no<00:02:40.630> he's<00:02:40.870> over<00:02:40.989> here

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
there's no slowly oh no he's over here

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.910 
there's no slowly oh no he's over here
oh<00:02:41.440> no<00:02:42.130> back<00:02:42.519> oh<00:02:42.790> where<00:02:43.570> am<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.230> it's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
oh no back oh where am I going it's it's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.620 
oh no back oh where am I going it's it's
so<00:02:45.160> much<00:02:45.370> quicker<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.730> be<00:02:46.060> able<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.269> change

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
so much quicker to be able to change

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.060 
so much quicker to be able to change
your<00:02:46.810> direction<00:02:46.959> at<00:02:47.410> any<00:02:47.560> moment's<00:02:48.040> notice

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
your direction at any moment's notice

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.350 
your direction at any moment's notice
and<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:50.200> just<00:02:50.470> why<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.670> mouse<00:02:51.820> turning<00:02:52.150> is

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
and that's just why the mouse turning is

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.870 
and that's just why the mouse turning is
so<00:02:52.690> much<00:02:52.989> better<00:02:53.230> especially<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:54.190> PvP<00:02:54.670> in

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
so much better especially in PvP in

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.380 
so much better especially in PvP in
rating<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.890> can<00:02:57.010> get<00:02:57.130> away<00:02:57.250> with<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.730> you're

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
rating you can get away with it you're

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.820 
rating you can get away with it you're
probably<00:02:58.510> going<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.810> wipe<00:02:58.959> your<00:02:59.110> raid<00:02:59.350> several

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
probably going to wipe your raid several

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.110 
probably going to wipe your raid several
times<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.400> they're<00:03:00.489> gonna<00:03:00.610> get<00:03:00.700> pissed<00:03:00.970> off

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
times and they're gonna get pissed off

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.350 
times and they're gonna get pissed off
at<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.840> suck<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:03.239> really<00:03:04.239> it's

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
at you because you suck and really it's

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.640 
at you because you suck and really it's
not<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.510> hard<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.870> learn<00:03:05.049> how<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> most<00:03:05.440> turn

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
not that hard to learn how to most turn

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.789 
not that hard to learn how to most turn
I<00:03:05.860> don't<00:03:06.160> know<00:03:06.250> why<00:03:06.370> people<00:03:06.670> are<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:06.910> against

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
I don't know why people are so against

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.420 
I don't know why people are so against
converting<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.209> PvP<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.430> keyboard

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430

so<00:03:43.989> incoming<00:03:44.799> since<00:03:45.250> your<00:03:45.340> goes<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.549> teleport

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
so incoming since your goes to teleport

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.940 
so incoming since your goes to teleport
do<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.170> 180<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.220> run<00:03:48.850> back

so<00:03:53.370> just<00:03:54.060> from<00:03:54.180> doing<00:03:54.300> that<00:03:54.450> alone<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.780> can

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
so just from doing that alone you can

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.700 
so just from doing that alone you can
see<00:03:55.380> how<00:03:56.310> slow<00:03:56.640> Keibler<00:03:57.240> turning<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.690> but<00:03:58.320> I'll

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
see how slow Keibler turning is but I'll

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.580 
see how slow Keibler turning is but I'll
put<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.190> side-by-side<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.470> we're<00:04:01.470> going

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
put on the side-by-side and we're going

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.990 
put on the side-by-side and we're going
to<00:04:01.620> try<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.800> put<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.040> timer<00:04:02.310> up<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.760> I'll<00:04:02.850> show

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
to try to put the timer up and I'll show

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.090 
to try to put the timer up and I'll show
you<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.120> how<00:04:03.300> much<00:04:03.450> extra<00:04:03.840> time<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.140> get<00:04:04.560> by

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
you just how much extra time you get by

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:25.270 
you just how much extra time you get by
most<00:04:05.490> turning<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.330> situation<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:06.870> that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.430 

now<00:04:26.030> for<00:04:26.210> those<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.660> are<00:04:26.840> interested

now for those of you that are interested

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.720 
now for those of you that are interested
in<00:04:27.640> converting<00:04:28.640> from<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.710> slow<00:04:30.730> inefficient

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
in converting from the slow inefficient

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.020 
in converting from the slow inefficient
keyboard<00:04:32.480> turning<00:04:32.870> method<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:34.030> most

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
keyboard turning method to the most

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.880 
keyboard turning method to the most
learning<00:04:35.240> method<00:04:35.540> it's<00:04:35.750> pretty<00:04:36.560> simple

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
learning method it's pretty simple

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.190 
learning method it's pretty simple
actually<00:04:37.150> most<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.420> problems<00:04:38.870> with

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
actually most of the problems with

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.480 
actually most of the problems with
converting<00:04:40.160> stems<00:04:40.850> from<00:04:41.830> clickers<00:04:42.830> people

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
converting stems from clickers people

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.200 
converting stems from clickers people
that<00:04:43.730> actually<00:04:44.660> take<00:04:44.870> their<00:04:45.050> mouse<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:46.210> click

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
that actually take their mouse and click

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.800 
that actually take their mouse and click
their<00:04:47.420> spells<00:04:47.750> instead<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.380> pressing<00:04:48.740> a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
their spells instead of pressing a

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.950 
their spells instead of pressing a
keyboard<00:04:50.810> keyboard<00:04:51.560> button<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.100> do<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.520> and

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
keyboard keyboard button to do that and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.550 
keyboard keyboard button to do that and
I'm<00:04:53.960> gonna<00:04:54.080> make<00:04:54.260> another<00:04:54.290> video<00:04:55.420> relating

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
I'm gonna make another video relating

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.380 
I'm gonna make another video relating
keybindings<00:04:57.560> versus<00:04:58.160> clicking<00:04:58.910> have<00:04:59.210> some

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
keybindings versus clicking have some

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.180 
keybindings versus clicking have some
pretty<00:04:59.540> interesting<00:04:59.780> ideas<00:05:00.410> on<00:05:00.590> I'm<00:05:01.040> gonna

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
pretty interesting ideas on I'm gonna

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.670 
pretty interesting ideas on I'm gonna
compare<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.730> two<00:05:01.910> but<00:05:02.260> for<00:05:03.260> straight<00:05:03.530> up

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
compare the two but for straight up

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.100 
compare the two but for straight up
people<00:05:04.400> who<00:05:04.640> just<00:05:05.300> might<00:05:05.540> not<00:05:05.720> know<00:05:05.930> how<00:05:06.080> to

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
people who just might not know how to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.590 
people who just might not know how to
Mouse<00:05:07.100> turn<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:07.880> pretty<00:05:08.150> simple<00:05:08.450> actually

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
Mouse turn it's pretty simple actually

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.659 
Mouse turn it's pretty simple actually
your<00:05:09.200> left<00:05:09.470> mouse<00:05:09.770> your<00:05:10.280> left<00:05:10.490> mouse<00:05:10.610> button

your left mouse your left mouse button

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.540 
your left mouse your left mouse button
controls<00:05:11.510> your<00:05:11.750> camera<00:05:12.230> it<00:05:12.770> doesn't<00:05:12.980> control

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
controls your camera it doesn't control

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.770 
controls your camera it doesn't control
your<00:05:13.669> character<00:05:13.820> at<00:05:14.120> all<00:05:14.240> just<00:05:14.480> controls

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
your character at all just controls

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.080 
your character at all just controls
where<00:05:14.990> you're<00:05:15.140> looking<00:05:15.320> around<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:16.040> world

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
where you're looking around the world

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.360 
where you're looking around the world
your<00:05:17.090> right<00:05:17.360> mouse<00:05:17.570> button<00:05:17.990> controls<00:05:18.710> your

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
character direction when you use the two

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.880 
character direction when you use the two
together<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:24.110> controls<00:05:24.470> your<00:05:24.560> character's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
together it controls your character's

together it controls your character's
direction<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.610> your<00:05:25.910> camera<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.570> you're

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
direction and your camera so you're

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.190 
direction and your camera so you're
always<00:05:27.050> moving<00:05:27.580> where<00:05:28.580> your<00:05:28.730> camera<00:05:29.120> is<00:05:29.270> but

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
always moving where your camera is but

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.140 
always moving where your camera is but
say<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.470> want<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.860> pivot<00:05:31.340> without<00:05:31.880> moving

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
say you want to pivot without moving

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.030 
say you want to pivot without moving
forward<00:05:32.540> you<00:05:32.660> just<00:05:32.690> left<00:05:33.020> you<00:05:33.440> just<00:05:33.590> let<00:05:33.770> go<00:05:33.919> of

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
forward you just left you just let go of

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.430 
forward you just left you just let go of
the<00:05:34.190> left<00:05:34.550> mouse<00:05:34.880> button<00:05:34.910> and<00:05:35.360> then<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.169> just

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
the left mouse button and then you just

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.040 
the left mouse button and then you just
sit<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.160> pivot<00:05:37.850> around<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.570> single<00:05:39.200> axis<00:05:39.830> and

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
sit and pivot around a single axis and

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.080 
sit and pivot around a single axis and
just<00:05:42.050> look<00:05:42.260> around<00:05:42.380> so<00:05:42.919> I<00:05:43.160> like<00:05:43.790> doing<00:05:44.000> that

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
just look around so I like doing that

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.210 
just look around so I like doing that
for<00:05:44.330> you<00:05:44.690> know<00:05:44.840> jumping<00:05:45.410> because<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:45.860> jump<00:05:46.130> a

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
for you know jumping because I jump a

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.150 
for you know jumping because I jump a
lot<00:05:46.250> but<00:05:48.400> generally<00:05:49.400> that<00:05:49.760> has<00:05:50.030> its<00:05:50.210> uses<00:05:50.390> too

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
lot but generally that has its uses too

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.620 
lot but generally that has its uses too
and<00:05:52.160> yeah<00:05:52.310> it's<00:05:52.430> really<00:05:52.729> not<00:05:53.300> all<00:05:53.510> that

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
and yeah it's really not all that

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.450 
and yeah it's really not all that
difficult<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:54.110> convert<00:05:54.410> like<00:05:54.740> I<00:05:54.830> said<00:05:55.040> most<00:05:55.340> of

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
difficult to convert like I said most of

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.550 
difficult to convert like I said most of
it<00:05:55.550> comes<00:05:55.760> from<00:05:55.940> people<00:05:56.150> who<00:05:56.510> are<00:05:57.110> keyboard

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
it comes from people who are keyboard

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.530 
it comes from people who are keyboard
turning<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.100> using<00:05:59.000> their<00:05:59.120> mouse<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.419> click

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
turning and using their mouse to click

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.300 
turning and using their mouse to click
their<00:05:59.780> spells<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:00.650> want<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.040> put<00:06:01.160> out<00:06:01.280> that

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
their spells so I want to put out that

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.180 
their spells so I want to put out that
video<00:06:01.640> hopefully<00:06:02.540> it'll<00:06:03.380> make<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:03.890> little<00:06:04.040> bit

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
video hopefully it'll make a little bit

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.830 
video hopefully it'll make a little bit
more<00:06:04.310> sense<00:06:04.610> this<00:06:05.120> is<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.240> pretty<00:06:05.450> short<00:06:05.720> video

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
more sense this is a pretty short video

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.430 
more sense this is a pretty short video
but<00:06:06.410> I<00:06:06.470> hope<00:06:06.620> you<00:06:06.770> guys<00:06:06.950> enjoyed<00:06:07.520> it<00:06:07.700> so<00:06:08.630> I'll
