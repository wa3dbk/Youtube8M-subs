00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
difference and it's very subtle and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.340 
difference and it's very subtle and
natural<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:58.090> it's<00:01:59.090> gradual<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.810> builds<00:02:00.200> up

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
natural and it's gradual it builds up

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.889 
natural and it's gradual it builds up
over<00:02:00.499> time<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.249> increases<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.240> collagen

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
over time and it increases the collagen
