00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 it was going well is a game that 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.549
 characterized by requiring a level of 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.099
 very high intellectual as well as 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.260
 skill in this case we see a and that is 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.349
 faces a ship which leaves in 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.700
 evidence of the lack of skill at the time of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.460
 character control look how it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.550
 tide on the bus and look at that fail flash 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 determines that not everyone in this game is 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.670
 prof 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.670
 Welcome to this the new replay 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 two 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:56.559
 in the first new style move 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.600
 replay is sent to cristian rosso there 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.760
 we have how to drive a hard van 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.640
 escaping the clutches of a yasuo and a 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.100
 brawn that you want to make two children by 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.229
 the back but when you hook it 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.440
 they do not count on beating the audi and grabbing 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.149
 with the lamp of three escaping 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.180
 successfully and the best thing is that he gets 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.340
 the blue team defeat the two 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.800
 usurpers who wanted to take over the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.619
 coal now that we're going to give the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.030
 repetition I want to invite you to comment 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:31.000
 if this was an accident or this player 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.700
 has a real gift for predicting where 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.390
 exactly the lamp was going to fall 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.870
 stress 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.020
 this is a great doubt that we have and why 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.300
 please participate to publicize your 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 opinion 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.160
 today we are going to learn the terminology that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 says to give up skill to escape from 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.450
 various ways fooling the rival to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.940
 that believe that we have taken a course 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 different to leave the rivals as 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.330
 fucked up and it's also a kind of 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.280
 benissa let's see an example a 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.240
 example of iuc del lol will not bring you 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.240
 example of nissan 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.970
 let's focus on this media as 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.790
 to escape from this evelyn that is 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.010
 starting to you to give to eliminate it 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.320
 comes the fish also looking for a 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.510
 little bit here that the flex came in from a 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.520
 admirable way inside the bus in the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.230
 fair limit so you do not see it believe 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.960
 that he went ahead and when in 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.960
 reality was fitting perfectly 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.150
 third parties play sends from friends 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.069
 red 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.389
 and it shows us how with a set also 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.239
 you can make a good look 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.799
 if you have some skill to too 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.989
 fast for good I'm going to put it in 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.459
 slow motion looks stops the shadows 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.430
 forwards first of all reserving 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.560
 position the two skewers pulled Casyc 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.389
 and about to finish it and with the victory 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.389
 insured assisted but at that moment 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.519
 he dodged it was in a range of 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.139
 microseconds because you saw it before and 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.819
 come queen of the ordina not sensitivity 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.680
 the casyc was able to escape but he stayed 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.889
 with the desire the guy saw him kill him 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.889
 set 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.180
 the fourth move moves us to what 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.219
 it's been a domain, you remember the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.040
 domain that you do not sign up as 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.319
 thousand years you have to observe the sips that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.689
 it is a kind of let's say contempt 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.579
 monumental by the skills of said 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.840
 character we started with this flash that 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.450
 he threw himself before he has kept very well 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.430
 so that the last one that would try to 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.670
 better clean some gustito for and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.109
 good gives you area and chaco eliminate without 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.269
 any kind of problems making the 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.639
 that would surely be tapping the six 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.739
 the six uses what has been its 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.810
 new object to follow fast and is 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.599
 trying to get revenge on sack which with 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.500
 the last more area they leave quite 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.500
 muertito 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.130
 the first nominee for this event of 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:23.130
 useless of the year is if the second nominee 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:26.000
 is 6 and the third nominee is 6 and the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.000
 winner is 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.830
 very well in the mind gives you a little bit of 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.510
 pain asking steffi from the other side but 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.550
 that dominate dominial there remain domain no 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.200
 Whatever it like the fifth and final 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.270
 play takes place in bot we have a 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.460
 lioness in that child hooked up that 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 face a bliss skull of ayora that 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.150
 the link was staying lion will attend 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.660
 with everything to try to avoid it thing that 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.090
 goes wrong 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.740
 yesterday they threw her, she took advantage, she tried to kill 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.330
 from here again what you see 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.920
 pretty disastrous look at the life that 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.480
 they are not far from life and from here 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.340
 I gave them the azulino team as he 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.340
 is behind comes what I have to prevent 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.740
 is when you decide you decide to move forward 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.060
 to hit a single tap but 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.980
 Of course it does not count that the bliss is there 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.680
 crack to prevent it from being with yours and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.870
 kill his mate dies and now 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.320
 The best is coming 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:18.640
 an enemy has disconnected that yes that 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.240
 he is a good king as he touches report streak 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.240
 of the enemy 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.280
 and now we go with the pros section 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.280
 it's called I have hands and I show it 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.630
 I do not leave you this bonus clip as a gift 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.630
 look at the catarina 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.180
 or not 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.900
 milk 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.200
 I can not exit until I have a thousand hits 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.090
 that is too much 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.260
 Hello
