are<00:00:08.370> four<00:00:08.519> pens<00:00:09.530> from<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:11.010> don't<00:00:11.280> know<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.519> you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
are four pens from I don't know if you

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
are four pens from I don't know if you
can<00:00:11.730> see<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.090> close-up<00:00:12.630> not<00:00:13.320> 0.1<00:00:13.740> millimeter

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
can see this close-up not 0.1 millimeter

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.240 
can see this close-up not 0.1 millimeter
no<00:00:14.849> point<00:00:15.089> three<00:00:15.269> not<00:00:15.570> 0.5<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.500> 0.7

no point three not 0.5 and not 0.7
millimeter<00:00:17.760> thickness<00:00:18.710> okay<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> just

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
millimeter thickness okay so if you just

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.250 
millimeter thickness okay so if you just
have<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> look<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:20.939> them<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:22.080> come<00:00:22.230> a

have a look at them first they come a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.509 
have a look at them first they come a
nice<00:00:22.470> little<00:00:22.680> packet<00:00:23.160> which<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.650> turn

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
nice little packet which you can turn

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.269 
nice little packet which you can turn
into<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:27.590> you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.220> a

little stand on your desk like that if

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
little stand on your desk like that if
you<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.619> nice<00:00:31.800> isn't<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.390> um<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:34.190> like

you want to it's nice isn't it um I like

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.819 
you want to it's nice isn't it um I like
loads<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.910> other<00:00:36.030> people's<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:37.350> pencil

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
loads of other people's do pencil

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.709 
loads of other people's do pencil
sketches<00:00:38.309> when<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.610> sort<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> noodling

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sketches when I'm sort of noodling

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.840 
sketches when I'm sort of noodling
through<00:00:40.020> design<00:00:40.559> ideas<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.370> I've<00:00:41.610> got

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
through design ideas and I've got

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.350 
through design ideas and I've got
millions<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.329> sketchbooks<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:44.360> full

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
millions of sketchbooks like this full

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.029 
millions of sketchbooks like this full
of<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:46.250> scribblings<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:48.530> normally<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
of my scribblings and normally I think I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
of my scribblings and normally I think I
still<00:00:50.250> work<00:00:50.399> through<00:00:50.899> different<00:00:51.899> sketches<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
still work through different sketches so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
still work through different sketches so
here's<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.430> first<00:00:53.640> sketches<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.270> some

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
here's some the first sketches for some

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.099 
here's some the first sketches for some
spider<00:00:54.750> pieces<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.149> yeah<00:01:00.109> but

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
spider pieces which you can see yeah but

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.590 
spider pieces which you can see yeah but
I'm<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> technical<00:01:02.280> draw

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
I'm not much of a technical draw

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.910 
I'm not much of a technical draw
technical<00:01:03.600> Drori<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.140> haven't<00:01:04.439> had<00:01:04.589> some

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
technical Drori I haven't had some

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.350 
technical Drori I haven't had some
formal<00:01:05.729> jewelry<00:01:06.330> training<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.960> don't<00:01:07.320> use

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
formal jewelry training I don't use

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
formal jewelry training I don't use
computer<00:01:09.360> aided<00:01:09.510> design<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.280> have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
computer aided design and I don't have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
computer aided design and I don't have
really<00:01:12.299> possess<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.780> technical<00:01:13.290> drawing

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
really possess any technical drawing

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
really possess any technical drawing
skills<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.670> I've<00:01:15.000> always<00:01:15.270> thought<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> these

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
skills and I've always thought of these

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.859 
skills and I've always thought of these
much<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.680> technical<00:01:17.430> drawing<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
much more for technical drawing so I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.240 
much more for technical drawing so I
thought<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.110> quite<00:01:19.290> interesting<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> test

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
thought we quite interesting to test

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.560 
thought we quite interesting to test
them<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:21.420> sketching<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.470> um<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:24.360> we

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
them out just sketching as I do um if we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
them out just sketching as I do um if we
have<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> look<00:01:25.170> I'll<00:01:25.500> show<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:25.890> very<00:01:26.189> first

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
have a look I'll show you my very first

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
have a look I'll show you my very first
go<00:01:28.220> okay<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.420> first<00:01:30.960> try<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
go okay so it's my first first try of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.600 
go okay so it's my first first try of
use<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.960> pens<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.770> surprised<00:01:35.159> how

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
use in the pens I was surprised how

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
use in the pens I was surprised how
quickly<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.329> used<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> using<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.170> instead

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
quickly I got used to using them instead

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
quickly I got used to using them instead
of<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> pencil<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.340> didn't<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.240> they'd<00:01:39.420> be

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of a pencil I didn't think they'd be

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
of a pencil I didn't think they'd be
soft<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.990> flexible<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.369> as

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
soft as flexible if you like it as

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.600 
soft as flexible if you like it as
pencil<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.140> quite<00:01:43.740> enjoyed<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
pencil but and I quite enjoyed it and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980 
pencil but and I quite enjoyed it and
sort<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> working<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.360> where<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> use<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
sort of working out where to use the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.260 
sort of working out where to use the
different<00:01:46.369> thicknesses<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> can

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
different thicknesses and there you can

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.210 
different thicknesses and there you can
see<00:01:51.450> there's<00:01:51.930> some<00:01:52.079> designs<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.829> turned

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
see there's some designs that turned

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.120 
see there's some designs that turned
into<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.820> something<00:01:54.680> quite<00:01:55.680> similar<00:01:55.920> actually

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
into it something quite similar actually

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
into it something quite similar actually
we<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.210> normally<00:01:57.329> turn<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.079> close

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
we don't normally turn out that close

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.139 
we don't normally turn out that close
but<00:02:00.020> yeah<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.320> found<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.000> they're

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
but yeah I found them you know they're

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.569 
but yeah I found them you know they're
very<00:02:03.329> easy<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.649> only<00:02:05.189> difference

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
very easy to use the only difference

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.119 
very easy to use the only difference
from<00:02:05.640> sort<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> pencil<00:02:06.420> sketching<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
from sort of pencil sketching for me is

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.050 
from sort of pencil sketching for me is
if<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.849> at<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> nibs

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
if you look at the nibs

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.420 
if you look at the nibs
sorry<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> thickest<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:14.280> you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
sorry so this is the thickest one if you
