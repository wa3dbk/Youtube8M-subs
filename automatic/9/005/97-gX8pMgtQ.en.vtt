00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.030
 well i have opened the books like 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.810
 chassis and what we have left is the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.810
 can see chakras for 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.960
 very nice of course have nothing a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.900
 quick start guide 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.240
 but we don't have to do everything either 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.820
 operations meijer on either 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.490
 needed because yes 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.930
 The most important thing is that look 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.930
 start out slide 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.120
 drop that from the space on the handle 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.420
 and there he is the new Nintendo 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.900
 3ds I imagine that they open me forward 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.900
 clapping 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.550
 first click ' 2 x direction 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.090
 does not need all and yes 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.390
 as you can see 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.330
 really a beautiful thing a whole 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.209
 curious about the decorative bow 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.930
 that really feels you can really hardly 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.459
 move that is there I think I have one 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.450
 no idea how you should ever do that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:00.079
 use but no say at least you 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.310
 now see it 3d here 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:11.480
 stiff on this side you now have for now 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:14.239
 I sit there because the circle is what she is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.799
 from moving here to button select 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.799
 A go-ahead went there 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.989
 if you can look well here over there 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.920
 there is the the power button 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:33.109
 the stylus you are 6 in the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.780
 cartridge for well many people dirk van 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.329
 yes if I do that things sometimes 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.210
 then of course you click the window and so on 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.850
 but that is not the case at all 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.470
 yes your hand actually becomes this way 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.970
 go against so I couldn't stand the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.400
 cartridge on so you won't have to 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.400
 pregnant women and furthermore the stylus 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 I have an email this 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.890
 ok this is the stylus like the focus 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.890
 focus focus 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.709
 this is the stylus so completely fine 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.709
 I don't care much about that either 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.760
 and of course you now have two two 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:23.400
 new buttons yes 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.720
 left back and right back both yes me 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.550
 think it will work with 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.370
 fighting games and stuff so that they do 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.440
 then the charger 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.550
 it in it as you see and yes that is 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.840
 it actually is 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.620
 and what so naturally in 3ds are without 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.750
 charger proposals and pokÃ©mon 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.340
 of course, because too freaking awesome 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.150
 so yes 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.850
 level yes i'm going to play it and i'm late 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.940

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.940
 you 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.330
 and that the volume customer after 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:02.630
 buys asia and boxing liked and yes 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:04.930
