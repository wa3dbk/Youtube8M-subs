00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.610 
and also anything else like the year of
when<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> publishers<00:02:21.270> started<00:02:22.260> publishing

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
when the publishers started publishing

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.220 
when the publishers started publishing
any<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.000> could<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.330> stored<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.750> here

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
any of that could be stored in here

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.690 
any of that could be stored in here
but<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.650> you'da<00:02:25.860> stored<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.310> up<00:02:26.460> in<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
but if you'da stored this up in the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.490 
but if you'da stored this up in the
books<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.900> wouldn't<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.320> been

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
books then that wouldn't have been

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.580 
books then that wouldn't have been
possible<00:02:30.350> okay

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
possible okay

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800 
possible okay
genre<00:02:32.490> this<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.150> we're<00:02:33.300> going<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.630> deal

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
genre this is what we're going to deal

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.610 
genre this is what we're going to deal
with<00:02:33.840> next<00:02:34.320> now<00:02:35.040> think<00:02:35.310> about<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.760> little

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
with next now think about this a little

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.980 
with next now think about this a little
usually<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> book<00:02:38.040> will<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.730> genre<00:02:39.420> such

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
usually a book will have one genre such

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.610 
usually a book will have one genre such
as<00:02:40.290> science<00:02:41.100> fiction<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.260> do

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
as science fiction so it's up to you do

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.740 
as science fiction so it's up to you do
you<00:02:43.710> want<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.950> make<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> new<00:02:44.580> table<00:02:44.850> listing<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
you want to make a new table listing the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.990 
you want to make a new table listing the
genres<00:02:46.350> which<00:02:47.010> will<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.250> tied<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
genres which will be tied back to the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.030 
genres which will be tied back to the
books<00:02:48.330> or<00:02:48.960> do<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> list<00:02:49.740> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
books or do you just want to list the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.970 
books or do you just want to list the
genre<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.240> with<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> books<00:02:51.780> well<00:02:52.710> see<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
genre right with the books well see I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.670 
genre right with the books well see I
always<00:02:53.520> like<00:02:53.730> making<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.660> new<00:02:54.930> table<00:02:55.170> because

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
always like making a new table because

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.550 
always like making a new table because
it<00:02:55.860> makes<00:02:56.070> things<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.400> much<00:02:56.550> easier<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it makes things so much easier but you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
it makes things so much easier but you
don't<00:02:58.740> technically<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.550> because<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
don't technically have to because you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.790 
don't technically have to because you
can<00:03:00.300> just<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.570> listed<00:03:00.840> with<00:03:01.200> there<00:03:01.440> if

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
can just have it listed with there if

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.430 
can just have it listed with there if
you<00:03:02.340> needed<00:03:02.760> more<00:03:03.000> than<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.210> genre<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you needed more than one genre then you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.970 
you needed more than one genre then you
could<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:05.420> new<00:03:06.420> table<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.950> I

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
could have a new table for it but I

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.450 
could have a new table for it but I
would<00:03:08.400> recommend<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:09.710> see<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
would recommend this see this is the the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.160 
would recommend this see this is the the
thing<00:03:11.640> about<00:03:11.670> normalization<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.960> more

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
thing about normalization the more

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.080 
thing about normalization the more
normalized<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:13.980> get<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.460> more<00:03:14.610> tables

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
normalized you get and the more tables

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.510 
normalized you get and the more tables
the<00:03:15.270> more<00:03:15.450> mess<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.250> make

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
the more mess there is and it can make

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.820 
the more mess there is and it can make
things<00:03:17.550> kind<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.060> slow<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.020> it's<00:03:19.320> not<00:03:19.440> always

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
things kind of slow so it's not always

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.570 
things kind of slow so it's not always
good<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.280> normalize<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.970> database<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:22.140> a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
good to normalize the database to a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.510 
good to normalize the database to a
certain<00:03:23.600> extent<00:03:24.600> at<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.830> point<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.250> becomes

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
certain extent at one point it becomes

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.110 
certain extent at one point it becomes
too<00:03:27.030> much<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.320> we're<00:03:29.310> gonna<00:03:29.459> make<00:03:29.670> Jonas

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
too much so we're gonna make Jonas

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.260 
too much so we're gonna make Jonas
because<00:03:30.930> that's<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> want

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
because that's what I want

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:41.120 
because that's what I want
genre<00:03:33.270> IV<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:39.180> also<00:03:39.360> an<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:40.530> anything<00:03:40.920> else

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
genre IV but also an have anything else

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.740 
genre IV but also an have anything else
if<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.760> need<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.000> put<00:03:42.480> more<00:03:42.600> information

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
if you need to put more information

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.510 
if you need to put more information
about<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.320> genre<00:03:43.350> but<00:03:43.740> there's<00:03:44.220> nothing

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
about the genre but there's nothing

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.940 
about the genre but there's nothing
really<00:03:44.670> else<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.030> could<00:03:45.209> put<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:46.650> back<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
really else I could put so now back to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.800 
really else I could put so now back to
the<00:03:47.190> books<00:03:47.370> table<00:03:47.580> we're<00:03:48.330> going<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.660> make<00:03:48.780> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
the books table we're going to make a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.800 
the books table we're going to make a
foreign<00:03:49.170> key<00:03:49.380> wait<00:03:50.310> first<00:03:50.610> let's<00:03:51.360> change<00:03:51.570> it

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
foreign key wait first let's change it

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.960 
foreign key wait first let's change it
so<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.110> ready<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.320> get<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:53.820> our

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.770 
so it's ready to get in just as on our
ID<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:55.470> set<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.770> step<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:57.090> makes<00:03:57.510> it

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
ID and set the step in this makes it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.990 
ID and set the step in this makes it
able<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.740> foreign<00:03:59.070> key<00:03:59.250> with<00:03:59.550> this<00:03:59.700> genre

now under foreign keys we're going to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:15.820 
now under foreign keys we're going to
make<00:04:06.510> genre<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:12.830> Chandra<00:04:13.830> genre<00:04:14.160> sweet<00:04:14.910> now

make genre I Chandra genre sweet now
everything<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:17.040> connected<00:04:17.480> it<00:04:18.480> look<00:04:18.630> there<00:04:19.230> is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
everything is connected it look there is

everything is connected it look there is
right

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
right

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.390 
right
that's<00:04:20.820> pretty<00:04:21.090> messy<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:22.010> what<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.130> can<00:04:23.280> do

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that's pretty messy so what you can do

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.980 
that's pretty messy so what you can do
is<00:04:23.580> click<00:04:23.760> these<00:04:23.910> little<00:04:24.210> arrows

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
is click these little arrows

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.830 
is click these little arrows
once<00:04:25.110> you're<00:04:25.229> done<00:04:25.349> with<00:04:25.410> them<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:27.630> makes

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
once you're done with them and it makes

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
okay now a number of pages if you really

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.029 
okay now a number of pages if you really
really<00:04:41.729> wanted<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.900> could<00:04:43.169> have<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.470> table

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
really wanted to you could have a table

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.219 
really wanted to you could have a table
with<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.729> books<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.660> then<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.900> number<00:04:46.199> of

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
with the books and then the number of

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.219 
with the books and then the number of
pages<00:04:46.590> for<00:04:46.979> each<00:04:47.130> book<00:04:47.430> cuz<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.479> certain<00:04:49.080> number

pages for each book cuz a certain number

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.260 
pages for each book cuz a certain number
Kenneth<00:04:49.979> that<00:04:50.370> technically<00:04:50.789> could<00:04:51.090> be<00:04:51.240> a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
Kenneth that technically could be a

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.689 
Kenneth that technically could be a
many-to-many<00:04:51.630> relationship<00:04:52.590> but<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.460> is

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
many-to-many relationship but that is

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.129 
many-to-many relationship but that is
where<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.000> think<00:04:54.210> you're<00:04:54.509> crossing<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.020> line

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
where I think you're crossing the line

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.159 
where I think you're crossing the line
of<00:04:55.560> two<00:04:55.889> normalized<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.360> had<00:04:57.479> a<00:04:57.509> book<00:04:57.720> where
