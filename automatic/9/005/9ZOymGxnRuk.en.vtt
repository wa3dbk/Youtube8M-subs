00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
that have two strong of competition so I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.120 
that have two strong of competition so I
know<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.570> all<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:22.109> ambitious<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.949> this

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130

world<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:25.140> target<00:00:25.439> competition

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
world but if you target competition

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.689 
world but if you target competition
keywords<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> try<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.670> too

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
keywords you are going to try way too

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.229 
keywords you are going to try way too
hard<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.539> achieve<00:00:31.470> results<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.940> just

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
hard to achieve results and you are just

going to get burnt right out so what
we're<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> show

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we're going to do is we're going to show

you<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.670> target<00:00:39.210> niche<00:00:40.200> keywords<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you how to target niche keywords that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.729 
you how to target niche keywords that
have<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.940> relatively<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:42.960> amount<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> traffic

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
have a relatively good amount of traffic

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.880 
have a relatively good amount of traffic
little<00:00:44.730> competition<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.710> can

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
little competition so that we can

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
little competition so that we can
actually<00:00:47.239> get<00:00:48.239> listed<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.050> keyword<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
actually get listed for that keyword and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
actually get listed for that keyword and
start<00:00:49.980> achieving<00:00:50.070> results<00:00:50.430> right<00:00:50.940> away<00:00:51.260> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
start achieving results right away and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.400 
start achieving results right away and
here's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:53.100> good<00:00:53.309> example<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.789> here

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
here's a very good example right here

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
here's a very good example right here
going<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.680> my<00:00:55.890> last<00:00:56.190> example<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.390> last

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
going from my last example in my last

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.279 
going from my last example in my last
video<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:58.739> from<00:00:59.010> home<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> key<00:01:00.090> word

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
video work from home was the key word

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
video work from home was the key word
and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.440> ended<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.770> looking<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.219> work<00:01:02.520> from

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and we ended up looking up work from

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.170 
and we ended up looking up work from
home<00:01:02.969> Edmonton<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.489> explained

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
home Edmonton now I just I explained

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
home Edmonton now I just I explained
those<00:01:06.479> two<00:01:06.810> keywords<00:01:07.350> differences<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
those two keywords differences as a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.520 
those two keywords differences as a
niche<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.380> micro<00:01:10.830> niche<00:01:11.100> okay<00:01:11.939> now

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
niche and a micro niche okay now

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.030 
niche and a micro niche okay now
typically<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.950> niche<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> very

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
typically a niche is going to be a very

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.870 
typically a niche is going to be a very
competitive<00:01:17.549> keyword<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.780> work<00:01:19.320> from<00:01:19.590> home

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
competitive keyword like work from home

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
competitive keyword like work from home
whereas<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.090> micro<00:01:21.600> niche<00:01:21.810> may<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.650> competitive

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
whereas a micro niche may be competitive

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.920 
whereas a micro niche may be competitive
and<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.939> may<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.119> some<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.659> aren't

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and there may be some that aren't

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
and there may be some that aren't
competitive<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.240> we're<00:01:27.390> basically

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
competitive so what we're basically

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.100 
competitive so what we're basically
looking<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.860> keywords<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:30.110> large

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
looking for is keywords that have large

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.819 
looking for is keywords that have large
amount<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> traffic<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:33.320> low<00:01:34.320> competition

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
amount of traffic and low competition

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190

going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.780> do<00:03:30.930> an<00:03:31.050> example<00:03:31.500> right<00:03:31.530> now<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.310> this

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
going to do an example right now so this

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.610 
going to do an example right now so this
is<00:03:32.670> definitely<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.900> we<00:03:34.080> don't<00:03:34.350> want<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
is definitely one that we don't want to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.750 
is definitely one that we don't want to
compete<00:03:34.890> with<00:03:34.950> because<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.400> don't<00:03:35.580> want<00:03:35.700> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
compete with because we don't want to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.030 
compete with because we don't want to
compete<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:37.160> 1,500<00:03:38.160> other<00:03:39.530> other<00:03:40.530> people

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
compete with 1,500 other other people

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.290 
compete with 1,500 other other people
that<00:03:41.300> seem<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.780> optimized<00:03:43.440> these<00:03:43.680> pages

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
that seem to have optimized these pages

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.900 
that seem to have optimized these pages
and<00:03:45.300> they<00:03:45.570> at<00:03:45.690> least<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.110> linkbacks<00:03:46.910> going

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
and they at least have linkbacks going

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.240 
and they at least have linkbacks going
to<00:03:48.030> these<00:03:48.180> pages<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:48.810> lots<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.530> competition<00:03:50.100> we

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
to these pages so lots of competition we

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.610 
to these pages so lots of competition we
don't<00:03:50.430> want<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.910> compete<00:03:51.180> with<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.410> let's

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
don't want to compete with that so let's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.580 
don't want to compete with that so let's
try<00:03:52.830> our<00:03:52.860> keyword<00:03:53.370> work<00:03:53.820> from<00:03:54.060> home<00:03:54.239> Edmonton

we have one competitor so basically what

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.130 
we have one competitor so basically what
this<00:04:02.100> tells<00:04:02.340> us<00:04:02.519> right<00:04:02.850> off<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.209> bat<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.690> that

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
this tells us right off the bat is that

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.460 
this tells us right off the bat is that
we<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:04.590> least<00:04:05.239> gain<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.269> stage<00:04:06.630> 1<00:04:06.930> ranking
