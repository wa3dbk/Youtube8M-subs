00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello everyone with you edge in this video 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.900
 I want to talk about such a thing as 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.570
 gamepads 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.490
 Keyboards and mice are of course convenient and 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.820
 familiar to all gamers who play on 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.590
 computers but sometimes either games force 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.650
 either you just want to play yourself 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.120
 some games using a gamepad yes yes 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.460
 it is a gamepad they jester 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.680
 joystick is such a thing in which the bug 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.100
 Simulator convenient to play a gamepad from 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:40.430
 a little bit more and I will tell for everyone 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 padok than they may differ and what 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.040
 gamepad you may be better for you by 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.770
 choice 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.410
 they may differ in appearance 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.970
 in turn this may slightly 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.290
 affect the functionality 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.780
 There are many on the market now 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.190
 firms providing quite wide 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.290
 the choice 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.180
 outwardly it should be noted two components 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.269
 shape and location of analog sticks 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.930
 plastics mushroom trucks call them as 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.719
 want to 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.479
 About the form I can say the following if 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.090
 You took the gamepad in your hands and you from the first 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.460
 it is more convenient to withstand pressing all 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.700
 buttons means this yes means your choice 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.909
 do not consider successful forms 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.070
 gamepad forms from xbox 360 and its 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.659
 Analogs are important to form 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.060
 the corresponding location now 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.150
 sticks 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.820
 hordes of hours worth the location stick them 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.990
 there are two types as we see on tv 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.770
 prefixes sony playstation dual shock and 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.810
 like x-box 360 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.549
 the difference is in the location of the left 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.010
 stick in the first case they are located 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.570
 next to each other near the center 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.570
 the crosspiece is on the left side 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.330
 gamepad second version and the left stick 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.220
 emergency swap stands 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.640
 note that each location is convenient 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 for specific types of games for shooters 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.760
 against the wall are very good genre to play 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.030
 him on the gamepad and generally mope in 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.650
 faces are better suited for deposits 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.840
 gamepads a la Xbox would be for racing 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.200
 equally suited to you but here 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.580
 again the taste and color 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.920
 I also want to mention such a thing as 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.020
 triggers or triggers in our 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.420
 This here these buttons their essence 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.900
 is that they react and to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.760
 force pressing is especially important happens in 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.620
 racing or in games days you can rule 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.380
 car this will allow you to support 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.570
 certain speed happens that 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.830
 trigger is not at all a trigger we 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.360
 only externally a substitute in essence 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.050
 are just buttons old man not 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.700
 fall for such a setup having finished 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.769
 tell about the outwardly constituting 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 these rise of functionality first 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.870
 worth knowing about such a thing as x 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.730
 input and direct input if you do not know 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 what is it rarely possible amount of it 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.380
 method of transmitting computer signals from 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.200
 gamepad their son under the newer on it 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.519
 does not mean that now you can not buy 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.430
 direct input gamepad 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.760
 so and gamepads occupy the lowest price 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.670
 category in the market should be noted that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.160
 many now use x 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.140
 input and if you are connected by vat 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.200
 directinput then what's the use of it 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.820
 absolutely 0 so this parameter 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.700
 worth learning before buying a new one 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.709
 hempad but if it starts with a lot 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.290
 smothering a toad and buying cheap imports 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.320
 without x if you have a couple of ways 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.650
 to get to work and in games where he 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.459
 I will talk about this in a separate 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.890
 Video to return to listing 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.690
 functional important factor 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.770
 is the sensitivity of analogs 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.480
 sticks and their so-called dead zone 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.620
 absolutely term means zone 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.560
 inclinations to 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.870
 in which we have this very deviation already 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.940
 no effect on sticking ability 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.490
 there are two dead zones internally and externally 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.080
 first is how fast does it start 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.780
 respond your character betrayed 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.970
 significantly deviation from the center here with 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.640
 dead zone should not be at all 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.220
 However, you have such cheap representatives. 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.190
 An unpleasant thing can also stick 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.250
 hang out on this all single case 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.410
 but also not to forget about it 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.090
 there is also an external dead zone for 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.370
 availability is also undesirable 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.120
 but let it be but not very 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.090
 more can still tell the presence 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.890
 buttons here it is the usual amount 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.669
 buttons 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.460
 It also happens like analogs 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.370
 gamepads sega mega drive 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.720
 the same can be said about the presence of vibration 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.620
 but this option is in taste and color and to someone 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.130
 choose someone you need not choose 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.870
 themselves also some gamepads have 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.419
 the adventure function can by the left 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.970
 stick and crosspiece but it is already on 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.840
 amateur as well as the backlight and 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.610
 headset jack 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.830
 now let's summarize 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.410
 first decided on the price make sure that 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.750
 You can buy this price what you want 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.639
 and then come to the choice of applicants 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.280
 began to choose the most convenient for purchase 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.449
 the form for you to look no further 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.130
 games you need a gamepad 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.770
 from this follows the arrangement of the sticks 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.300
 the presence of triggers and barney vibration if 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.190
 it requires high precision then 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.260
 find out from the sensitivity of analogs 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.900
 and about how smoothly they shrink and 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.310
 all buttons do not respond correctly 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.310
 too lazy to read reviews about 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.160
 you like manipulators in them you 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.560
 you can find out about things like that 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.840
 do not know with the price tag and the presence of backlash and 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:54.500
 squeaks into build quality and for how long 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:56.000
 you will serve your chosen one for the whole 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.410
 This video helped you decide 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.200
 choice and also brought you 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.150
 certain knowledge thanks for watching 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.130
 leave comments put big 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.789
 fingers subscribe to the channel all good luck 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.789
 until
