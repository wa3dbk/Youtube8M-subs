00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 We look like cells in a cell 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 video planting talent your counting where is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.140
 the difference seen 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.820
 Now we take an important part of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.450
 such a cell a little closer under the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.380
 Lupe and indeed the cell membrane old 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.380
 remains syndrome 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 A cell membrane looks like this 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.019
 probably the only thing I have is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 in this picture the color understands blue 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.349
 That's why we'll do it a bit 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.599
 slower but fun you are the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 Greatest and stay here are real 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.030
 class and by the way thank you for being the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.960
 watching videos 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 So here's the whole thing a bit easier 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 basic building block of the membrane is one 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.329
 double layer which consists of two 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.790
 rows of phospholipids that look 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.220
 like little male head of that 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.290
 Poor harmless Munich SC profile 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.750
 that means he gets along well with 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.080
 water it has no arms but for it 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.089
 two tails professional helga the two 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.559
 tails are hydrophobic that means they are 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.960
 can not be dissolved in water 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.519
 Salad oil, for example, is also hydrophobic 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.739
 that is why small bubbles form 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.180
 if it shakes something that comes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
 therefore it is not water 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 can mix and the tail 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.079
 it's just part of the little male 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.009
 the same in ours 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.600
 body fluids are the bulk of 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.610
 Therefore, the water consist of the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 hydrophobic tail part of the lipids of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 the liquid away the hydrophilic head 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.030
 points to the liquid because he is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.960
 yes, I can stand it well with her 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 have never been in a video so often 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.679
 By the way, by the way, youtube is four 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.939
 theoretically more or less the same 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.429
 like li prof 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.200
 So fat insoluble and then hydrophobic 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.499
 conversely, almost the same willi profile 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.210
 So fat-soluble it is roughly what 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:41.759
 I dissolve badly in water dissolves 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.929
 quite good in fat and the other way around 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.539
 clever among you already have 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.959
 noted hydro for water lipo for fat 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.289
 much for love as in pedophile and for 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.060
 repel vienna phobia flottbek in the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.009
 Membrane, however, is even more like 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.569
 we have seen above, for one are there 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.209
 many small proteins 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.069
 there are proteins only on the outside 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.939
 but the membrane does not attach firmly 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.369
 are bound 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.550
 They become peripheral membrane proteins 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.319
 called then there are lipid anchored 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.340
 The proteins are not really in 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.990
 the membrane stuck 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 but they are never profane with one 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.709
 Molecule connected that they are in, so to speak 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.680
 the lipid layer anchors the membrane 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.870
 an integral membrane protein is located 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.880
 mostly or completely in one 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.340
 or both lipid layers of the membrane 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.110
 these include proteins once 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.490
 all through the membrane throughout the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.880
 will also be transmembrane 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.160
 called protein 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.190
 Channel proteins for example are always 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.930
 transmembrane protein they are also called 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.910
 ion channels are called because they 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.680
 certain charged particles that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.900
 allow the cell to penetrate 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.700
 But not all particles need one 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.980
 ion channel to get to the cell 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.910
 therefore one calls the membrane also semi 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.890
 by mail 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.740
 because for some substances permeable 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.750
 is some smaller molecules to 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.150
 example oxygen carbon dioxide 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.190
 Alcohol or urea come without 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.260
 problems so through the membrane because they 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.660
 some of them are slightly hydrophilic 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.390
 a bit lee profil a bit bi 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.580
 never hurts so does not shut down 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.040
 necessarily per se and small molecules 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.140
 can both be larger 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.790
 This is an exclusive molecule, however 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.410
 where there are then on the profile 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.240
 in addition to nico many share 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.530
 that's what it's all about 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.990
 are distributed and what proportion 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.820
 outweighs other substances have to over 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.800
 transporter proteins or so-called 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.510
 pumps are introduced into the cell 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.830
 how that works exactly you see 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.670
 next week in our video about 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.830
 your pump 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.570
 transport some membrane proteins 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.970
 not directly in fabric but only 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.130
 signals further into the cell interior that are 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.930
 so called receptors on the cell 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.360
 outside bind signal substances 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.340
 but again back to the ion channels 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.950
 and for the first picture the one pictured here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.050
 protein with a so-called alpha elik 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.880
 structure so a spiral through 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.710
 the membrane goes just as well 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.760
 bigger molecule with profiles and 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.070
 hydrophilic part 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.170
 The spiral has a polar and a and 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.820
 cholera side being polar hydrophilic 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.800
 and and polar the profile 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.030
 Actually, such a protein would be too 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.280
 not necessarily alone in the membrane 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.590
 traveling more of them would be a 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.590
 ion channel make this protein with 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.980
 alpha helix who is an ion channel 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.900
 subunit that works in blue 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.170
 see how the hydrophilic areas the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.609
 a channel shape through it can be water 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.710
 water soluble molecules and ions in the 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.360
 inside the cell bring in the yellow ones 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.850
 areas are outward 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.890
 hydrophobic or profile and can be 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.540
 therefore good on or in the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.010
 attach double layer 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.080
 if you already learned a bit 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.280
 have us a hashtag you are welcome in 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.870
 the comments if you are just as smart 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.490
 be like two before 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.900
 hopeless but he gives himself 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.430
 not on watch a few videos and us 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.320
 then you have the overview very quickly 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.420
 complaining now helps you with it 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.560
 So what 's left in the membrane? 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.090
 we do not know yet there's one 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.500
 example cholesterol 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.060
 Cholesterol is an important one 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.220
 part of the membrane it increases the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.110
 stability because the membrane is pretty 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.300
 liquid and the cholesterol makes them 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.370
 a little start too, it can work together 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.210
 with protein substances in the cell pure and 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.130
 carry out 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.070
 so now back to the membrane 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.200
 picture looks even easier but 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.600
 then what is still there, there are still 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.090
 Everywhere these little chains belong 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.870
 to the glycoprotein and glycol lipids 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.660
 and consist of glycol nikoläuse 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.510
 Access to the glycoprotein depends on the 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.150
 sugar chains of protein at gluco 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.660
 lipids are actually lipids 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.860
 Most membrane proteins glycoprotein 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.630
 with the sugar chains always only 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.800
 outside the lipid membrane on the 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.110
 protein are attached 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.700
 I never mean that within the depot 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.700
 fell in part because the sugar namely 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.410
 hydrophilic are glycol ipi de are like 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.900
 the phospholipids also membrane 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.640
 The only ingredient is that its hydrophilic head 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.400
 contains no phosphate but just 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.110
 sugar, too, they just stuck in the 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.830
 outward show the lipid layer of the 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.110
 cell membrane 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.510
 Finally, there is on the cell side 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.310
 the membrane nor the cytoskeleton that is 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.920
 a network of protein is missing 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.750
 filamente is the name of the thread 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.460
 changeable so they stabilize the 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.250
 cell and are responsible for their movement 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.650
 responsible as the filaments 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.450
 partially attach to the cell membrane 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.640
 this is also about 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.130
 peripheral membrane proteins the 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.420
 Cell membrane is so thin 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.270
 double layer entering and exiting 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.650
 regulated by substances in the cell 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.480
 lipids are also called fats and 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.610
 therefore comes the extremely sophisticated 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.490
 video title the cell membrane of fats 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.990
 bouncer always briefly thinks it is 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.030
 already sick what i call our body 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.800
 our life depends on and 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.270
 Nevertheless, we do not get anything with it 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.430
 if you are interested in something like that 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.350
 you up to the simple biology channel to 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.570
 there are more of that weird 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.430
 hot stuff on the simple physics 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.960
 Kanal is just as insane because there 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.030
 we answer questions around the 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.680
 everyday life like why it colors 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.450
 there or how a gps works 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.450
 Thank you for watching and yes
