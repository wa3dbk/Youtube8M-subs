altitude saw them from the air and
they're<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.649> hard<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.190> except<00:00:56.520> for

they're really hard to see except for

thee from the air and I think that maybe

thee from the air and I think that maybe
one<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> reasons<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.829> they're<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> little

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
one of the reasons that they're a little

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
one of the reasons that they're a little
hard<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:01.379> they're<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.559> heavily

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hard to that they're not heavily

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.030 
hard to that they're not heavily
touristed<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.470> may<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> solution<00:01:04.680> for

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
touristed but I may have a solution for

00:01:05.040 --> 00:02:16.539 
touristed but I may have a solution for
that

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.559 

that<00:02:17.549> was<00:02:17.640> pretty<00:02:17.819> cool<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:18.269> not<00:02:18.390> sure<00:02:18.510> that

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
that was pretty cool I'm not sure that

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.190 
that was pretty cool I'm not sure that
anybody<00:02:18.840> has<00:02:19.049> ever<00:02:19.200> done<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.799> before<00:02:21.109> but<00:02:22.109> it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
anybody has ever done that before but it

00:02:22.200 --> 00:03:04.440 
anybody has ever done that before but it
gives<00:02:22.260> me<00:02:22.409> another<00:02:22.560> idea

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:14.630 

you
