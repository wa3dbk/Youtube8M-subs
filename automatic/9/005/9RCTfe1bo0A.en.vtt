to<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.570> unstoppable<00:00:30.929> there<00:00:31.740> were<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
to be unstoppable there were one of the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.610 
to be unstoppable there were one of the
top<00:00:32.340> five<00:00:32.790> defenses<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.510> year<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.469> was

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
top five defenses this year which was

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.100 
top five defenses this year which was
shocking<00:00:35.130> because<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.630> browns<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> top

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
shocking because a browns in the top

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
shocking because a browns in the top
five<00:00:37.320> defense<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.850> doesn't<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
five defense that that doesn't go with a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.440 
five defense that that doesn't go with a
what<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> NFL<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.300> our

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
what the NFL but I think they got our

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.119 
what the NFL but I think they got our
coach<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> Steelers<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.829> they're

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
coach from the Steelers that they're

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.190 
coach from the Steelers that they're
playing<00:00:44.399> almost<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:45.000> scheme<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:46.020> had

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
playing almost the same scheme they had

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
playing almost the same scheme they had
good<00:00:46.379> coverage<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.670> year<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:47.969> they

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
good coverage this year I think they

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.110 
good coverage this year I think they
were<00:00:48.300> number<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.719> ranked<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.230> pass<00:00:49.860> defense

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
were number one ranked in pass defense

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
were number one ranked in pass defense
but<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> think<00:00:51.420> EA<00:00:51.629> should<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.140> gave<00:00:52.739> him<00:00:52.829> some

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
but I think EA should have gave him some

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
but I think EA should have gave him some
credit<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.840> should<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.050> raised

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
credit a little they should have raised

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.689 
credit a little they should have raised
their<00:00:55.500> overalls<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.250> bit<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
their overalls a little bit more in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.849 
their overalls a little bit more in
defense<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.320> ridiculous

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
defense because it's just ridiculous

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.349 
defense because it's just ridiculous
Calvin<00:00:59.160> Hayden<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.000> thing<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that play so here we go guys 36 he goes

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.429 
that play so here we go guys 36 he goes
spread<00:01:32.250> often<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.329> he<00:01:33.570> decides<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> motion

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
spread often and he decides to motion

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.240 
spread often and he decides to motion
his<00:01:35.280> tight<00:01:36.030> end<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> left<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.619> he<00:01:37.740> was

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
his tight end to the left I think he was

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
his tight end to the left I think he was
going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> use<00:01:38.520> him<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> blocker<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.799> Josh

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
going to use him as a blocker and Josh

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.710 
going to use him as a blocker and Josh
