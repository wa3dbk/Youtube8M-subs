00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
know AMD GPUs run pretty hot so that is

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.000 
know AMD GPUs run pretty hot so that is
going<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.810> keep<00:03:01.990> things<00:03:02.230> nice<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.500> cool<00:03:02.830> as

flip it over this way so you can see we

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.240 
flip it over this way so you can see we
do<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:16.810> Asus<00:03:17.290> bracket<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.709> course<00:03:17.890> Asus

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
help with the stability of the card so

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.060 
help with the stability of the card so
if<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.930> sitting<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.290> your<00:03:23.350> system<00:03:23.739> which<00:03:23.860> it

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
if it is sitting in your system which it

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.850 
if it is sitting in your system which it
will<00:03:24.280> sit<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.380> your<00:03:26.500> system

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
will sit much like this in your system

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.460 
will sit much like this in your system
you<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.310> over<00:03:28.239> time<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.810> things<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.290> that

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you know over time in things like that

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.320 
you know over time in things like that
cards<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.250> tendency<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.730> droop<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
cards have a tendency to droop and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.090 
cards have a tendency to droop and
things<00:03:32.019> like<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.709> will<00:03:32.860> keep<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
things like that so this will keep the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.640 
things like that so this will keep the
card<00:03:33.340> nice<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.180> flush<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:35.170> course<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.500> does

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
card nice and flush of course it does

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.500 
card nice and flush of course it does

I'm<00:03:50.380> not<00:03:50.530> sure<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.830> can<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.160> but<00:03:51.370> there

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
I'm not sure if you can see but there

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.540 
I'm not sure if you can see but there
are<00:03:51.640> actually<00:03:51.910> little<00:03:52.750> LEDs<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.590> there<00:03:53.920> which

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
are actually little LEDs on there which

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.190 
are actually little LEDs on there which
will<00:03:54.760> show<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.000> if<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.239> have<00:03:55.450> power<00:03:55.690> or<00:03:55.870> not

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
will show you if you have power or not

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.750 
will show you if you have power or not
so<00:03:56.410> maybe<00:03:56.620> you're<00:03:56.769> having<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:57.010> power<00:03:57.190> problem

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
so maybe you're having a power problem

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.490 
so maybe you're having a power problem
or<00:03:57.880> something<00:03:58.720> like<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.230> power

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
or something like that you have power

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.280 
or something like that you have power
indicators<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.610> let<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.239> if<00:04:01.540> you're<00:04:02.260> not

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
indicators to let you know if you're not

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.620 
indicators to let you know if you're not
getting<00:04:02.680> power<00:04:02.860> to<00:04:03.250> your<00:04:03.850> video<00:04:04.269> card<00:04:04.540> of
