00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.699
 we have slept 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.699
 in this case we trust 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.309
 we went out 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.009

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.050
 none of this is what we said where it says 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.150
 this origin 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.279

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150

 my team did not give us where it was needed 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.369
 seitaridis and the perfect chrono 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:10.150

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
 the codes correctly can not be performed 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.050

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.580
 start maximum 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.740
 finally this option 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:38.349
 the st fernando 

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.029
 in this way the web says 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:44.360
 hector that we will comment can leave 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.149
