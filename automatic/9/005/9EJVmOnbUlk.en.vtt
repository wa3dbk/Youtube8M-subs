350 d so if you're familiar with that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
350 d so if you're familiar with that
you<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.610> features<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.270> along

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.340 
with it it's a it's a micro ATX style
case<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.949> guess<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> front

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
case I guess I really do like the front

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.049 
case I guess I really do like the front
of<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> looks

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of it I do not like the way it looks

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
of it I do not like the way it looks
when<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:57.660> install<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.500> optical

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
when you actually install an optical

when you actually install an optical
drive<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.609> there's<00:00:59.789> nothing<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.210> Origen

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
drive here there's nothing really Origen

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
drive here there's nothing really Origen
could<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.859> other<00:01:02.190> than<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.910> put

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
could do about that other than not put

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
could do about that other than not put
an<00:01:03.239> optical<00:01:03.600> drive<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.960> may<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.680> good

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
an optical drive which may not be a good

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.600 
an optical drive which may not be a good
option<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> lot<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> users<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.610> think

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
option for a lot of users but I think

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.080 
option for a lot of users but I think
