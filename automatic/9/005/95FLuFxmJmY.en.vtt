00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.480
 sun 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.770
 There have been many changes in the Spanish league and also many rumors 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.129
 we go first for the changes 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.780
 a couple of weeks ago the Spanish changed coach 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.810
 vino pochettino and recently also its last in the last signings 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.410
 He quoted them to Real Madrid 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.939
 the last hour the betis with oliveira 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.159
 but also this week 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.309
 it has been announced the institution had been clear that it was an unavoidable fact 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:35.159
 2008 was phenomenal and especially in the last quarter because there is lost it 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.560
 a game the athletic madrid to almost 15 games without losing 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.309
 but in 2009 I was in free fall I was not able to link 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.430
 a victory was announced to hype and saucer 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.660
 but if what has surprised us is a little 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.710
 has been his substitute nothing more and nothing less than abel resino is 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.560
 an exjugador and especially because it was a fact 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.300
 that the truth is that we are not used to seeing what there is 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.299
 coach goalkeeper 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.039
 comes from castellón was in sixth place doing very good campaign 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.520
 church ahead 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.780
 for the greater the greater success the greater of the lots to if it is lucky and in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.890
 chirp something madrid 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.790
 to come back 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.700
 target the champions and get a position in group of miners will renew 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.479
 automatically and the rumors go by the rumors there is a rumor that they say 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.409
 that the athleti 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.420
 of bilbao does not want to play 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.060
 the valence that prefers the style that is 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.560
 the field of bernabéu 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.990
 why 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.630
 other than it catches you much more than the case of coughing an entry problem has 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 surprised a bit the demand to the fans demand is commented the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.929
 fear that almost 80 thousand people want an entrance for that end 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.830
 it's a fact that he used to play for a long time. Guardiola plays 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.390
 the last time was 25 years ago 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.729
 people want to remember that gift of the king of drinks and want to go back to 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.750
 madrid - speculates that a final barsa madrid that was the one that starred in 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.729
 the year 84 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.789
 then people are a little anxious they have many tickets of which has 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.340
 capacity 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.399
 valencia and last rumor also that villa goes to the barsa 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.300
 who has chosen 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.609
 the Catalan team 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:14.039
 the truth is that the base is seeing a few pitches and planning a bit 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.859
 the season 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.749
 2009 and 2010 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.739
 it is said that he is in the market soon 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.120
 although he has a contract that approves the sale in total and has a contract but I know 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.510
 if you renew it will not renew 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.329
 but what is taken for granted 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.599
 is that the barsa looking for a striker started with benzema the shots but for 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.689
 thousand has always been to the illusion a bit the main objective since 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.360
 much time of tafalla two or three years as speculated that 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.119
 they also wanted silva so we'll see if these rumors at the end 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.489
 fulfill 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.269
 but we are going to the subject that interests us to the subject of the bets we have chosen for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:47.869
 today 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.419
 all the Andalusian teams of two derbies very interesting the money the 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.509
 seville betis 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.790
 it would be accurate that the screen is tactile you can check 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.229
 An 83 victory for Sevilla 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.909
 3 20 the tie 4 20 in the victory against the betis the truth and complicated 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.700
 but what do you want me to tell you that day is very strong but the betis 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.039
 at the last minute oliveira file complicated situation 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.449
 and I fancy 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.779
 It's interesting that it costs him a lot to earn at home that day. 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:15.930
 make a goal so 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.460
 why not a draw a tie that would be paid 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.859
 to 3 20 we did not receive either for Sevilla or for the betis draw at 3 20 and Málaga 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.150
 the málaga almería 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.459
 1 91 the victory of málaga 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.819
 3 20 the tie and 3 and telecinco the victory of the almería a málaga that 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.449
 take off the revelation team along with the sport 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.059
 of this season being superbly fine another day he could not score points in 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.099
 debate in bilbao 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.479
 but they had against the ropes 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.050
 but since he arrived quite 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.860
 the almería has worked very well so I also very little to look for the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.860
 surprise I will try to find the surprise 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:57.339
 look for a little the victory of the almeria pressure of five a tie 3 20 either 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.500
 it would be not bad 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.129
 it would be a benefit or succulent so 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.529
 dedicated a bit by the visitors is the bid manager for the betis and for the 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:11.039
 almería I will take until here you have Protestantism 2006 all the parties 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.830
 and all the possibilities that you have 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.230
 to be able to make many bets 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.329
 do not give us next week
