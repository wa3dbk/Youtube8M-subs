I'm<00:04:40.719> guessing<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.169> isn't<00:04:41.379> popular<00:04:41.710> I've<00:04:42.039> got

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
I'm guessing this isn't popular I've got

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.830 
I'm guessing this isn't popular I've got
another<00:04:42.370> I've<00:04:43.000> got<00:04:43.180> another<00:04:43.330> bag<00:04:43.569> we're<00:04:43.719> gonna

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840

another I've got another bag we're gonna
do<00:04:44.080> another<00:04:44.949> video<00:04:45.159> I'm<00:04:45.340> gonna<00:04:45.430> do<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:45.699> a<00:04:45.759> few

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
do another video I'm gonna do in a few

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.990 
do another video I'm gonna do in a few
days<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:47.189> there<00:04:48.189> are<00:04:48.310> more<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.550> these<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.789> here

so<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.240> guess<00:04:49.449> I'm<00:04:49.629> guessing<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.020> LEGO

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
so I guess I'm guessing that LEGO

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.559 
so I guess I'm guessing that LEGO
Friends<00:04:50.740> event<00:04:51.159> wasn't<00:04:51.789> very<00:04:52.000> popular<00:04:52.180> I'm

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569
