00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.920
 I'm putting it wrong to see if this one is worth 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.960
 gale rhyming with metal metal metal 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.300
 true that takes good shot that rhymes with 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 metal then what they do are worth and there 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.789
 one guitar solo cojonudos the editor 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.770

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.700
 good heavy metal spanish 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.720
 today says the following many 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.370
 you ask me hey hey I can 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.930
 give my friends guitarists nothing 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.610
 do not notice in the pota idea because to 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.890
 give him something you have to know him good 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.810
 so if I'm going to tell you what I do not 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.010
 you must never give a vitalist 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.930
 because because we have a lot of 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.700
 friends including either Christmas or 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.650
 be on birthdays or such that with 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.170
 you know with the excuse of saying what they are 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.000
 They are guitar players and such and such as 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.560
 anything is worth it or you'll see what 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.690
 it will be this and I will not spend a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.250
 future damn rake had the vale 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 we are people like everyone you have to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.330
 to know each other we gain what we have then 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.710
 I will recommend what not to give here 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.720
 I have a gift box that 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.700
 apparently it may seem like one thing 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.050
 great because it's full of shit and 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.050
 whitman cacumen january 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:02.730
 and let's see how good the first thing 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.980
 has given me this has been 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.720
 that batch of your ace of texts from the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.740
 rival Chinese you're worth two euros and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.110
 show you by the throne 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.910
 do not give that fucking shit because I use 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.500
 a number a concrete measure ok 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.670
 then law number projects to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.040
 give me my friend who plays the guitar 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.600
 Take it, not because it's not good 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.600
 then that first thing the second 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.930
 another good thing then it's it's soap with 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:39.290
 guitar shape receive permission in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:39.290
 pig that is never good if you figure 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.540
 Then there is also 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.250
 this is a slide but it is not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 any is a slide that is worth very little 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.840
 very cheap, that is, if I do not play blues with him 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.580
 already the friend who goes and buys 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.959
 Roman is worth the cheapest strings that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.610
 find but do not realize that it puts 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.610
 more and leave you to the four work 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:16.700
 after this age or the typical gift 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:19.280
 of the specific a friend more rat 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.290
 although he gives you a preview of verbatim 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.000
 vouchers of yours with double cd voucher 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.739
 with one of your performances that neither 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.730
 has even made a good point 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.310
 then it is to this yes effectively 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.120
 the delayed book 27 is very important 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.120
 so that always 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.610
 you can die at 27 and if you have more 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.140
 or you're always there on the board 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.989
 a note that says to be near the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.519
 original good after this other's 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.709
 the rat friends that what he does is 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.610
 Giving you your own photos is worth it if you 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:56.799
 give your photos of when I was a kid 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.769
 good when you think that because you think you are 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.510
 an electric guitarist because he gives you 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.510
 the notices and there is a solfeggio book 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.229
 It's the typical key strap the strap goes 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.359
 of the transport belt line as if 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.340
 you were a punch, you have all the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.020
 the world was going to move others 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.090
 If you do not put it on, it happens that we do 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.130
 that goal that gets bad really bad 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 well, give us a gift is something that is 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.780
 staff and that normally does not have 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.210
 why like it because for example 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.530
 well, it's really the ball of 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.630
 exercises so that you get to have 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.860
 normal strength at times do not be the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.470
 better than it is seen in the world the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.570
 good twist shit and nothing else these are 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.010
 gifts that I indigenous a lot worth 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.389
 because they are gifts that you should not do 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.229
 when I wanted to give something to someone 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.790
 some friend 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.340
 think about what exactly it is that 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.660
 like it because not because I play the guitar 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.130
 it's a guitar gift molano not the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.300
 has or whatever so nothing else 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.760
 I hope that this blockade has 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.229
 fun has served you many
