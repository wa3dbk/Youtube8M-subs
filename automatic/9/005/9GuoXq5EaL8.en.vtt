it's<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:36.540> lucky<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.620> didn't

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it's pretty lucky because I didn't

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
it's pretty lucky because I didn't
actually<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:38.520> ahead<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
actually have to go ahead and do all of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.940 
actually have to go ahead and do all of
them<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.870> only<00:00:40.050> did<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.559> Guardians

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
them I only did up two Guardians

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
them I only did up two Guardians
crossing<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> plus<00:00:43.230> version

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
crossing and to do the plus version

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.959 
crossing and to do the plus version
normally<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.430> had<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.820> all

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
normally you would have had to go all

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.310 
normally you would have had to go all
the<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> kingdom<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> darkness

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the way up to the kingdom of darkness

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
the way up to the kingdom of darkness
and<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.460> takes<00:00:47.640> way<00:00:47.879> too<00:00:47.910> long<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and that just takes way too long of the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
and that just takes way too long of the
plus<00:00:49.020> version<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.469> an<00:00:49.559> armor<00:00:50.010> without<00:00:50.670> even

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
plus version of an armor without even

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.900 
plus version of an armor without even
having<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> open<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.750> chest<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:53.699> means

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
having to open a chest for it that means

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
having to open a chest for it that means
that<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> did<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> heroic<00:00:54.780> mode<00:00:55.610> actually<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that you did the heroic mode actually I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.799 
that you did the heroic mode actually I
think<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> only<00:00:57.270> way<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think that's like the only way to get a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.590 
think that's like the only way to get a
plus<00:00:58.370> I'm<00:00:59.370> pretty<00:00:59.670> sure<00:01:00.000> there's<00:01:00.180> another<00:01:00.210> way

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
plus I'm pretty sure there's another way

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.189 
plus I'm pretty sure there's another way
but<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:01.640> don't<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> full<00:01:03.899> water

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
theories took a long time so I got lots

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.979 
theories took a long time so I got lots
of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.280> stuff<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.599> we're<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> go<00:02:19.959> ahead

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
of the stuff so we're going to go ahead

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.400 
of the stuff so we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:20.110> craft<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.650> bunch<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.980> these<00:02:21.190> things<00:02:22.410> which

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and craft a bunch of these things which

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.320 
and craft a bunch of these things which
is<00:02:23.560> cool<00:02:23.800> they'll<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.220> done<00:02:24.400> like<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.849> day<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.269> a

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
is cool they'll be done like a day and a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.800 
is cool they'll be done like a day and a
half<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:25.959> two<00:02:26.170> days<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.269> yeah<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.629> that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
half or two days and yeah so that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.120 
half or two days and yeah so that
basically<00:02:29.050> sums<00:02:29.410> up<00:02:29.650> for<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.860> rest<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
basically sums up for the rest of the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.280 
basically sums up for the rest of the
episode<00:02:30.660> I'm<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.840> need<00:02:31.900> some<00:02:31.959> water
