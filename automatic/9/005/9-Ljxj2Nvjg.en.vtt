00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.180
 java-script citizens want with a 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.250
 new green lightning 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.230
 I show you today is correct 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 vehicles the politician to money 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.770
 can do whatever you need to do it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.169
 You need a meager bob and a 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.300
 buddy the cargo bock finds her completely 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.890
 right here on this map and indeed 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.239
 here at the location the hospital 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.880
 only then a few stairs up 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.370
 climb and yes then you need 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 two more apartments in one house 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 So two garages in a house in the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.429
 upper is the panther and the garage 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 is full and in the bottom is the 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.829
 garage full and some energy or 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.499
 rusty rebel is so you go in the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 upper garage your buddy climbs like 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.940
 The top right corner is in the cargo 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.789
 bob a so you are now in pankow 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.309
 and drive out the buddy with the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.890
 Cargo Bob will now be the panther 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.870
 pick it up so that it takes us away 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.990
 theoretically so I can transport 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.760
 May now put the panther down 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.250
 a buddy takes that so now takes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.070
 Now with the account he flies 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.300
 about the golf course people show that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.160
 I'll take you around here now 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.630
 because from there you can touchpad 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.440
 push and personal vehicle 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.210
 request 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.000
 you have to wait so long now 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.860
 request personal vehicle free 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 as well as press her now 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.280
 then delivery is on the way and you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.980
 Run into the garage from where the panther 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 So came in the top of the panto must be in 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.760
 the upper garage that is real 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.940
 important and right above you can see 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.100
 that buddy must wait now so you 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.900
 get into your vehicle once 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.580
 Now you will realize that you 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.350
 You can not get out of it 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.140
 but stop the vehicle for the time being 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.270
 so if you sat in there then put 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.470
 you are rising to yours 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.600
 bicycle stand you need of course 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.940
 also a bike or in bmx depending on 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.250
 new buddy throws off your car now 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.840
 and you press right button of the panto 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.399
 or the vehicle what youtube 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.379
 Leeds wants her disappears 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.769
 a blow as well as right seen above 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.330
 So now you are driving with the bmx again 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.280
 back to the garage 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.170
 Now your character will be so funny 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.800
 Bake that you will see now 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.140
 so 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.200
 he'll be fine with you right now 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.210
 you have seen turn around for a short time 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.140
 Now you take the panther again and ask 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.080
 get him out again 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.180
 Your buddy fucks you again with 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.050
 the cargo bob and fly back to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.140
 golf course 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.200
 but this time he does something different 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.330
 but that will come right now so pick us 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.040
 Starting from people really have to be careful with 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.900
 the peck so that there are no accidents 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.240
 happen because cargo bob is allowed during the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.700
 do not go broke because otherwise 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.520
 It takes that you look for the one again and 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.480
 and so if you miss it, that's it 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.790
 not so bad 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.030
 and if you do not understand the video 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.680
 Look at you guys several times before 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.450
 the comments write that to you 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.520
 do not go and let's try it 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.990
 to get that lucky 106 would have 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.170
 I would be really happy 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.340
 So let's see if we can do it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.230
 so my buddy is now trying the tank 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.560
 Of course it is also possible to capture here 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.560
 heavy 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:30.970
 so it will fly back to now 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.770
 golf course back there and you are waiting now 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.390
 again as long as her personal 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.280
 then request vehicle can press 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.510
 You request and go back to the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.840
 garage intestine or armor ago came so day 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.300
 says the mechanic iks now 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.340
 the delivery moment is said so 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.560
 delivery on the way to the garage 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.300
 or armor came now waiting for yours 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.390
 Buddy is staying there all the time 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.880
 with the account over the golf course to her 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 you drove out so you are stuck 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.680
 in the account and just drive out 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.959
 so super easy as you see 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.220
 can you wait at options my buddy 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.500
 until I went out 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.030
 he sees me, I'm outside and now 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.480
 he can come to us in front 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.580
 Now your buddy must be passive 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.070
 mode that is the type of where in the 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.200
 cargo bob seat must be in passive mode 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.850
 go because you have to get the vehicle now 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.000
 To create we sink on the map 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.770
 is displayed that the panther on the cargo 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.330
 bob still a personal conclusion is what 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.040
 actually very funny 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.920
 usually that does not happen 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.690
 so my buddy is now in passive mode 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.630
 I'm taking a grenade or after 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:52.330
 bomb and throw against the panto with it 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:53.950
 everything explodes so clearly i have it 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.450
 destroyed now there is still that 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.880
 it put a personal vehicle 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.860
 Now I'll call Leicester for a while 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.430
 My mum goes away again 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.000
 Of course, all that flies to the golf course is not 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.600
 So I go back to the golf course I call 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.010
 leaves short 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.570
 he settles everything so my buddy goes 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.910
 now to the golf course so on 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.290
 golf course is people i pick up my cellphone 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.270
 Ross a year taken cell phone out like that 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.340
 Just right people before you get the phone 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.170
 you have to get out of your once 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.510
 vehicle off aboard again 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.280
 that is very important that that 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.750
 this tank on the keyboard is not more than 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.790
 personal vehicle is displayed 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.890
 so now let the tires spin and 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.090
 call me at mmos medium and leave your 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.760
 request a vehicle 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.900
 Now you go personal on touchpad 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.610
 request a vehicle 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.290
 you are now driving in with the panther 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.180
 other full garage 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.510
 that does not mean the original one 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.240
 garage as soon as you have a vehicle 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.000
 replaced by your buddy throws the 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.160
 panther denner because he has down there 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.750
 so you will now right above 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.960
 I have now replaced the panther 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.880
 my buddy throws the panther now goes 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.650
 you go back to the standard 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.600
 Garage that means in the garage where I am 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.160
 before so where the panther came from 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.750
 I am now from what it in my job 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.670
 circle rhine gone that's really stupid 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.830
 I had to remove that is 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:20.110
 really fucked up there so moment 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:26.680
 Now I go to the garage in there where 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:30.610
 the panther originally came in forth 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.800
 So here's the panto at the very beginning 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.180
 the panto must come from the top of the 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.220
 upper garage and must be in the lower one 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.720
 and then later in here you can 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.669
 there is a panther on each 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.800
 if you take that and then you can 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.840
 the sale unfortunately overcomes this 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.520
 Glitsch not the 45 minutes waiting time 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.000
 but of course think that's not 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.710
 problem 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.479
 Basically it was already 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.039
 from me as I said people look at you 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.600
 please the video several times 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.800
 if you do not understand it is 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.840
 really a complicated matter 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.000
 but as soon as you understand it will be 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.009
 that will be this lightning as well as you 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.560
 that within five minutes always 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.940
 he can definitely perform people 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.150
 I would be really happy if we did 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.130
 106 could get on this video 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.130
 and yes I would say skin 3
