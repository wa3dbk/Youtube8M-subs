 hello friends today I will teach you how 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:11.299
 how to have two minecraft at a time 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.379
 works with the pirate and with the original 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.620
 either of them in the same 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.810
 same good function let's start first 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.810
 what they have to do is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.730
 is to create a folder I'm going to put 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.730
 the name of minecraft ah 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.829
 and to put another name that we open and here 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.360
 put we write 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.730
 min 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.270
 and we want another folder called 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 data 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.510
 in order to go when running the game what 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 what do we do 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 we copy the shortcut here 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.930
 here we have 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.880
 good yes yes decide in the main class sp 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.940
 well I have changed the name if you 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.759
 says so that the name is changed 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.600
 put minecraft alone but if not not 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.600
 will be good here in data 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.619
 can you copy the folder that 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.619
 is it so 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 running 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 minecraft each point such as 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.700
 register users user app date 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.010
 roaming is raised between percent jackpots 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.440
 at the beginning because with a hidden folder 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.440
 you are not in this direction 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 11 in my case only 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630
 I 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.030
 in my case in my case update the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.380
 new to the main staff to have a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.700
 clean folder without any 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.660
 good then 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.830
 good sorry I made I had to cut the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.010
 video because I made the same mistake but 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.750
 here in bing such executable all everything 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.750
 same in that aimed more the kraft 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.170
 everything is the same so now we are going 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 to create a new text document 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.080
 my right new text document 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.950
 and what they have to do is 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.849
 will copy this text what leaves a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.849
 description of the video 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.190
 And the worst 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.190
 to save as 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.150
 craft point to point it has to be 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.150
 because if it is not going to walk 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.810
 and we erase it 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.400
 then I do not create this file 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.400
 we execute it 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 It is done 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.069
