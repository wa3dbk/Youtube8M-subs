00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.460
 in today's vocational tutorial job 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
 I give you a special attachment 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.960
 knot in front of very often at work 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 rope use finds the mast litter is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.750
 the fixing point freely accessible 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 you can use a laid knot 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.449
 The first loop will be behind the rope 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 placed 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:41.250
 the second loop called for the two 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.289
 be against each other grinding 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.200
 now superimposed from behind the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.899
 placed knots can now on 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.860
 attachment points are attached 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.920
 this is the example of one 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 Rabbiners demonstrates we can do that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.530
 but also about one 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 post 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 important here is that both loop 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.500
 close together so that the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.460
 knots can not solve unintentionally 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.320
 This will secure the loose ropes 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 by a half blow or as in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.220
 this example by import stitch 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 the fixing point is done 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.200
 not freely accessible is the inserted 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.680
 Mast used before the rope becomes first 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.159
 over the attachment points over the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.310
 rope and again over the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.210
 attachment points subsequently placed 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.040
 the rope will end 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.040
 pulled through the resulting loop 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.880
 Also this attachment knot will be in 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.120
 this example by import stitch 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.040
 secured the most litter can also as 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.330
 fastening knot for material and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.330
 be used tool
