00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and while riding up the tea bar I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
and while riding up the tea bar I
fantasize<00:01:54.329> about<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.630> reverse<00:01:55.049> gravity<00:01:55.409> suit

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
fantasize about a reverse gravity suit

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
fantasize about a reverse gravity suit
that<00:01:56.219> when<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> turn<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:56.939> would<00:01:57.180> let<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that when you turn it on would let you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.200 
that when you turn it on would let you
ride<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.229> mountain<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> then<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> realized

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
ride up the mountain but then I realized

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
ride up the mountain but then I realized
that<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.509> reversing<00:02:01.049> gravity<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.619> would

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that by reversing gravity you would

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.230 
that by reversing gravity you would
actually<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.250> fall<00:02:02.490> straight<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.969> into<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
actually just fall straight up into the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.760 
actually just fall straight up into the
sky<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.869> never<00:02:04.170> mind

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
sky so never mind
