00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello and welcome to the labs 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.080
 Uruguay or Uruguay we will focus on 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.969
 cleaning the tires I'm going to 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.419
 use the new wheel cleaner and 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.889
 tires uruguay is platinum with wax 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.170
 this is a formulation with high 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.970
 alkaline content that is perfect for 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.950
 dissolve a lot of dust from 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.130
 brake like pollutants 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.420
 coffee color coming out of the tire 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.080
 helping its dissolution so that the 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.670
 tire look like new and shiny 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.129
 what I'm going to do now is saturate the 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.350
 tire with our cleaner and since 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.320
 we have some dirty fenders 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.839
 I will also clean up once the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.460
 car is newly detailed make sure 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.989
 Concentrate on all areas 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.749
 complex of the tire and the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.730
 fenders so that your car looks very 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:51.190
 all right 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 then they will start to see the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.590
 brown waste formation 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.809
 This is the part that allows you to penetrate 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.180
 rubber and dissolve much of the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.699
 brake dust and those contaminants from 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.199
 the sides of the tire this will make the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.530
 rubber and the black color of their 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.690
 tires look like new the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.790
 cleaner wheels and tires plan 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.190
 It comes with wax so after 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.250
 clean and rinse your tires these 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.050
 will have an excellent brightness so if 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.759
 they do not like it to look so bright 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.729
 this is the product that will work 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.289
 for you now you'll have to wait 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.259
 30 seconds for this product 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.050
 penetrate and we're going to pretend that this 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.910
 tire was very, very dirty and 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.350
 that we are going to use a brush to help 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.690
 to eliminate a lot of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 pollutants then all that 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.880
 you have to do now since the Olympia 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.520
 this is rinse it and you can see the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.860
 black residue come out and our 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.170
 fenders are ready well cleaned 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.330
 the cleaning of the tires is not so 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 difficult just follow a routine 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.550
 regular making sure to follow the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.920
 following 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.670
 and will have two perfect tires 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.670
