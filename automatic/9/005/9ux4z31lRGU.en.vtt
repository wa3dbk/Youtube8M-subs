the movements are pretty there's a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
the movements are pretty there's a
slight<00:01:40.950> delay<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.700> enough<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.299> make<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
slight delay but not enough to make it

control<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:26.640> with<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.790> touchscreen<00:02:27.120> even

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
control it with a touchscreen even

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.819

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
though it does have profiles that you

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.150
