important thing is you need to have no
chain<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:39.780> go

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
chain you just have to just really go

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
chain you just have to just really go
for<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.590> know<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> more<00:01:42.240> embarrassing

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
for it you know the more embarrassing

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.270 
for it you know the more embarrassing
and<00:01:42.930> stupid<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.649> snapchat<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and stupid you are on snapchat the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
and stupid you are on snapchat the
better<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.700> once<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> they

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
better because once they look at it they

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.740 
better because once they look at it they
can't<00:01:46.740> save<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.250> there's<00:01:47.369> no<00:01:47.520> proof<00:01:47.790> this

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
can't save it so there's no proof this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.510 
can't save it so there's no proof this
is<00:01:48.899> probably<00:01:49.140> why<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.380> Christie's<00:01:50.009> snapchats
