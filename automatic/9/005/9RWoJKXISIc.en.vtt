00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.990
 never as in these years the technology of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 lighting of our cars yes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.980
 developments have been evolved 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.380
 all faces swift and incredible 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 to increase active safety 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.400
 the world of racing both on the road and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 on the track it has always been the engine 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.990
 main of this research because i 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 riders especially in rallies and in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 Endurance races need to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 huge amounts of light due to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.420
 the history of lights is very strong 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 car started 100 years ago 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
 with the first incandescent bulbs 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.739
 from the warm light but little effective beyond 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 70 percent go away in the form of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.510
 heat the transition to halogen gas 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 together with the complex parables it improves 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 a lot of efficiency and distribution 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 of the light beam but the turning point is 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.910
 arrived a few years ago with diodes 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.070
 luminous LEDs that look like the egg of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 colombo have a pure white light 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.960
 they consume very little energy and last 10 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.329
 times more than normal lamps e 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.460
 today even the LEDs evolve with the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.860
 intelligent matrices no longer headlights 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.990
 dipped beam but a grid 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.360
 of luminous diodes that change shape a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.030
 depending on the area to be illuminated or 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.890
 presence of other cars but already outlines 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 a new frontier in this field 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 that of laser light a system 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 complex and also very expensive but that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.850
 double the depth of vision 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.530
 night 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.530
 let's see if it really works 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 aboard the r8 of course yes 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 appreciates the sound when driving 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.820
 the powerful engine the steering wheel 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.409
 small immediate response but us 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 what matters this evening e 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.820
 drive for the first time in the night 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.490
 a car with revolutionary headlights 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 laser headlights look like the ideal evening 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 for our test because there is even 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 a little bit of fog in front of us and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.530
 let's see if the laser headlights are capable of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.540
 also counter this scourge of 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.510
 padana plain that in November it was 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.280
 presented quite often 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.200
 and that marches us in a column together with 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.690
 other cars on a normal road 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.580
 we appreciate the low beam headlights that 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.890
 illuminate the edge very evenly 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.420
 of the road indeed given a good emphasis to 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.670
 those that are just the sides where 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.950
 pedestrians normally meet 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.570
 or the cyclists and therefore an area that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 can be dangerous just for the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.740
 objects that you don't see the technique of 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.870
 LED laser adds to this possibility 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.290
 the enormous power of these rays of light 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.080
 blinding almost blue white I am 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.720
 much, much more capable of penetrating 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 the darkness than normal people are 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.390
 led lights 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.550
 this means greater security 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.680
 active means more visibility in 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.930
 conditions of darkness means being able to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.450
 notice the obstacles before 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.340
 these are too close to be able to do so 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 avoiding means above all being 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.500
 also seen from afar and also in 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.610
 poor lighting conditions 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.470
 what street lighting 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.300
 or in bad condition of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.459
 visibility like rain with fog 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.170
 it really means being able to push the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.650
 own look much farther than the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.570
 others 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.640
 the laser leds however for reasons of 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.570
 security only work to certain 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.610
 conditions 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.380
 no traffic around and speed that 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.600
 exceeds 70 kilometers per hour 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.330
 I will soon leave the highway and have me 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.860
 said they were in the country road 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.110
 completely dark where they should not 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.760
 be there other cars this me 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.860
 will allow you to do tests 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.010
 comparing the dazzling release the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.409
 dazzling beam of this r 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.870
 we are on the straight you see 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.099
 how profoundly you succeed 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.920
 to see in front of us 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.840
 five hundred and six hundred meters of view 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.060
 in practice with the traffic that beats 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920
 our streets laser lights look like a 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.900
 as a technological show by 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.760
 very high level but not very usable 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.069
 at a price that will probably be 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.019
 close to 10 thousand euros 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.739
 but now you know that they exist and how 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.659
 work 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.220
 all the details you find them on 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.109
 four wheels in January 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.689
 the thing that jumps most to the eye in 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.019
 Absolute is the ability to absorb 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.489
 bumps and let's say the dips 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.099
 nice practice but also fashionable and 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.659
 fun today we will try it together 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.859
 in the hills around turin and in 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.859
 city ​​center we go
