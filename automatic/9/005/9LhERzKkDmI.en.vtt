to<00:01:07.220> partial<00:01:07.729> slat<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:09.170> from<00:01:09.410> partial

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
to partial slat and then from partial

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.820 
to partial slat and then from partial
slat<00:01:10.070> we<00:01:10.250> went<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.580> total<00:01:10.940> slatted<00:01:11.830> operation

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.749 
with total confinement the doll's family
also<00:01:16.700> grew<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.270> evolved<00:01:17.780> while<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.350> farm

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759

our finishing barns are Curtin style
barns<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.650> ventilation<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.400> there

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
barns and so the ventilation on there

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.140 
barns and so the ventilation on there
works<00:01:47.910> as<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.190> pit<00:01:50.460> fans<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:51.030> are

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
works as you have to pit fans that are

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.740 
works as you have to pit fans that are
your<00:01:51.390> number<00:01:52.020> one<00:01:52.050> variable<00:01:52.740> speed<00:01:53.070> fans<00:01:53.400> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
your number one variable speed fans and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
your number one variable speed fans and
when<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> gets<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.110> little<00:01:55.380> too<00:01:55.560> warm<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.070> them

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
when it gets a little too warm for them

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
when it gets a little too warm for them
there's<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.120> more<00:01:57.330> fans<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.870> kick<00:01:58.050> on<00:01:58.230> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
there's two more fans that kick on and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.920 
there's two more fans that kick on and
then<00:01:58.950> there's<00:01:59.220> two<00:01:59.700> wall<00:01:59.970> fans<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.540> kick<00:02:00.720> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then there's two wall fans that kick on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.510 
then there's two wall fans that kick on
it<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.590> gets<00:02:01.680> too<00:02:01.920> warm<00:02:02.190> for<00:02:02.250> those

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it and when it gets too warm for those

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
it and when it gets too warm for those
wall<00:02:02.730> fans<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.870> our<00:02:04.050> curtains<00:02:04.650> go<00:02:05.190> down<00:02:05.370> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
wall fans then our curtains go down and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
wall fans then our curtains go down and
then<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.170> temperature<00:02:07.620> still<00:02:07.890> keeps

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
then if the temperature still keeps

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
then if the temperature still keeps
rising<00:02:08.430> they're<00:02:08.820> circulating<00:02:09.300> fans<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
rising they're circulating fans on the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.190 
rising they're circulating fans on the
ceilings<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.770> kick<00:02:11.010> in<00:02:11.190> yawn<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.150> at<00:02:12.600> 86

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
ceilings that kick in yawn that at 86

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
ceilings that kick in yawn that at 86
degrees<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.610> sprinkler<00:02:15.000> system

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
degrees right now the sprinkler system

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.060 
degrees right now the sprinkler system
comes<00:02:15.630> on<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.110> pig<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> environment

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
comes on for the pig so the environment

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.250 
comes on for the pig so the environment
for<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.280> pigs<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.760> totally<00:02:18.510> controlled<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
for the pigs is totally controlled and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.580 
for the pigs is totally controlled and
and<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.280> pig<00:02:20.940> comfort<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.540> excellent<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.290> get

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and the pig comfort is excellent I get

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.100 
and the pig comfort is excellent I get
that<00:02:22.710> question<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:24.360> how<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.690> your<00:02:24.840> pigs

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that question of well how are your pigs

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.530 
that question of well how are your pigs
handling<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.710> heat<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.160> guess<00:02:26.790> my<00:02:26.970> answer<00:02:27.000> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
handling this heat I guess my answer is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.380 
handling this heat I guess my answer is
just<00:02:27.870> fine<00:02:28.460> although<00:02:29.460> they've<00:02:29.700> been<00:02:29.730> farming

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
just fine although they've been farming

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.270 
just fine although they've been farming
for<00:02:30.450> nearly<00:02:30.900> four<00:02:31.140> decades<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.890> dolls

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
for nearly four decades the dolls

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.550 
for nearly four decades the dolls
continuously<00:02:33.240> try<00:02:33.600> new<00:02:33.840> techniques<00:02:34.350> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
continuously try new techniques and

electrostatic particulate ionization to
keep<00:02:50.040> dust<00:02:50.310> down<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.790> their<00:02:50.940> barns<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.020> it's

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
keep dust down in their barns and it's

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.410 
keep dust down in their barns and it's
basically<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:52.920> an<00:02:53.310> electrical<00:02:53.760> charge<00:02:54.060> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
basically just an electrical charge that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.750 
basically just an electrical charge that
is<00:02:54.900> driven<00:02:55.410> through<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> line<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.430> these

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
is driven through a line and these

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.090 
is driven through a line and these
little<00:02:57.390> these<00:02:57.660> are<00:02:57.959> called<00:02:58.200> corona<00:02:58.620> points

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
little these are called corona points

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340 
little these are called corona points
and<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> does<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.600> ionizes<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.230> air

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and what it does is it ionizes the air

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.500 
and what it does is it ionizes the air
and<00:03:01.770> takes<00:03:02.100> over<00:03:02.310> 50%<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.209> dust<00:03:03.420> particles
