this field knocked down I guess I'm

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.060 
this field knocked down I guess I'm
actually<00:02:23.440> almost<00:02:23.890> half<00:02:24.550> maybe<00:02:25.240> not<00:02:25.480> quite

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070

right there you get an idea of the
length<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.410> these<00:02:29.560> rows<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:30.160> run<00:02:30.340> both

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
length of these rows they run both

Fortson and there was a Massey Ferguson
and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
and

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.460 
and
and<00:03:51.420> then<00:03:51.569> mass<00:03:51.780> he<00:03:51.930> got<00:03:52.110> together<00:03:52.260> with

and then mass he got together with

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.290 
and then mass he got together with
Harris<00:03:52.920> we<00:03:53.100> had<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.310> massive<00:03:53.550> Harris<00:03:54.000> at<00:03:54.180> one

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
Harris we had a massive Harris at one

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.030 
Harris we had a massive Harris at one
time<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:55.350> would<00:03:55.440> have<00:03:55.530> been<00:03:55.590> headlights

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
time and it would have been headlights

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.320 
time and it would have been headlights
up<00:03:56.220> here<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.550> I<00:03:56.580> thought<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.880> was<00:03:57.060> kind<00:03:57.090> of

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
up here and I thought this was kind of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.720 
up here and I thought this was kind of
neat<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.600> little<00:03:57.870> Art<00:03:58.050> Deco<00:03:58.310> mouth<00:03:59.310> for<00:03:59.670> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
neat this little Art Deco mouth for the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.160 
neat this little Art Deco mouth for the
headlights<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.360> looks<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:00.720> little<00:04:00.990> wing

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
headlights here looks like a little wing

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.650 
headlights here looks like a little wing
there's<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.190> little<00:04:02.400> extra<00:04:02.550> touch<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.240> you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
there's a little extra touch that you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.580 
there's a little extra touch that you
wouldn't<00:04:04.130> he<00:04:05.130> wouldn't<00:04:05.280> see<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.819> tractor

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
wouldn't he wouldn't see on a tractor

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.440 
wouldn't he wouldn't see on a tractor
today<00:04:07.590> probably<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.430> little<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.030> design

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
today probably a little bit of design

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.230 
today probably a little bit of design
there<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.050> think<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.640> Ford<00:04:11.640> grille<00:04:11.940> might<00:04:12.150> have

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
there I think the Ford grille might have

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.730 
there I think the Ford grille might have
been<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> little<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.720> different<00:04:13.080> but<00:04:13.200> it's<00:04:13.650> a

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
been a little bit different but it's a

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.110 
been a little bit different but it's a
pretty<00:04:13.980> neat<00:04:14.130> old<00:04:14.280> Ferguson<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:14.940> there's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
pretty neat old Ferguson and there's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.080 
pretty neat old Ferguson and there's

so<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.700> was<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.000> pretty<00:04:42.210> pretty<00:04:43.169> good<00:04:44.150> tractor

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
so this was a pretty pretty good tractor

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.060 
so this was a pretty pretty good tractor
in<00:04:45.570> its<00:04:45.750> day<00:04:46.050> had<00:04:46.470> had<00:04:47.160> a<00:04:47.190> few<00:04:47.400> extras<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:49.070> like

25th 41 up to February 15 1955 we've got
us<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.360> Stuart<00:05:06.630> Warner<00:05:06.990> amperage<00:05:07.830> gauge<00:05:08.130> on

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
us a Stuart Warner amperage gauge on

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.469 
us a Stuart Warner amperage gauge on
there<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:10.070> tractor<00:05:11.070> meter<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:12.000> Ferguson

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
there and a tractor meter a Ferguson

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.409 
there and a tractor meter a Ferguson
tractor<00:05:13.050> meter<00:05:13.260> gives<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:13.950> your<00:05:14.280> miles<00:05:15.150> per

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
tractor meter gives you your miles per

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:24.080 
tractor meter gives you your miles per
hour<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:18.650> your<00:05:19.729> rpms<00:05:21.650> all<00:05:22.650> pressure<00:05:23.090> fuel

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
hour and your rpms all pressure fuel

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.370 
hour and your rpms all pressure fuel
gauge<00:05:24.450> looks<00:05:24.810> like<00:05:25.020> it's<00:05:25.760> probably<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:27.840> fuel

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
gauge looks like it's probably that fuel

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.880 
gauge looks like it's probably that fuel
no<00:05:29.160> that's<00:05:29.780> temperature<00:05:30.780> temperature<00:05:31.560> gauge

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
no that's temperature temperature gauge

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.090 
no that's temperature temperature gauge
and<00:05:32.190> there's<00:05:32.340> all<00:05:32.550> pressure<00:05:33.410> no<00:05:34.410> fuel<00:05:34.710> gauge<00:05:34.890> I

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
and there's all pressure no fuel gauge I

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.409 
and there's all pressure no fuel gauge I
guess<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:35.910> anyway

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
guess but anyway

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.370 
guess but anyway
Tim<00:05:37.289> gauges<00:05:37.740> seen<00:05:37.950> its<00:05:38.130> better<00:05:38.370> days<00:05:39.380> anyway

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
Tim gauges seen its better days anyway

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.500 
Tim gauges seen its better days anyway
just<00:05:40.740> thought<00:05:40.979> I'd<00:05:41.130> take<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.940> minute<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.330> show

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
just thought I'd take a minute and show

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.940 
just thought I'd take a minute and show
you<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.780> old<00:05:43.700> Ferguson<00:05:44.700> tractor

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
you the old Ferguson tractor

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.860 
you the old Ferguson tractor
yeah<00:05:46.950> we<00:05:47.130> need<00:05:47.280> o-ring<00:05:48.560> see<00:05:49.560> you<00:05:49.620> soon
