then<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:16.259> ahead<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.500> run<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:17.640> its

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
then go ahead and run it through its

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.120 
then go ahead and run it through its
motion<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.229> an<00:01:19.350> idea<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:19.860> it

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
this machine or 5,000 335 I think it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:47.369 
this machine or 5,000 335 I think it
just<00:03:38.900> about<00:03:39.079> broken<00:03:39.409> in<00:03:39.620> itself<00:03:41.019> maybe

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.059 

the<00:03:47.890> cooling<00:03:48.549> trays<00:03:48.849> are<00:03:49.659> not<00:03:49.930> set<00:03:50.709> up<00:03:50.739> under

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
the cooling trays are not set up under

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.550 
the cooling trays are not set up under
the<00:03:51.159> machine<00:03:51.459> at<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.670> moment<00:03:51.999> but<00:03:52.719> we<00:03:53.230> do<00:03:53.379> have

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
the machine at the moment but we do have

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:19.640 
the machine at the moment but we do have
them

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.920 

the<00:04:19.919> box<00:04:20.129> waves<00:04:20.430> appear<00:04:20.879> to<00:04:20.999> be<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.269> excellent

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the box waves appear to be in excellent

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:31.689 
the box waves appear to be in excellent
condition

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.399 

we<00:04:32.300> got<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.509> run<00:04:32.659> through<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.960> whole<00:04:33.080> program

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
we got to run through the whole program

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.159 
we got to run through the whole program
right<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.159> whole<00:04:34.310> cycle<00:04:35.530> yeah

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
right the whole cycle yeah

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.100 
right the whole cycle yeah
and<00:04:37.710> it's<00:04:37.889> been<00:04:38.069> a<00:04:38.099> little<00:04:38.280> will<00:04:38.430> speed<00:04:38.759> up

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
and it's been a little will speed up

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.510 
and it's been a little will speed up
yeah<00:04:40.110> well<00:04:40.680> we'll<00:04:40.860> try<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.099> wait<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.310> few

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
yeah well we'll try to wait a few

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.770 
yeah well we'll try to wait a few
minutes<00:04:41.789> here<00:04:41.909> without<00:04:42.090> boring<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.629> to<00:04:42.689> death

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
minutes here without boring you to death

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.040 
minutes here without boring you to death
but<00:04:43.199> that<00:04:43.680> spindle<00:04:44.580> will<00:04:44.759> speed<00:04:45.090> up<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.419> take

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
but that spindle will speed up and take

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.800 
but that spindle will speed up and take
off<00:04:46.259> maybe<00:04:46.529> we<00:04:46.800> could<00:04:47.069> zoom<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.479> little<00:04:48.599> bit

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
off maybe we could zoom in a little bit

00:04:48.810 --> 00:05:56.490 
off maybe we could zoom in a little bit
more<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.199> some<00:04:49.469> of<00:04:49.499> the<00:04:49.620> ways

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.350 

looks<00:05:57.100> like<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.460> spindle<00:05:57.820> slowing<00:05:58.180> down<00:05:58.300> a

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
looks like the spindle slowing down a

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.780 
looks like the spindle slowing down a
little<00:05:58.570> bit<00:05:59.310> hopefully<00:06:00.310> it'll<00:06:00.460> speed<00:06:00.760> up

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
little bit hopefully it'll speed up

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:14.720 
little bit hopefully it'll speed up
right<00:06:01.780> after<00:06:02.050> this

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.450 

well<00:06:15.300> I<00:06:15.360> think<00:06:15.600> that<00:06:15.780> gives<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.170> a<00:06:16.230> good<00:06:16.470> good

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
well I think that gives you a good good

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.990 
well I think that gives you a good good
idea<00:06:17.790> what<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.030> machine<00:06:18.330> is<00:06:18.360> and<00:06:19.820> we're<00:06:20.820> gonna

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
idea what the machine is and we're gonna

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.920 
idea what the machine is and we're gonna
let<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.870> cycle<00:06:22.260> finish<00:06:22.950> off<00:06:23.160> and<00:06:23.480> that<00:06:24.480> should

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
let the cycle finish off and that should

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.530 
let the cycle finish off and that should
do<00:06:25.170> it<00:06:25.200> if<00:06:25.380> you<00:06:25.470> have<00:06:25.590> any<00:06:25.770> questions<00:06:26.540> please
