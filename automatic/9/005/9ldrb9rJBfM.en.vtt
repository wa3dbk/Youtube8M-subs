you<00:00:23.550> may<00:00:24.150> know<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.449> material<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.900> chicken

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
you may know this material is chicken

you may know this material is chicken
wire<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.710> poultry<00:00:26.099> netting<00:00:28.730> wrap<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> piece

wire or poultry netting wrap the piece

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
wire or poultry netting wrap the piece
into<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.390> cylinder<00:00:30.750> holding<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> overlapping

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
into a cylinder holding the overlapping

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740 
into a cylinder holding the overlapping
ends<00:00:32.250> together<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:33.000> count<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> number<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
ends together then count the number of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.930 
ends together then count the number of
grids<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.350> squares<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.190> including<00:00:35.850> the

grids or squares there are including the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
grids or squares there are including the
overlapping<00:00:36.360> ends<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> final<00:00:38.129> number

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
overlapping ends you need a final number

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.490 
overlapping ends you need a final number
that's<00:00:38.730> divisible<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:39.180> three<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.290> any

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that's divisible by three so make any

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.650 
that's divisible by three so make any
adjustments<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.850> ahead<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> wire<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
adjustments then go ahead and wire the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.729 
adjustments then go ahead and wire the
ends<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.960> place<00:00:45.079> now<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.350> divide<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
ends in place now you can divide the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
ends in place now you can divide the
number<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> grids<00:00:47.340> by<00:00:47.550> three<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
number of grids by three and that's the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.270 
number of grids by three and that's the
number<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> vertical<00:00:49.350> strips<00:00:49.710> you'll<00:00:49.890> cut<00:00:50.070> for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
number of vertical strips you'll cut for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
number of vertical strips you'll cut for
weaving<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.210> vertical<00:00:51.629> strips<00:00:51.899> should<00:00:52.050> be

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
weaving the vertical strips should be

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.229 
weaving the vertical strips should be
about<00:00:52.320> 18<00:00:52.710> inches<00:00:52.860> long<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
about 18 inches long if you want that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.910 
about 18 inches long if you want that
extra<00:00:54.270> length<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.199> some<00:00:55.379> give<00:00:55.649> while

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
extra length so you have some give while

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.170 
extra length so you have some give while
you're<00:00:56.070> weaving<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> mesh

don't try to work too quickly and be

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.130 
don't try to work too quickly and be
gentle<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> veneer<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> can

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
gentle with the veneer because it can

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.340 
gentle with the veneer because it can
snap<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.800> tug<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.280> Bend<00:01:02.489> too<00:01:02.640> hard<00:01:03.350> weave
