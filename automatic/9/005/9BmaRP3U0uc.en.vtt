 Why did you get your hair done again? 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.230
 Straight to straighten 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.230
 You cut it off and give it to you . 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:58.450
 Oh, well, third place is resignation, the first home run

 But the severity is of course not red. 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:28.970
 In the past three years, 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.970
 It's time to take up Yvonne e, who presented a victory for his family 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:41.830
 Since the 4th Taiwan, 9 rice cakes have been clogged with elemental gum . 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.090
 In our country before this word it entered now by a 9 m consecutive home runs

 When geuraeteul a color to wear now I write to him, the last three of nine individuals 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.600
 At the moment of the home run , Lee was the manager of the steel mill. 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.600
 This 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.940
 I think that it will not break even after 100 years of soil science. 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:05.330
 I am a player in the same field. 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.830

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.710
 9 when seven consecutive homers As you might feel that the answer is really too much 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.540
 How was it 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.250
 Yes 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 Six are too much from the difficulty, from the facial expression to what I think 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.450
 You did not let me focus on you. 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.049
 4 It became the index. I wanted to do it though, and I was greedy . 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:43.230
 I 'm just wondering how people responded that they watched from the side. 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:46.829
 When I eat 9 games , I have a chance to be more serious than myself . 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.209

 Eoyeo lung players Anhui step that is what I had hands, or believe that ah 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.900
 In fact, I do not want to get into the story . 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.760
 I did it a lot, and I did not even say it because now 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.049
 About to stand up, but we do not speak off-highway is already doing gukron 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.409
 For such a new world 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.489
 So concentration is the only way to wow you . 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:29.669
 Well, let's not put a strain on the conversation . 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.180
 Well, I just set a record . 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:37.739
 Records from're many have been broken then another without checking Example 1 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.510
 10 wins Yes Yes I have a great record of it I think you made it Your appearance 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.269
 The people around him did not burden you feel that the media preference or mood 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.900
 But I have to come. You 're acting this way. 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:56.489
 For handmade coach being directed to me was very real indeed real increase in Busan 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.310
 I do not know what the media is doing before the real fight, 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.599
 It's a toothbrush . I gave it to jt . Front pig.

 I lost it, but I do not have a reason pointer . 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:14.010
 It is not the situation that Sunyoung is doing. 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.940
 I was right when I was right , but at the time I was honestly nervous 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.109
 I did not write it because I could hit a home run 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:27.060
 So I was not thinking about the game and let's get that psychological pressure 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:31.680
 When the consecutive point hits are increased one by one, 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:36.389
 The median will be beyond your imagination . 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.919
 I saw. In the tenth game, Daisy Vero, who played a home run , ran. 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.880
 Why is it so trivial? How long have you been receiving that spotlight and recording 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.599
 With 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.950
 I realized how deep and deep I was in those days. 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:52.840
 4 But I actually did not have nine, the most memorable I personally 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.590
 Someday something. 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.550
 Other games I honestly remember a lot , 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.120
 In other words 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:08.309
