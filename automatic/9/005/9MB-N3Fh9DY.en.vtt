00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.210
 people these chairs chrome 11 am 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 I hope you are doing something else 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 you need an analysis on the string one 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.450
 new very big review after louis 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 evening stoxx yesterday if you have not seen va 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.779
 have reviewed the midfield 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
 Colombian Real Madrid 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.350
 ramesh rodrigues version team of the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.460
 season you have his stats signed small 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.079
 childhood of your sons and I invite you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 so to put on break or subway in 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.820
 back frenzy observed at the level of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 the team in which I calais them 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 do not hesitate to do it 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 if you have the credits because this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.410
 team is just ultra 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.850
 competitive I still have not lost a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 only match with this team 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.660
 it's really a treat to play with 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.640
 this team 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.560
 the pick up rodriguez his fork of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 prices vary between the two consoles 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.989
 between 500 million and 850 thousand credits 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.970
 on xbox 800000 1200000 credit on 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 playstation but given the quality of the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.439
 player I find it's cheap paid 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 when you compare some of the prigent 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.009
 neymar the ronaldo the messi and his 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.049
 terraces is really very very high 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.310
 even suarez 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.920
 the ram is rodriguez he makes a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.299
 difference of patients on the ground of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.619
 blow if you have the credits do not hesitate 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.119
 really not to take it to you because 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.039
 it is the very very big blow of heart 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 for the moment already last year 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.509
 I liked his version thou 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.929
 seras metz rodriguez but here I find 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.340
 that it's even more of the madness 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.689
 so much it makes the difference at 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.759
 pass quality level the keystroke 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.079
 but that I'll tell you about it soon 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.490
 now with the positives and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.499
 the negative points he still has two 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.569
 negatives will be metz rodriguez there 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.189
 is not perfect and despite these points 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.090
 negative they still happen to be 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.340
 monstrous so the stat in relaxation 61 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.600
 years to the closed islands of 80 so that's him 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.409
 still allows to take balloons 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.060
 of the head etc 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.599
 it has in addition a good precision in the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.789
 aerial domain but that's enough 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.409
 pity because there are moments 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.329
 some situations where will help in 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.640
 lax finally he brought into the surface of 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.770
 repair and tuchan very low they are 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 so finally at the level of relaxation 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.709
 6th so not the fact that they will 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.840
 not the balloons of the head and that's 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.730
 still somewhat problematic is 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.040
 the other negative is the 3 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 star bad foot these three stars 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.769
 bad foot he has a right foot really 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.599
 random moments where the right foot 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.709
 and hurry up and forgive the coup 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.450
 I decided to put it in the points 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.400
 negatives because it's true that there are 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.860
 some times when his right foot took me 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.940
 posed problems to its limits ya not 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.590
 of guardian he knocks next 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.830
 what is it to tell you what 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 point the right foot maybe maybe 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.400
 weird in the rat metz rodriguez after 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.870
 he compensates because he has a left foot 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 simply monstrous and that we go 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.959
 talk about it now with the points 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.430
 positive so at the points level 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.069
 positive set pieces 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.530
 free kicks penalties 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.090
 corner you can shot the three balls and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.099
 three sets of kicks dispute 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.629
 with him he will really have no problem 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.549
 angles and really holds them very 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.260
 very well free kicks 90 without 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.620
 accuracy of free kicks with 1.93 in 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.090
 effect and 1.88 in hitting power 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.829
 it's just perfect there are two hits 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.060
 francs in this review the two I the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.859
 loved at the bottom so certainly I have one 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.769
 little bit with success because 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.840
 ramos the dvi but the free kick that is 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.700
 now you will see that it is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.140
 really that's what is great from 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.849
 which he really holds very well and 1 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.049
 91-year-old penalty I had two three 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.019
 penaltouches during this review 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.319
 I put them all at the bottom after 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.750
 physical 81 in strength 79 in balance 89 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.040
 in agility at the physical level which 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.599
 really pulls very very well 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.220
 politicians very well on his legs 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.829
 also he gets moved very very 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.419
 hardly by the defenders and that 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.430
 it really is a very big strength you 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.139
 pick up rodriguez it is very complicated 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.030
 to move it's really hard to 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.419
 defend on him after at the level of the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.250
 hit 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.980
 I have it all because the typing 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.980
 it's madness 91 soaring 92 in shot 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.700
 88 in striking power 90 in finish 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.079
 93 indeed are 90 in finish for a 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.370
 offensive midfielder it's madness in front of 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.780
 the cages he's really very very good 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.799
 it's like having a scorer there 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.090
 it's as if you had a scorer at 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.919
 whenever in front of the cages with 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.609
 their wives reunite it can do 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.310
 goal 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.230
 even on far-off strikes 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.060
 you do not have no questions 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.190
 to land the two months you can hit 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.780
 in any position with him 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.910
 that and I did not score big fat long 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.410
 shot but follows all the strikes 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.940
 distant from the rat left very Metz 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.290
 although it is already the last it takes 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.110
 that I'm accelerating at the level of quality 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.880
 95 years vision 92 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.070
 we pass on the map whether it's the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.470
 lobed passes the short passes the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.060
 deep passes to the ground 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.669
 you can make assists 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.930
 madness with rower rodriguez is low 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.000
 and that's a bit of a goal too when 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.040
 you have an offensive midfielder with such 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.410
 quality and suddenly that's what makes it 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.180
 as monstrous so there you have the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.800
 balance of pickup rodriguez stocks what 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.690
 appears before your eyes so at the level 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.190
 positive points kicks 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.720
 stopped you can shoot corners and 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.800
 free kicks the penaltys with him without 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.750
 no problem 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.190
 his game vision 95th rank just vision 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.840
 perfect for an attacking midfielder then 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.310
 they love these two bases but hey you 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.020
 put a ram is subject the ground 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.280
 it's not necessarily about me it's not 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.690
 too much my kiff of the shot I prefer 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.360
 really put it in front so as 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.290
 that offensive midfielder torch see md 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.900
 it's because there are even people who 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.300
 play it mdc I think it's 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.840
 mess of putting it to this post there his 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.130
 so hits finish longhot the 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.470
 flip- flops we could see the little 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.050
 flip-flop on the end it's just 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.640
 perfect at the level of ramed rodriguez the 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.289
 speed I did not speak but the colme 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.970
 1.86 speed on the map 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.229
 he's really fast here he is 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.810
 very fast when it is launched it is 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.039
 very very complicated to stop 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.260
 technically really very 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.870
 impressive drif so they are 1.99 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.729
 andré bean games in 92 united and who 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.889
 will be happy 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.169
 I confuse with with another player 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.729
 but 92 in dribbling game at 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.389
 the execution of these are when happens 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.469
 such a level 92-93 20099 this is 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.639
 almost the same in the end in 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.860
 running the dribbling zips out 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.990
 so quickly that it's physical 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.639
 balance strength they are really very 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.150
 very good on his legs very hard 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.099
 to move 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.689
 that's what they also have good 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.949
 his head game before the show it's 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.830
 jamie in the proposals because 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.849
 here is a good stat in mind on 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.080
 a few balloons that I took from the 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.059
 head with him it's true that it was going 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.409
 well I have not scored but it's mostly 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.909
 on the phases are on the balloons 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.139
 in quotation marks what I call 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.509
 defensive balloons on the raises of the 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.279
 guards fact they still believe 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.509
 a lot of balloons since he is often 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.099
 well placed in fact he does not need to 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.770
 jump so he takes the balloons well and 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.029
 bailly finally with his precision that him 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.499
 allows to orient them really very 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.460
 very well 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:26.479
 positioning always well placed very 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.770
 easy to find 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.180
 what I liked what is 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.069
 really ahead of your time good in 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.149
 time he will go down to defend but 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.319
 it's true that overall it's 

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:34.610
 almost all the time before and that 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.080
 it's still a big plus 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.520
 its pass quality which is just 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.930
 outstanding four-star gesture 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.879
 obviously guardian technique that he is 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.229
 with their weapons and rodriguez so it's 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.830
 always kiffant is therefore in the 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.379
 negative points 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.120
 sow and the three bad foot stars 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.039
 are going to settle down here it's mostly 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.020
 when you are going to center in the surface and 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.339
 that he is there and that madfrog who jumps to 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.779
 pain and he can not seem to take the 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.060
 ball of the head it is clear that it is 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.020
 quite disturbing and the three states the 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.520
 bad losing his left foot is 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.899
 so powerful that limits you 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.159
 records of his right foot but in 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.719
 some situations it still poses 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:05.300
 problem and so you see stats 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:07.009
 with monstrous stats seven matches 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.589
 11 goals and 8 assists 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.580
 ultra complete stats for a medium 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:12.289
 offensive so that's all for 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.159
