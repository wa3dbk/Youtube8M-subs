what to do with anything and I have
serrata<00:04:14.190> show<00:04:14.459> him<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:15.410> when<00:04:16.410> they

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
serrata show him like when they

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.710 
serrata show him like when they
eventually<00:04:16.799> do<00:04:17.190> makeup<00:04:17.389> how<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.419> do

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
eventually do makeup how to do

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.300 
eventually do makeup how to do
everything<00:04:19.200> on<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> computer<00:04:19.919> because<00:04:20.100> he

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
everything on the computer because he

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.750 
everything on the computer because he
just<00:04:20.489> doesn't<00:04:20.880> know<00:04:20.910> um<00:04:21.329> that'd<00:04:22.320> be<00:04:22.470> funny<00:04:22.760> but

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
just doesn't know um that'd be funny but

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.149 
just doesn't know um that'd be funny but
either<00:04:23.909> way<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.630> do<00:04:25.229> believe<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:25.740> sir<00:04:25.919> ana's

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
either way I do believe that sir ana's

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.620 
either way I do believe that sir ana's
birth<00:04:26.190> records<00:04:26.760> were<00:04:26.909> definitely<00:04:27.270> hit

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
birth records were definitely hit

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.560 
birth records were definitely hit
purpose<00:04:28.140> um<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.950> starting<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.970> look<00:04:30.000> more

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
purpose um it's starting to look more

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.830 
purpose um it's starting to look more
like<00:04:31.220> sasuke<00:04:32.220> has<00:04:32.430> reason<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.030> actually<00:04:33.420> do

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
like sasuke has reason to actually do

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.370 
like sasuke has reason to actually do
this<00:04:34.400> not<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.730> was<00:04:35.910> good<00:04:36.750> still<00:04:37.110> I'm

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
this not that it was good still I'm

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.770 
this not that it was good still I'm
still<00:04:37.650> very<00:04:37.890> angry<00:04:38.130> at<00:04:38.400> him<00:04:38.550> but<00:04:38.910> um<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.540> could

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
still very angry at him but um it could

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.450 
still very angry at him but um it could
have<00:04:39.900> possibly<00:04:40.080> done<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> hide<00:04:40.950> records

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
have possibly done it to hide records

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.000 
have possibly done it to hide records
that<00:04:41.700> saw<00:04:42.090> Saradha<00:04:42.630> was<00:04:42.780> born<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.320> don't<00:04:43.890> know

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
that saw Saradha was born I don't know

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.800 
that saw Saradha was born I don't know
how<00:04:44.190> big<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.460> secret<00:04:44.880> she<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.180> since<00:04:45.450> she<00:04:45.630> wears

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
how big a secret she is since she wears

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.930 
how big a secret she is since she wears
the<00:04:46.080> chia<00:04:46.500> symbol<00:04:46.920> just<00:04:47.280> around<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.640> village

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the chia symbol just around the village

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.630 
the chia symbol just around the village
but<00:04:48.770> maybe<00:04:49.770> they<00:04:49.950> just<00:04:49.980> didn't<00:04:50.310> want<00:04:50.490> word

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
but maybe they just didn't want word

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.550 
but maybe they just didn't want word
spreading<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.510> strata<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:52.050> other<00:04:52.320> villages

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
spreading of strata to other villages

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.910 
spreading of strata to other villages
I'm<00:04:53.400> not<00:04:54.150> entirely<00:04:54.480> sure<00:04:54.660> how<00:04:55.050> he<00:04:55.110> was<00:04:55.530> going

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
I'm not entirely sure how he was going

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.490 
I'm not entirely sure how he was going
to<00:04:56.010> go<00:04:56.130> about<00:04:56.250> handling<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.880> so<00:04:57.180> maybe

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
to go about handling that so maybe

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.870 
to go about handling that so maybe
because<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.620> would<00:04:58.770> obviously<00:04:58.890> spread<00:04:59.640> when

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
because that would obviously spread when

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.450 
because that would obviously spread when
things<00:05:00.150> um<00:05:00.890> like<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:03.560> June<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.100> Chunin

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
things um like the June like the Chunin

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.550 
things um like the June like the Chunin
exams<00:05:05.790> happened<00:05:06.750> when<00:05:06.930> like<00:05:07.110> all<00:05:07.320> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
exams happened when like all the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.410 
exams happened when like all the
villages<00:05:07.890> get<00:05:08.100> together<00:05:08.250> because<00:05:09.210> right<00:05:09.390> now

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
villages get together because right now

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.090 
villages get together because right now
this<00:05:09.840> is<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.020> graduation<00:05:10.590> this<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:10.920> still

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
this is just graduation this is still

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.550 
this is just graduation this is still
just<00:05:11.250> leaf<00:05:11.490> village<00:05:11.790> but<00:05:12.540> maybe<00:05:12.750> he<00:05:12.930> had<00:05:13.290> like

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
just leaf village but maybe he had like

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.290 
just leaf village but maybe he had like
a<00:05:13.590> set<00:05:13.860> period<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.220> time<00:05:14.280> maybe<00:05:14.610> he<00:05:14.880> had<00:05:15.060> all

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
a set period of time maybe he had all

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.050 
a set period of time maybe he had all
these<00:05:15.600> 12<00:05:15.930> years<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:17.190> get<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:17.520> done<00:05:17.820> before

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
these 12 years to get this done before

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.910 
these 12 years to get this done before
that<00:05:18.360> happened<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.050> his<00:05:19.200> daughter<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.620> before

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
that happened to his daughter and before

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.120 
that happened to his daughter and before
she<00:05:20.130> became<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:21.110> news<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.260> everyone<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:22.860> that's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
she became a news to everyone so that's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.800 
she became a news to everyone so that's
my<00:05:23.310> theory<00:05:23.580> at<00:05:23.730> this<00:05:23.850> point<00:05:24.090> is<00:05:24.180> he's<00:05:24.480> probably

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
my theory at this point is he's probably

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.660 
my theory at this point is he's probably
doing<00:05:25.020> this<00:05:25.260> all<00:05:25.470> for<00:05:25.860> Surata<00:05:26.280> that's

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
doing this all for Surata that's

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.220 
doing this all for Surata that's
probably<00:05:27.030> when<00:05:27.210> he<00:05:27.360> left<00:05:27.570> because<00:05:27.720> he's<00:05:28.050> like

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
probably when he left because he's like

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.860 
probably when he left because he's like
I<00:05:28.410> gotta<00:05:28.590> take<00:05:28.890> care<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.130> this<00:05:29.720> whatever<00:05:30.720> the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
I gotta take care of this whatever the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.470 
I gotta take care of this whatever the
heck<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:31.760> maybe<00:05:32.760> he<00:05:32.910> just<00:05:32.940> doesn't<00:05:33.150> wanna

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
heck this is maybe he just doesn't wanna
