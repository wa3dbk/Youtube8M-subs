00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.169
 we take up this series episode number 3 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.420
 already bump with the rush this time with the 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.430
 vector a weapon that I do not usually bring much 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.260
 to the channel and in other channels I think 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.700
 it does not appear much either because it is a weapon 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.140
 a little weak 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.329
 sometimes works well other times 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.609
 it works bad but he was good when 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.829
 only though when you are watching from 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.929
 evolution of double points 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.079
 quite some time ago because this game 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.279
 the line keeps for months I 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.279
 I already have a void that is worth 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.440
 prestige in number 3 was trying 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.420
 draw mind and tacs of barbarians if I do not 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.330
 I'm wrong because you're going to see this game 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.980
 more than 100 casualties using gusts of 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.440
 helps pre-jobs without streaks but 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.990
 good killing only with the weapon with 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.850
 the c4 being completely alone for 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.730
 take out my clips so I did not care 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.170
 nothing when he killed when he died that was 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.180
 what happened the game always and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.620
 when you take out a clip what was it 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.080
 what happened because I got a letter from 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.940
 A pretty pretty pretty pest 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.340
 you will see it later in the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.590
 gameplay the first round 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.440
 only 20 casualties because I just in 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.220
 followed none of the opposing team 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.430
 by the tail 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.370
 so the round ended super fast the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.040
 second round I get about 70 and peak of 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.320
 low and in the last round magician about 15 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.720
 16 or there goes so one more than 100 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.900
 casualties and a demolition game in 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.730
 loop down does not matter or anything but I 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 I think quite a lot of retreat to see or to 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.740
 less is what I expect because if not that 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.630
 this series would not make any sense and 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.750
 as there are not many new people in the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.920
 channel since the last time last two 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.020
 seasons the one that I liked the most 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.540
 it was the first one who uploaded the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.119
 absorption and not completely the sack in 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.010
 raid that there are not as many casualties as in 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.690
 this episode but at least for me it's 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.850
 the one that I liked most to date 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.250
 that's why I'm going to leave the link in 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.170
 the description and this series consists 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.450
 enough that you have lived with light weight 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.670
 and with extreme conditioning and without 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.360
 silencer and without ghost directly 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.890
 to sack killing with the weapon or with good 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.320
 and with the weapon with the primary or the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.440
 secondary or with lethal grenades or 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.510
 secondary grenades so more 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.700
 entertaining can not be no casualties 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.150
 with dog there are no casualties with swarms 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.110
 a helicopter is the whole weapon with a weapon 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.110
 no man 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.879
 you can say but good in this 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.129
 game was playing against a group 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.110
 of Spaniards I do not know if they were subscribers 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:34.430
 or not because at that time 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.200
 we were half about 510,000 maybe like that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.510
 I do not know if they were subscribers or not or if 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.319
 you are not then to identify the section of 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.580
 comments 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.750
 so well let's talk today about 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.489
 good to see this series consists of 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 explain the tips on how to 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.360
 russia better for those who do not know it because 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.069
 like I have not climbed for so long 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.959
 No episode of this series, there will be 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.360
 that explain it again so good 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.489
 today the advice that I am going to give you more than 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.980
 nothing because you ask me a lot of you 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.049
 you tell me frames because you go here 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.480
 because you throw over there because you move 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.150
 so they will be exhibited 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.239
 explain a little bit of all that I tell you 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.250
 first before anything above all before 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.440
 it was his head I always and two hundred 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.090
 sometimes directly ran palante 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.510
 the pulsar game started 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.459
 left and did not let go was all the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.220
 while running all the time movement 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.290
 He has no head from where he thought he thought 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.750
 that was on the enemies but it's 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.550
 true to paraphrase asking for 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.440
 announce a little bit also with head 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.870
 we need that network where the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.209
 enemies where are the enemies and the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.060
 easiest way to find out the way more 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.280
 easy to improve your fire shape 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.430
 is how to operate as then it is always 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.530
 play once again and always be 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.959
 pending of the williams that is like 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.180
 I learned the contrary, sorry for silver 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.459
 forgiveness of enemies are usually placed 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.930
 normally park the maps in 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.630
 all the games there are always 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.459
 hot spots not as it says too 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.829
 that way like in all the hot ones 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.730
 because they are points where people always 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.920
 is usually in the games there are many 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.019
 camperos recent people who always 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.540
 position all maps in the same 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.430
 place in this case look town is a bad 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.919
 example to tell you about this with 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.139
 simple because the answers are very clear 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.880
 especially in demolition but you have to 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.280
 take into account kids 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.290
 in the same places imagine that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.990
 we are in a raid the raid there is always 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.240
 people in sees in the two windows should by 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.190
 example in the kitchen area in the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.530
 Money area in the pool area 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:42.110
 they are people in each zone 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.220
 and completely remediable and if you want 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.290
 learn the remains on youtube but I 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.440
 I would say my advice here would be that 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.840
 look minimal to see where 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.030
 if your colleagues are born in a place 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.100
 has you follow it to the other side of the 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.400
 map because that's where your children are born 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.400
 companions 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.910
 they usually go crazy, that's a way 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.890
 like a little bit different but that story 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.170
 domain for example if you play duel for 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.360
 paid equipment confirmed always look 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.100
 to look where our 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.680
 comrades are all doing your 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.940
 comrades because the enemies 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.740
 normally if they are not changing the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.740
 points we can talk about the points 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.300
 hot we have the ones that way they're going to 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.450
 be doing the other rope on the map 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.700
 so I would say to explain when 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.370
 I have to practice is that you play and 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.020
 when you play fixes directly 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.870
 and it also helps a lot 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.240
 thought about this case because that's how you can 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.610
 see you can see where they usually do 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.640
 enemies and so learn you a little bit 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.770
 plus the respawn points of each map 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.350
 of each game where you try and you 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.060
 I advise that if you like he pointed out palencia 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.440
 for example that you play a lot of point 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.360
 brave to sell in those responsible 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.370
 if you like domain play 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.310
 many times to mastery to learn the 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.439
 response because it's the best and sometimes that 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.039
 I do not say it but the gameplays you see that 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:09.289
 I thank 4 without spy planes without 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.550
 know if there are people or there are no more people 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.580
 that nothing because he overtook me 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.740
 movements and that's something that then 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.960
 forgot to achieve then with practice like this 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.000
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.000
 a greeting see you later and see you
