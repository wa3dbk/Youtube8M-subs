roughed up to line the 2x4 with anza
each<00:01:15.060> piece<00:01:15.390> goes<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> jointer<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
each piece goes through the jointer to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.249 
each piece goes through the jointer to
get<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.250> face<00:01:17.460> tray<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:17.939> 90<00:01:18.509> degrees<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.110> of

triangle on each mortise when all the
triangles<00:02:40.569> are<00:02:41.049> done<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.470> drove<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> pieces<00:02:42.400> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
triangles are done I drove the pieces I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.780 
triangles are done I drove the pieces I
drill<00:02:44.080> all<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.560> mortise<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.159> the<00:02:45.430> drill<00:02:45.640> press

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
drill all the mortise on the drill press

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.479 
drill all the mortise on the drill press
