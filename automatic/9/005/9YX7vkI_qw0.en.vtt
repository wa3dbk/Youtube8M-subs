 the only thing we did at gamescom 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.150
 autographs are actually made 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.440
 written photos and that was done 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.420

 thought really cool game and some 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.480

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.940
 channel has somehow nothing to do 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.730
 be negative and as long as that is so 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.440
 disengaged honor is the name of the team 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.890
 already said he is quiet here and now 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.980

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.959
 I can take you no controller 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.940
 I know but I know so in itself 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.620
 if it works well then do it right 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.570
 so no idea so I found that 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.769
 play in any case so very cool what he 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.209
 thinks it would be better than looking at 2 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.370
 so I can not do that right now 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.560

 So I have my pizza only half 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.360
 managed because you are almost always 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.319
 after a few more colleagues come 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.239

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.760

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.780

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.419

 So you should get out if you're upset 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.650
 In any case, here in the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.510

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.750
 Do not make something blatant again 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.070

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.240

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.979
