i<00:02:35.110> started<00:02:35.710> with<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.100> watercolor<00:02:36.700> pencils

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.470 
i started with my watercolor pencils
just<00:02:37.570> made<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:38.770> nice<00:02:39.100> x<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:40.330> when<00:02:40.450> i

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
just made this nice x and then when i

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.140 
just made this nice x and then when i
got<00:02:40.720> ready<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.350> actually<00:02:41.590> design<00:02:42.130> my<00:02:42.400> page<00:02:42.700> i

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
got ready to actually design my page i

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.350 
got ready to actually design my page i
was<00:02:43.420> able<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.780> use<00:02:43.930> those<00:02:44.440> spaces<00:02:44.830> as

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
was able to use those spaces as

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.270 
was able to use those spaces as
inspiration<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:47.050> on<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.800> chose<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
inspiration so on this one I chose to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.949 
inspiration so on this one I chose to
put<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.550> words<00:02:48.760> at<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> bottom<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
put the words at the bottom and the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.340 
put the words at the bottom and the
illustration<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.830> top<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.720> another<00:02:53.050> one

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
illustration on the top it's another one

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.380 
illustration on the top it's another one
you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.830> see<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.070> started<00:02:54.550> with<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> big<00:02:55.060> loop

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
you can see I started with a big loop

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.260 
you can see I started with a big loop
and<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:57.280> sort<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.610> adds<00:02:57.790> to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
and it just it sort of adds to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.850

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
excitement and what I'm going to do with

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
one way I was experimenting with

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.880 
one way I was experimenting with
different<00:03:27.150> colors<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:29.650> later

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
actually came back and use these for

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.080 
actually came back and use these for
