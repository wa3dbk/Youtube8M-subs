 and we put to decompress this process is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 recommended 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.390
 let that quiet close all the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.380
 applications to all applications 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.380
 so it did not take so long 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.090
 when you finish decompressing there is no 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.710
 no mistake and tell me about crc anything 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 similar nor warning until 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.300
 unzip everything without errors we enter 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.330
 in the game folder and now we 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.170
 we found with the iso then to 23.6 gigas 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.300
 the voices in Spanish the first thing that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 we're going to do is set up the vision with the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.380
 Ultraism and we have it installed 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.450
 just right click mount your drive 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.090
 we finished the team and here we already found 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.610
 the image and is mounted 23 photos 6 gb 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.829
 10 in sections and we initiate the shakhtar 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.829
 [Music] 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.280
 or accept 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.840
 but we talk next post 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.580
 broken room months will be the grade to ground 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.040
 since we start installing we should have 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 patience is also recommended all 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.720
 the applications and leave the peseta 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.120
 let's use the encounter the image is 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.270
 that we already have mounted 3 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 we copy this 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.350
 we go to the folder we do not have it 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.350
 installed and we paste 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.410
 we review all the files 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.270
 and this applies also to the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.000
 translation 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.920
 the translation is where we decompress 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.319
 the game 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.599
 with this folder the bags the 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.880
 translation is in the Spanish position if 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.770
 they want to run the game with balls in 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.500
 English and Spanish texts can 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.000
 leave as they come here already for the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.760
 person who wants the Spanish accusation 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.010
 we copy this folder if we're going 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.440
 new to the installation folder and 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.380
 inside of it we pay that folder the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.040
 let's continue here add all the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.040
 voices in Spanish 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.890
 with more patience 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.340
 to about 600 thousand 700 megawatts the voices 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.909
 in Spanish ready the street to run 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.099
 the game we go to binaries and here 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.379
 we have if you have 32 bits input this 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.870
 folder if you have 64 bits you enter this 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.269
 folder my 64-bit operating system 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.819
 HuÃ¡ntar here here we modify the 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.549
 point here because it's set up in 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.409
 English can be seen here in gray is for 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.230
 modify it we do it with the pad of 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.629
 notes as I have a 28 I have to 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.939
 take a veil to the desk I cut it 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.939
 I'm going to the desk 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:24.440
 and style properties the attribute of 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.440
 read only applies it and modified it 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.100
 now I just cut it again and 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.100
 he left it in the folder of the serve 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.200
 spanish and executed this game as 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.200
 administrator and canyon 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.500
 call the roofs the way of the 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.129
 I just hope that thieves not who I 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.129
 I think it is 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.700
 ah 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.760
 and how he would not mind making more noise 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.840
 the next of that other mode and you're going to 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.840
 to know that it was me 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.300
