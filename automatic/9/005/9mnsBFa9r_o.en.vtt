 Hi everyone , all good, today's video is a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.189
 video that I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 was the shape of my room and the room of the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.309
 my sister she already explain 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.139

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.010
 our 47 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.330
 filmed a lot of things, yes, I 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 I filmed the process a little bit 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680
 of the process and then I decided to share 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 with you post this video on youtube 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.809
 for you to see some little things from 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 The way I think it's cool, you know. 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.500
 more or less as it was several 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 people had already asked about 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.059
 bedroom design and everything else 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 if you're new to my channel and have not yet 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.730
 saw everything through my room through the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.200
 my sister 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 the books will be here in the box 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.629
 information from the two videos for you to see 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.410
 how was the final result of the two 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.719
 bedrooms 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.360
 but the video of today you will see with the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.219
 sea ​​or 24 times so my room was 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 a toy room where the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.939
 our toys had a huge house 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.710
 here everything is normal like this and there you are 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.840
 will also see what the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.920
 my sister aunt who is the room where 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 slept 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.150
 So my mother and I slept in the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.659
 her room and I can say that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.159
 do you want to use my room then? 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.110
 talking about the kissing party for you not 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.549
 get confused by the filming because 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.340
 at the time I recorded this, I did not even know 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.880
 that was going to post on youtube is just like 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.549
 remembrance 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 but anyway it 's something else I wanted 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.390
 Warn you not to wonder that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.790
 practically all day the same work 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.430
 wearing a wig because at the time the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.439
 people had at the time of the relationship of picking up 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.710
 things in the room she calls turned that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.020
 We had to know carnival there and there 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.850
 she liked it only because the dog was 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 Just at home, do not leave home with that. 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 there is not but I wanted to tell anyone 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 Strange is commenting down here. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 What does the girl say to herself? 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.840
 silver wig do not forget that I 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.420
 I edited that video too when I 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.909
 was 9 or ten nine years I think 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.870
 so is there a caption that appear 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.290
 during the video 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.200
 I did when I was 9 years old so he 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.670
 isolated but thats it people it's just that 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680
 even though you were talking before you started 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.300
 video so if you want to know one 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 bit of how the reform of my 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.560
 room is just keep watching 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.579
 well then come on, I looked into my 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.170
 old photo albums and I found 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.569
 some little pictures that you can see 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.959
 more or less how were the rooms before 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.489
 of reform then this framework 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.049
 What are you seeing now is the bedroom? 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.760
 where the number but we sleep then 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.140
 had these two walks out that did not 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.670
 I know if you can see right 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 and then we sleep together in that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.569
 corner and it was our room that after 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.670
 became part of my sister 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.500
 and this room that you were now also 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.269
 the toy room where the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.359
 our toys from a little house with 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.400
 very cool slide and after the 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.959
 reform this room turned mine then 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.120
 after we graduated with a room 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.560
 for each one 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.989
 So, to start, we started. 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.669
 making all the drawers chests all 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.069
 little things we had 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.919
 we could donate and we started to 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.599
 organize things in cash without starting 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.310
 to gather everything they had to 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.319
 donations while the toy the people 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.329
 had to donate and also started to get 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.400
 those little niggling little things offal 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.739
 to play outside that we do not use anymore 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.690
 to this little house that I told you 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.639
 who had agents empty all 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.470
 toys that had within it as 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.900
 You can see that it's okay that my 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.780
 video I think I was nine years old, right? 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.359
 here we filmed in the garage that is 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.000
 where we dismantle the little house in my 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.970
 Mother took me down there and there 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.250
 right in the garage and while our 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.229
 rooms and the retired people had to 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.459
 I slept in the office so I even 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.250
 first night 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.979
 and here are the woodworkers working 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.449
 in their rooms as we used to be. 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.030
 school day would only arrive at night 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.409
 to see the result of each day then the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.590
 people did not see very happy working 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:26.419
 But that day I was able to film and you 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.520
 you can see that these subtitles in 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.530
 pink that you see I did when 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.510
 I was 9 years old so do not call it that. 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.750
 That's when the cabinets were 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.949
 only the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.440
 door right 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.620
 but this day we were also with the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.419
 camera ready and these balls on the wall 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.130
 this part you have already seen in the video 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.710
 all for my room 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.330
 there already had some doors of the 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.740
 cabinets that you also have mobile 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.270
 must have seen that it is where the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.660
 study bench 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.750
 good on this day 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.400
 strange but at last that day is them 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.350
 they were all black because I think he 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.150
 feel the wall already to be able to paint 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.220
 I do not know how it works later. 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.050
 but I think I had to let them 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.700
 they honored the whole room in black 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.980
 so it was very good leaving her 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.530
 The wall knows not to soil the floor 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.510
 they flew and on that day the walls already 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.060
 they were painted this room is mine 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.060
 What the hell are you talking about? 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.340
 and that's it people I took some photos 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.020
 of the project at the time I had the 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.150
 I took the picture and you and I 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.440
 It was not like that for you, not because 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.840
 I did not even know I was going to post this video 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.060
 on youtube but now you can see is the 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.950
 project I think it was super similar 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.740
 with our room it was very similar 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.840
 so the way it's even drawn 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.150
 So these are people if you're new to me. 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.280

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.900

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.100
