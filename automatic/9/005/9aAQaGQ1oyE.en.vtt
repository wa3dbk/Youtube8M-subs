yo Eliot Simon Tyler wants to know if
there<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.049> any<00:00:13.410> form<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.160> cardiovascular

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
there is any form of cardiovascular

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
there is any form of cardiovascular
exercise<00:00:15.949> that<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.520> not<00:00:17.730> only<00:00:18.140> depreciates

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
exercise that that not only depreciates

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.800 
exercise that that not only depreciates
from<00:00:19.949> your<00:00:20.100> ability<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.520> gain<00:00:21.029> muscle<00:00:21.270> build

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
from your ability to gain muscle build

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.689 
from your ability to gain muscle build
muscle<00:00:22.170> mass<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.830> actually<00:00:23.100> adds<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.640> your

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
muscle mass but actually adds to your

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.509 
muscle mass but actually adds to your
ability<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.240> build<00:00:24.660> muscle<00:00:25.019> mass<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.519> muscle

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
ability to build muscle mass so muscle

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.570 
ability to build muscle mass so muscle
building<00:00:26.970> cardio<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.960> there<00:00:28.109> such<00:00:28.320> thing

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
building cardio was not there such thing

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.710 
building cardio was not there such thing
the<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:29.760> first<00:00:29.970> thing<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> only<00:00:30.449> type<00:00:30.689> of

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the very first thing is the only type of

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.920 
the very first thing is the only type of
cardio<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:32.070> has<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> potential<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> detract

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
cardio that has the potential to detract

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.160 
cardio that has the potential to detract
from<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:35.309> gains<00:00:35.930> there<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> couple

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
from your your gains there a couple

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.350 
from your your gains there a couple
different<00:00:37.380> ways<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.530> would<00:00:37.620> approach<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
different ways I would approach this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.479 
different ways I would approach this
would<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.989> depletes<00:00:40.980> glycogen

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
would be that that depletes glycogen

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
would be that that depletes glycogen
right<00:00:42.059> especially<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:42.629> restore<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
right especially if you don't restore it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
right especially if you don't restore it
so<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> high-intensity<00:00:44.370> interval

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so a lot of high-intensity interval

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.930 
so a lot of high-intensity interval
training<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.690> done<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.280> an<00:00:47.460> appropriate

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
training if done in in an appropriate

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.389 
training if done in in an appropriate
fashion<00:00:48.200> especially<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.680> glycogen<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.219> not

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
fashion especially like glycogen is not

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.150 
fashion especially like glycogen is not
replaced<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.329> lead<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.350> flatness<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> your

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
replaced can lead to a flatness in your

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
replaced can lead to a flatness in your
muscle<00:00:53.489> ultimately<00:00:54.329> weakness<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> muscle

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
muscle ultimately weakness and muscle

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
muscle ultimately weakness and muscle
loss<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> degree<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.969> know<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
loss to a degree you know that's not a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
loss to a degree you know that's not a
hundred<00:00:58.739> percent<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.609> typically

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
hundred percent but that's typically

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
hundred percent but that's typically
what<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> avoid<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.890> you're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
what you would want to avoid if you're

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
what you would want to avoid if you're
trying<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> build<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.850> lot<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> muscle<00:01:03.899> mass<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
trying to build a lot of muscle mass is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
trying to build a lot of muscle mass is
the<00:01:04.409> depletion<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.250> vicodin<00:01:05.640> from<00:01:06.119> your

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the depletion of vicodin from your

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
the depletion of vicodin from your
tissue<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.740> thing<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.640> are

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
tissue the other thing is that there are

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
tissue the other thing is that there are
many<00:01:08.850> different<00:01:08.939> types<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.540> cardio<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.500> lead

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
many different types of cardio that lead

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.780 
many different types of cardio that lead
to<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.700> form<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.659> muscle<00:01:13.470> virus<00:01:14.130> muscular

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
to a form of muscle virus muscular

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
to a form of muscle virus muscular
imbalance<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:17.009> due<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
imbalance that's that's due to the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
imbalance that's that's due to the
repetitive<00:01:17.850> motion<00:01:18.180> movements<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
repetitive motion movements right so you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
repetitive motion movements right so you
end<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.850> are<00:01:20.970> called<00:01:23.360> pattern

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
end up with what are called pattern

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780 
end up with what are called pattern
overloads<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> swim<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> lot

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
overloads so if you do if you swim a lot

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
overloads so if you do if you swim a lot
right<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.479> example<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.900> you're

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
right so for example is that you're

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
right so for example is that you're
you're<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> bodybuilder<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.250> benchpress

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you're a bodybuilder you you benchpress

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
you're a bodybuilder you you benchpress
a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> pull<00:01:31.259> downs

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
a lot and you do a lot of pull downs

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.460 
a lot and you do a lot of pull downs
pull<00:01:31.890> ups<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> swim<00:01:33.470> you're

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
pull ups and then you go and swim you're

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.179 
pull ups and then you go and swim you're
further<00:01:34.770> facilitating<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.990> nerve<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
further facilitating the the nerve the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
further facilitating the the nerve the
nervous<00:01:38.490> tension<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.119> those<00:01:39.270> muscles<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
nervous tension in those muscles that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
nervous tension in those muscles that
are<00:01:39.810> associated<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:40.500> bodybuilding<00:01:40.770> by

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
are associated with your bodybuilding by

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.340 
are associated with your bodybuilding by
doing<00:01:41.820> more<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.140> does<00:01:43.229> this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
doing more of this right what does this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
doing more of this right what does this
look<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> push<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
look like it's kind of a push and it's a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
look like it's kind of a push and it's a
pull<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:46.649> doing<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> lot<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
pull your if you're doing a lot of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.679 
pull your if you're doing a lot of
push-ups<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.850> bench<00:01:48.119> presses<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
push-ups a lot of bench presses and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.670 
push-ups a lot of bench presses and
you're<00:01:48.840> doing<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.170> pull<00:01:49.350> downs<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.649> think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you're doing all on pull downs I think

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
you're doing all on pull downs I think
you<00:01:49.829> don't<00:01:49.950> swim<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.640> you're<00:01:51.149> basically

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you don't swim a lot you're basically

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.840 
you don't swim a lot you're basically
asking<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.290> fucked<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.649> shoulders<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
asking for fucked up shoulders right a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
asking for fucked up shoulders right a
better<00:01:54.180> alternative<00:01:54.360> might<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.409> rower

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
better alternative might be like a rower

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.889 
better alternative might be like a rower
machine<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.790> same<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.750> like

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
machine right same thing with like

being<00:02:22.940> destroyed<00:02:23.750> by<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:23.989> pattern<00:02:24.349> overload

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
being destroyed by the pattern overload

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.460 
being destroyed by the pattern overload
of<00:02:25.970> riding<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.420> bike<00:02:26.810> for<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.349> many

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
of riding that bike for so many

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830 
of riding that bike for so many
repetitions<00:02:28.010> those<00:02:28.879> will<00:02:29.090> detract<00:02:29.390> from<00:02:29.569> your

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
repetitions those will detract from your

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.270 
repetitions those will detract from your
gains<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:31.810> now<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.500> good<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:34.040> way<00:02:34.160> I'm

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
gains but now this is good the way I'm

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
gains but now this is good the way I'm
going<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.519> approach<00:02:34.580> how<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.599> will<00:02:36.140> use

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
going to approach how you will use

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.610 
going to approach how you will use
cardio<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.610> add<00:02:37.910> muscle<00:02:38.780> right<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.500> all

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
cardio to add muscle right this is all

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.880 
cardio to add muscle right this is all
very<00:02:39.739> strange<00:02:40.000> it's<00:02:41.000> all<00:02:41.120> very<00:02:41.299> different

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
very strange it's all very different

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.080 
very strange it's all very different

your nervous system is your your

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.319 
your nervous system is your your
autonomic<00:02:51.110> nervous<00:02:51.440> system<00:02:52.069> right<00:02:52.610> that's<00:02:53.209> a

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
autonomic nervous system right that's a

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.940 
autonomic nervous system right that's a
branch<00:02:53.569> of<00:02:53.690> your<00:02:53.810> nervous<00:02:53.989> system<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.620> does

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
branch of your nervous system that does

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.350 
branch of your nervous system that does
things<00:02:55.190> without<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.700> having<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.060> think<00:02:56.090> about

of your nervous system I will have also

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.580 
of your nervous system I will have also
referred<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.239> this<00:03:23.359> as<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.049> vegetative

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
branch of the nervous system because it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.330 
branch of the nervous system because it
vegetated<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.810> does<00:03:26.989> its<00:03:27.230> thing<00:03:27.290> without<00:03:27.709> you

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
vegetated it does its thing without you

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.819 
vegetated it does its thing without you
having<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.760> actively<00:03:29.299> do<00:03:29.569> it<00:03:29.720> it's<00:03:30.620> broken

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
having to actively do it it's broken

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.170 
having to actively do it it's broken
down<00:03:31.160> into<00:03:31.269> two<00:03:32.269> halves<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:33.260> are<00:03:33.470> there<00:03:34.180> like

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
down into two halves that are there like

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.599 
down into two halves that are there like
night<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:35.450> day<00:03:35.660> right<00:03:36.099> there<00:03:37.099> like<00:03:37.340> they're

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
night and day right there like they're

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.550 
night and day right there like they're
complete<00:03:37.940> opposites<00:03:38.450> but<00:03:38.840> they<00:03:38.989> serve<00:03:39.290> one

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
complete opposites but they serve one

another you can't have all day with no

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.990 
another you can't have all day with no
night<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:42.019> can't<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.470> all<00:03:43.000> sympathetic

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
night you can't have all sympathetic

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.009 
night you can't have all sympathetic
stimulation<00:03:45.220> without<00:03:47.019> parasympathetic

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
stimulation without parasympathetic

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.750 
stimulation without parasympathetic
stimulation<00:03:48.319> those<00:03:49.040> are<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> two<00:03:49.489> branches

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
stimulation those are the two branches

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.140 
stimulation those are the two branches
of<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.419> autonomic<00:03:50.599> nervous<00:03:51.049> system<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:52.400> an

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
of the autonomic nervous system right an

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.610 
of the autonomic nervous system right an
interesting<00:03:53.690> thing<00:03:53.870> about<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.319> nervous

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
interesting thing about the nervous

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.050 
interesting thing about the nervous
system<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.269> is<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:57.010> first<00:03:58.060> responder

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
system is that it is the first responder

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.129 
system is that it is the first responder
that<00:03:59.599> later<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.230> you<00:04:01.090> end<00:04:02.090> up<00:04:02.209> having<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
that later on you end up having the the

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.009 
that later on you end up having the the
hormonal<00:04:03.530> system<00:04:03.730> kick<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.450> for<00:04:05.599> example

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
hormonal system kick in so for example

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.740 
hormonal system kick in so for example
like<00:04:06.139> they<00:04:06.470> say<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.739> Marines<00:04:07.069> are<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.370> first

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
like they say the Marines are the first

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.420 
like they say the Marines are the first
responders<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.959> know

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
responders you know

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.430 
responders you know
America<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.550> door<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.910> war<00:04:11.120> first<00:04:11.750> ones<00:04:12.050> in<00:04:12.290> or

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
America is door to war first ones in or

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.380 
America is door to war first ones in or
the<00:04:12.560> Marines<00:04:12.890> right<00:04:13.250> and<00:04:13.490> then<00:04:13.790> later<00:04:14.000> on<00:04:14.240> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
the Marines right and then later on the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.760 
the Marines right and then later on the
Navy<00:04:14.570> will<00:04:14.870> come<00:04:15.050> behind<00:04:15.290> them<00:04:15.530> or<00:04:15.650> whatever

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
Navy will come behind them or whatever

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.250 
Navy will come behind them or whatever
the<00:04:15.890> case<00:04:16.010> may<00:04:16.130> be<00:04:16.160> your<00:04:16.670> nervous<00:04:17.030> system<00:04:17.260> it's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
the case may be your nervous system it's

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.020 
the case may be your nervous system it's
like<00:04:18.320> you're<00:04:18.530> Marines<00:04:18.709> boom<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.550> does<00:04:19.700> things

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
like you're Marines boom it does things

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.120 
like you're Marines boom it does things
first<00:04:20.209> then<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.660> hormonal<00:04:21.020> system<00:04:21.440> follows

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
first then the hormonal system follows

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.180 
first then the hormonal system follows
behind<00:04:22.570> right<00:04:23.570> so<00:04:23.900> for<00:04:24.140> example<00:04:24.470> if<00:04:24.530> i<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:25.100> i

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
behind right so for example if i if i

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.640 
behind right so for example if i if i
dog<00:04:25.510> barks<00:04:26.510> right<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:26.990> if<00:04:27.080> you're<00:04:27.170> just<00:04:27.350> kind

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
dog barks right like if you're just kind

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.830 
dog barks right like if you're just kind
of<00:04:27.710> chillin<00:04:27.980> in<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.190> dog<00:04:28.370> park<00:04:28.580> your<00:04:29.540> nervous

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
of chillin in a dog park your nervous

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.450 
of chillin in a dog park your nervous
system<00:04:29.930> jumps<00:04:30.500> immediately<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.190> like<00:04:31.310> do

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
system jumps immediately so like do

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.920 
system jumps immediately so like do
whatever<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.390> do<00:04:32.540> to

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
whatever it is that you have to do to

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.780 
whatever it is that you have to do to
get<00:04:33.050> help<00:04:33.320> away<00:04:33.620> one<00:04:33.980> bite<00:04:34.280> whatever<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.670> case

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
get help away one bite whatever the case

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.050 
get help away one bite whatever the case
may<00:04:34.910> be

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
may be

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.270 
may be
fight<00:04:35.570> or<00:04:35.720> flight<00:04:36.020> right<00:04:36.860> that's<00:04:37.190> a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
fight or flight right that's a

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.760 
fight or flight right that's a
sympathetic<00:04:37.820> stimulation<00:04:38.450> fight<00:04:39.410> or<00:04:39.530> flight

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
sympathetic stimulation fight or flight

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.100 
sympathetic stimulation fight or flight
and<00:04:39.980> then<00:04:40.610> later<00:04:40.820> on<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.150> catabolic<00:04:41.540> hormones

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
and then later on the catabolic hormones

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.010 
and then later on the catabolic hormones
come<00:04:42.790> associated<00:04:43.790> with<00:04:43.970> what<00:04:44.450> just<00:04:44.660> happened

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
come associated with what just happened

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.310 
come associated with what just happened
the<00:04:45.170> hormones<00:04:45.500> come<00:04:45.710> later<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:48.020> order<00:04:48.170> to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
the hormones come later so in order to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.900 
the hormones come later so in order to
build<00:04:48.590> muscle<00:04:49.780> right<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:51.140> actual<00:04:51.920> anabolic

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
build muscle right the actual anabolic

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.800 
build muscle right the actual anabolic
processes<00:04:53.780> are<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.670> function<00:04:55.670> of<00:04:56.000> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
processes are a function of the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.590 
processes are a function of the
parasympathetic<00:04:57.620> branch<00:04:58.130> of<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:59.240> nervous

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
parasympathetic branch of the nervous

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.110 
parasympathetic branch of the nervous
system<00:04:59.630> right<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.650> used<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.400> use<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.550> chalkboard

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
system right I used to use a chalkboard

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.670 
system right I used to use a chalkboard
to<00:05:02.360> write<00:05:02.510> all<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.810> draw<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.260> shit<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.590> you

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
to write all the draw that shit so you

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680 
to write all the draw that shit so you
guys<00:05:03.800> kept<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.370> visual<00:05:04.730> hopefully<00:05:05.300> my<00:05:05.450> words

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
guys kept a visual hopefully my words

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.480 
guys kept a visual hopefully my words
are<00:05:05.960> poetic<00:05:06.140> enough<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.100> can<00:05:07.280> grasp

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
are poetic enough that you can grasp

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.170 
are poetic enough that you can grasp
what<00:05:07.700> I'm<00:05:07.760> saying

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
what I'm saying

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.850 
what I'm saying
so<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.630> autonomic<00:05:09.260> branch<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.560> your<00:05:09.650> nervous

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
so that autonomic branch of your nervous

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.230 
so that autonomic branch of your nervous
system<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.190> does<00:05:10.400> shit<00:05:10.670> without<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.060> having

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
system that does shit without you having

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.400 
system that does shit without you having
to<00:05:11.360> think<00:05:11.390> about<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.870> dog<00:05:12.050> is<00:05:12.230> barking

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
to think about it that dog is barking

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.110 
to think about it that dog is barking
you're<00:05:13.130> running<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.610> didn't<00:05:13.790> have<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.970> think

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
you're running you didn't have to think

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.350 
you're running you didn't have to think
about<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.480> right<00:05:14.960> also<00:05:15.890> you<00:05:16.790> know<00:05:16.880> that's<00:05:17.060> like

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
about it right also you know that's like

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.030 
about it right also you know that's like
I<00:05:17.450> said<00:05:17.480> that's<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.840> sympathetic<00:05:18.380> stimulus

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
I said that's a sympathetic stimulus

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.200 
I said that's a sympathetic stimulus
also<00:05:19.970> has<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.530> parasympathetic<00:05:21.530> stimulus<00:05:22.370> that

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
also has a parasympathetic stimulus that

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.840 
also has a parasympathetic stimulus that
is<00:05:23.420> not<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.110> catabolic<00:05:24.470> but<00:05:25.040> anabolic<00:05:25.640> I<00:05:25.730> hope

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
is not a catabolic but anabolic I hope

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.570 
is not a catabolic but anabolic I hope
you're<00:05:26.000> following<00:05:26.150> so<00:05:26.750> sympathetic<00:05:27.580> stimulus

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
you're following so sympathetic stimulus

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.800 
you're following so sympathetic stimulus
catabolic<00:05:29.260> breakdown<00:05:30.260> fight-or-flight

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810
