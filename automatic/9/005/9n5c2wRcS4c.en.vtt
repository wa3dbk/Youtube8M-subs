head<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.560> does<00:02:18.830> not<00:02:18.980> go<00:02:19.190> into<00:02:19.370> your<00:02:19.489> ear<00:02:19.730> canal

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
head it does not go into your ear canal

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.949 
head it does not go into your ear canal
so<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.950> comes<00:02:22.250> with<00:02:22.370> two<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.269> these<00:02:23.480> kinds<00:02:23.900> of

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
so it comes with two of these kinds of

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.460 
so it comes with two of these kinds of
things<00:02:24.230> one<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.400> standard<00:02:26.470> doughnut

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
things one is just a standard doughnut

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
things one is just a standard doughnut
hole<00:02:27.650> kind<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.069> thing<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.850> other<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.269> like

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
hole kind of thing the other one is like

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.009 
hole kind of thing the other one is like
that<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.870> has<00:02:30.019> hooks<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.720> frankly<00:02:32.720> this

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
that but it has hooks on it frankly this

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.620 
that but it has hooks on it frankly this
one<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.500> impossible<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.340> use<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:35.120> try<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> use

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
one is impossible to use you try to use

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.870 
one is impossible to use you try to use
this<00:02:35.840> then<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.950> connects<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.430> your<00:02:37.549> ear<00:02:37.730> with

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this then it connects to your ear with

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.250 
this then it connects to your ear with
this<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.330> it's<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.600> be<00:02:38.720> flopping

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
this and it's going to be flopping

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.860 
this and it's going to be flopping
around<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:40.819> one<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.330> little<00:02:41.630> better<00:02:41.750> I

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
around this one is a little better I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.120 
around this one is a little better I
still<00:02:42.200> can't<00:02:42.470> really<00:02:42.620> get<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:42.860> on<00:02:42.950> with<00:02:43.100> one

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
still can't really get it on with one

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.090 
still can't really get it on with one
hand<00:02:43.570> because<00:02:44.570> you've<00:02:44.720> gotta<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.140> well<00:02:46.070> I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
hand because you've gotta like well I

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.009 
hand because you've gotta like well I
guess<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.430> can<00:02:46.609> okay<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.359> okay<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.750> can<00:02:47.900> get

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
guess I can okay like okay I can get

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.750 
guess I can okay like okay I can get
enough<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.440> him<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:48.829> it's<00:02:48.980> not<00:02:49.070> as<00:02:49.430> easy<00:02:49.640> as

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
enough on him but it's not as easy as

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.729 
enough on him but it's not as easy as
some<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.180> other<00:02:50.299> ones<00:02:50.510> now<00:02:51.350> because<00:02:51.620> of

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
some of the other ones now because of

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.569 
some of the other ones now because of
those<00:02:51.829> hooks<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.400> but

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
those hooks it's in but it's it's in but

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.229 
those hooks it's in but it's it's in but
it<00:02:58.670> doesn't<00:02:58.910> feel<00:02:59.500> secure<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:01.760> fallen<00:03:02.120> out

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
it doesn't feel secure it's fallen out

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.030 
it doesn't feel secure it's fallen out
of<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.810> ear<00:03:03.049> part<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.440> couple<00:03:03.680> times<00:03:03.859> it's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
of the ear part a couple times it's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.380 
of the ear part a couple times it's
never<00:03:04.100> fallen<00:03:04.519> off<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.910> year<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.239> it's

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
never fallen off the year because it's

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.569 
never fallen off the year because it's
got<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> hook<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:06.590> not<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.829> secure<00:03:07.250> some

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
got the hook so it's not as secure some

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.460 
got the hook so it's not as secure some
of<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.820> other<00:03:08.019> Bluetooth<00:03:09.019> headsets<00:03:09.350> I've

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
of the other Bluetooth headsets I've

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.039 
of the other Bluetooth headsets I've
used<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:10.609> said<00:03:11.000> I'm<00:03:11.209> giving<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:11.690> four

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
used that said I'm giving this four

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.979 
used that said I'm giving this four
stars<00:03:12.380> because<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.940> said<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.510> connects

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
stars because as I said it connects

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.759 
stars because as I said it connects
really<00:03:15.290> quickly<00:03:16.390> basically<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:17.780> can<00:03:17.930> save<00:03:18.530> so

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
really quickly basically you can save so

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.199 
really quickly basically you can save so
much<00:03:18.890> battery<00:03:19.280> because<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:19.670> often<00:03:19.820> most<00:03:20.090> of

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
much battery because it's often most of

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.240 
much battery because it's often most of
the<00:03:20.269> time<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.600> get<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.720> call<00:03:20.980> turn<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.130> on

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
the time you can get a call turn it on

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.059 
the time you can get a call turn it on
and<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.600> answers<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.350> connects<00:03:24.680> within<00:03:24.980> a

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
and it it answers and connects within a

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:34.170 
and it it answers and connects within a
few<00:03:25.220> seconds

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.670

in<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.650> car<00:03:53.859> driving<00:03:54.159> people<00:03:54.700> don't<00:03:54.939> know<00:03:55.120> that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
in a car driving people don't know that

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.520 
in a car driving people don't know that
I'm<00:03:55.390> driving<00:03:55.810> because<00:03:55.930> they<00:03:56.109> can't<00:03:56.319> hear<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
I'm driving because they can't hear the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.800 
I'm driving because they can't hear the
background<00:03:56.829> noise<00:03:57.209> because<00:03:58.209> it's<00:03:58.390> got<00:03:58.540> very

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
background noise because it's got very

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.860 
background noise because it's got very
good<00:03:58.900> noise<00:03:59.200> cancellation<00:03:59.829> now<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.159> extent<00:04:00.870> in

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
good noise cancellation now in extent in

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.580 
good noise cancellation now in extent in
contrast<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.530> Jabra<00:04:03.900> extreme<00:04:04.900> which<00:04:05.560> is

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
contrast to the Jabra extreme which is

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.369 
contrast to the Jabra extreme which is
the<00:04:06.010> one<00:04:06.129> I<00:04:06.159> reviewed<00:04:06.549> last<00:04:06.700> time<00:04:07.049> this<00:04:08.049> one

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
the one I reviewed last time this one

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.520 
the one I reviewed last time this one
doesn't<00:04:08.950> get<00:04:09.609> better<00:04:09.940> if<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.510> put<00:04:11.109> your<00:04:11.260> hand

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
doesn't get better if you put your hand

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.770 
doesn't get better if you put your hand
like<00:04:11.799> this<00:04:12.190> in<00:04:12.489> fact<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.299> sounds<00:04:13.720> it

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
like this in fact it's it sounds it

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.509 
like this in fact it's it sounds it
basically<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.349> same<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.889> compared<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.370> the

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
basically the same as compared to the

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.849 
basically the same as compared to the
Sun<00:04:15.760> where<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.810> put<00:04:16.989> your<00:04:17.109> hand<00:04:17.320> over<00:04:17.560> it

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
Sun where if you put your hand over it

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.219 
Sun where if you put your hand over it
this<00:04:18.190> how<00:04:18.310> got<00:04:18.549> much<00:04:18.699> better<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.930> sounds

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
couple weeks if they could combine this

connects<00:05:00.760> with<00:05:01.889> just<00:05:02.889> an<00:05:03.039> earbud<00:05:03.810> then<00:05:04.810> that

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
connects with just an earbud then that

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.260 
connects with just an earbud then that
goes<00:05:05.710> inside<00:05:05.919> your<00:05:06.220> hair<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:06.760> it<00:05:06.820> doesn't<00:05:06.880> feel

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
goes inside your hair so it doesn't feel

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.170 
goes inside your hair so it doesn't feel
as<00:05:07.330> precarious<00:05:08.310> then<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.460> would<00:05:09.580> be<00:05:09.699> great<00:05:09.940> it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
as precarious then it would be great it

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.600 
as precarious then it would be great it
would<00:05:10.240> be<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.389> perfect<00:05:10.810> that's<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.280> as<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.520> is

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
would be a perfect that's it as it is

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.339 
would be a perfect that's it as it is
it's<00:05:12.820> not<00:05:12.970> perfect<00:05:13.449> because<00:05:13.659> it<00:05:14.110> still

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
it's not perfect because it still

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.589 
it's not perfect because it still
doesn't<00:05:14.560> feel<00:05:14.940> perfectly<00:05:15.940> secure<00:05:16.300> on<00:05:16.449> your

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
doesn't feel perfectly secure on your

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.810 
doesn't feel perfectly secure on your
head<00:05:16.919> but<00:05:17.919> I<00:05:17.979> haven't<00:05:18.280> had<00:05:18.490> any<00:05:18.639> trouble

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
head but I haven't had any trouble

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.189 
head but I haven't had any trouble
hearing<00:05:19.210> anyone<00:05:19.659> really

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
hearing anyone really

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.870 
hearing anyone really
you<00:05:20.409> can<00:05:20.560> always<00:05:20.680> pump<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.310> volume<00:05:21.669> up<00:05:21.760> to

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
you can always pump the volume up to

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.080 
you can always pump the volume up to
maximum<00:05:22.979> so<00:05:23.979> it's<00:05:24.159> good<00:05:24.340> if<00:05:24.520> they<00:05:24.639> do<00:05:24.699> combine

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
maximum so it's good if they do combine

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.520 
maximum so it's good if they do combine
the<00:05:25.389> two<00:05:25.599> they're<00:05:25.810> going<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:25.990> have<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.229> come<00:05:26.409> up
