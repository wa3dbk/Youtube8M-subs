00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
ring I used to always keep mine on a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.940 
ring I used to always keep mine on a
paper<00:01:30.990> clip<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> had<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.329> my<00:01:33.329> grocery<00:01:33.810> store

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
paper clip I had all of my grocery store

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.330 
paper clip I had all of my grocery store
key<00:01:34.950> cards<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> paper<00:01:35.640> clip<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.860> lost<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
key cards on a paper clip and I lost it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.149 
key cards on a paper clip and I lost it
I<00:01:38.939> lost<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.320> never<00:01:40.380> replace<00:01:40.860> them

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I lost them all and I never replace them

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.690 
I lost them all and I never replace them
so<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.659> would<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.619> suggest<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so I would not suggest that you do this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
so I would not suggest that you do this
perhaps<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.540> called<00:01:45.780> key<00:01:45.990> cards<00:01:46.320> because

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
perhaps they're called key cards because

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.630 
perhaps they're called key cards because
you<00:01:46.649> should<00:01:46.829> keep<00:01:46.979> them<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.399> keys

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you should keep them with your keys

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.080 
you should keep them with your keys
because<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.149> less<00:01:48.299> likely<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.720> lose<00:01:49.020> those

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
because you're less likely to lose those

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
because you're less likely to lose those
it's<00:01:51.090> probably<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.899> better<00:01:52.049> thing<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.380> do

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it's probably the better thing to do

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.910 
it's probably the better thing to do
things<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.149> use<00:01:54.299> these<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.930> can

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
things but you can use these or you can
