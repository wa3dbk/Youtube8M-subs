video<00:00:01.439> comparing<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.310> iPhone<00:00:02.879> 6<00:00:03.300> vs<00:00:03.810> the

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
video comparing the iPhone 6 vs the

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.769 
video comparing the iPhone 6 vs the
iPhone<00:00:04.259> 5s<00:00:04.830> here<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> little<00:00:05.310> bit<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.779> there

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
iPhone 5s here a little bit and there

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.629 
iPhone 5s here a little bit and there
really<00:00:07.080> isn't<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.529> much<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.980> compare

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
really isn't that much to compare

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.610 
really isn't that much to compare
obviously<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> main<00:00:09.660> key<00:00:09.990> thing<00:00:10.349> here<00:00:10.590> that

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
obviously the main key thing here that

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.150 
obviously the main key thing here that
Apple<00:00:11.070> has<00:00:11.280> updated<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> screen<00:00:13.530> size<00:00:13.799> of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
Apple has updated is the screen size of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.260 
Apple has updated is the screen size of
4.7<00:00:14.849> inch<00:00:15.000> instead<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.279> 4-inch<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> this

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
4.7 inch instead of a 4-inch and this

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.210 
4.7 inch instead of a 4-inch and this
was<00:00:18.420> pretty<00:00:18.570> funny<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.230> posted<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.100> an

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
was pretty funny because I posted in an

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.290 
was pretty funny because I posted in an
ad<00:00:20.570> 2012<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.990> men<00:00:22.769> also<00:00:23.130> they<00:00:23.880> said<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
ad 2012 that men also they said in the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.150 
ad 2012 that men also they said in the
past<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.720> 4<00:00:25.439> inch<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> perfect<00:00:26.460> size<00:00:26.990> but

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
past that 4 inch is the perfect size but

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.380 
past that 4 inch is the perfect size but
apparently<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.369> were<00:00:29.429> wrong<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.330> are

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
apparently they were wrong now they are

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.959 
apparently they were wrong now they are
updating<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.260> they<00:00:31.710> had<00:00:31.920> an<00:00:32.070> ad<00:00:32.250> where<00:00:32.820> they

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
updating and they had an ad where they

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
updating and they had an ad where they
were<00:00:33.059> saying<00:00:33.300> oh<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.989> reach<00:00:34.140> everything

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
were saying oh you can reach everything

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
were saying oh you can reach everything
with<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.160> thumb<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> amazing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
with your thumb and it was like amazing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.790 
with your thumb and it was like amazing
and<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> stuff<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.649> are

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and all that stuff but now they are

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
and all that stuff but now they are
creating<00:00:41.040> finally<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
creating finally so they they kind of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.569 
creating finally so they they kind of
say<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.230> something<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.129> right<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
say that that something was right you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
say that that something was right you
know<00:00:44.640> bigger<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.210> better

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
know bigger is better

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.000 
know bigger is better
but<00:00:47.000> this<00:00:48.000> 1/4<00:00:48.570> inch<00:00:48.719> aside<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.559> again<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
but this 1/4 inch aside there again and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.200 
but this 1/4 inch aside there again and
this<00:00:51.050> 1/4<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.350> inch<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
this 1/4 of an inch this one I think is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
this 1/4 of an inch this one I think is
the<00:00:54.300> perfect<00:00:54.690> size<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.410> lucky<00:00:55.649> use

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the perfect size because one lucky use

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
the perfect size because one lucky use
if<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:56.520> used<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.210> bigger<00:00:57.870> phones

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
if you're used to like bigger phones

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
if you're used to like bigger phones
this<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> perfect<00:00:59.789> size<00:01:00.510> for

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
this one is like the perfect size for

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.779 
this one is like the perfect size for
phone<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.350> don't<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> phones<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
phone I don't think the phones need to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.240 
phone I don't think the phones need to
be<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.329> much<00:01:03.539> bigger<00:01:03.809> than<00:01:04.320> 4.7<00:01:04.979> inch<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
be that much bigger than 4.7 inch I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.530 
be that much bigger than 4.7 inch I
think<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> most

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
think that's like one of the most

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.960 
think that's like one of the most
optimal<00:01:07.080> phone<00:01:07.710> sizes<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
optimal phone sizes out there at the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
optimal phone sizes out there at the
moment<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:11.119> there<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.180> smaller<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.689> updates

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
moment but there are smaller up updates

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.530 
moment but there are smaller up updates
here<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> glass<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here you can see that the glass on the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.510 
here you can see that the glass on the
front<00:01:15.960> side<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.880> bit<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.330> again<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
front side is a little bit like again it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.609 
front side is a little bit like again it
goes<00:01:20.520> down<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> sides<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.380> enjoy

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
goes down on the sides which I do enjoy

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.280 
goes down on the sides which I do enjoy
it<00:01:23.240> becomes<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.540> more<00:01:24.780> soft<00:01:25.049> on

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it becomes a little bit more soft on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100 
it becomes a little bit more soft on
sides<00:01:25.939> compared<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> iPhone<00:01:27.420> 5s<00:01:27.840> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
sides compared to the iPhone 5s that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
sides compared to the iPhone 5s that's
limit<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.040> harder<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.610> sides<00:01:29.909> also<00:01:30.509> her

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
limit way more harder on sides also her

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.330 
limit way more harder on sides also her
the<00:01:30.840> touch<00:01:31.079> ID<00:01:31.350> should<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.159> bit

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the touch ID should be a little bit

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.480 
the touch ID should be a little bit
faster<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.299> might<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.960> test<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
faster so I might do a test with that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.010 
faster so I might do a test with that
and<00:01:36.290> even<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.860> even<00:01:38.400> though<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.570> screen

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and even the even though the this screen

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
and even the even though the this screen
is<00:01:40.140> bigger<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.250> has<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> same<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
is bigger and it has the same kind of

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.530 
is bigger and it has the same kind of
Peaks<00:01:42.570> pixel<00:01:43.140> density<00:01:43.970> which<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.270> little

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
Peaks pixel density which is a little

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.080 
Peaks pixel density which is a little
bit<00:01:45.630> higher<00:01:46.430> resolution<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.610> increase<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
bit higher resolution they increase it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.149 
bit higher resolution they increase it
bumped<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> resolution<00:01:48.869> from<00:01:49.140> 640<00:01:49.680> x<00:01:49.799> 11

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
bumped up the resolution from 640 x 11

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.319 
bumped up the resolution from 640 x 11
36<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> 5s<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.750> 750<00:01:52.439> tons<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.979> 30<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> 34<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
36 on the 5s to 750 tons of 30 and 34 I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.670 
36 on the 5s to 750 tons of 30 and 34 I
think<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.869> maybe<00:01:54.899> 15<00:01:55.649> 34<00:01:56.540> but<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.869> 13<00:01:58.380> 34

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
think or maybe 15 34 but I think 13 34

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.179 
think or maybe 15 34 but I think 13 34
so<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.820> still<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:02.180> 326<00:02:03.200> PPI<00:02:04.200> which

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so it's still think on a 326 PPI which

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.719 
so it's still think on a 326 PPI which
is<00:02:05.340> interesting<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.719> comes<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.409> bow<00:02:07.560> aah

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is interesting it comes with a bow aah

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.280 
is interesting it comes with a bow aah
of<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:10.310> instead<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> Apple<00:02:12.030> a7<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.659> I<00:02:12.900> think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of them instead of Apple a7 so I think

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
of them instead of Apple a7 so I think
it's<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.670> 25%<00:02:14.670> faster<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:16.409> normal<00:02:17.099> or

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it's like 25% faster and in normal or

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
it's like 25% faster and in normal or
not<00:02:18.239> normal<00:02:18.299> everyday<00:02:19.170> performance<00:02:19.739> that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
not normal everyday performance that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.250 
not normal everyday performance that
you're<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.129> see<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> little

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
you're going to see but it is a little

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.380 
you're going to see but it is a little
bit<00:02:22.409> faster<00:02:22.560> looped<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.220> clocked<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.730> home<00:02:24.180> but

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
bit faster looped I clocked you home but

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.059 
bit faster looped I clocked you home but
forgi<00:02:24.659> hurts<00:02:24.840> instead<00:02:25.049> of<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.319> quote<00:02:25.590> doing<00:02:25.980> it

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
forgi hurts instead of do quote doing it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.729 
forgi hurts instead of do quote doing it
hurts<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.879> GPUs<00:02:27.390> also<00:02:27.780> been<00:02:27.930> updated<00:02:28.080> from

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
hurts the GPUs also been updated from

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.800 
hurts the GPUs also been updated from

the the power bi x64 32 64 50 and the
battery<00:02:34.200> life<00:02:34.860> should<00:02:35.129> also<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> little<00:02:35.549> bit

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
battery life should also be a little bit

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250 
battery life should also be a little bit
better<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.269> especially<00:02:36.569> graphics<00:02:37.110> I've

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
better but it especially graphics I've

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.860 
better but it especially graphics I've
heard<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.530> should<00:02:37.709> be<00:02:37.799> like<00:02:37.950> 50%<00:02:38.400> better<00:02:38.870> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
heard it should be like 50% better so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.470 
heard it should be like 50% better so
that's<00:02:40.049> definitely<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.799> future<00:02:41.220> proof<00:02:41.489> it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
that's definitely like future proof it

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.900 
that's definitely like future proof it
definitely<00:02:42.989> will<00:02:43.140> handle<00:02:44.069> graphic<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.790> stuff

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
definitely will handle graphic and stuff

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.190 
definitely will handle graphic and stuff
like<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.120> probably<00:02:45.510> way<00:02:45.660> better<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
like that probably way better in the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.130 
like that probably way better in the
future<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.650> course<00:02:46.890> software<00:02:47.340> wise<00:02:47.609> they<00:02:47.879> are

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
future of course software wise they are

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.449 
future of course software wise they are
identical<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.920> there<00:02:50.069> are<00:02:50.129> some<00:02:50.310> other

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
identical but there are some other

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.900 
identical but there are some other
things<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.950> little<00:02:52.950> bit<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.370> thinner

be improved a little bit here slightly
and<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:23.639> we<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:23.849> have<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.269> in<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.780> camera

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
the DM iPhone 6 you can see I can change

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.180 
the DM iPhone 6 you can see I can change
there<00:03:42.150> from<00:03:42.419> different<00:03:42.569> modes<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.950> go

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
there from different modes but if I go

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.009 
there from different modes but if I go

into the to the iPhone 5s here you can

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.619 
into the to the iPhone 5s here you can
see<00:03:49.169> I<00:03:49.200> can<00:03:49.440> only<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.799> on<00:03:50.239> 120<00:03:51.239> frames<00:03:51.359> per

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
see I can only be on 120 frames per

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.509 
see I can only be on 120 frames per
second<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.139> even<00:03:52.680> more<00:03:52.829> slow<00:03:53.040> motion<00:03:53.370> that's

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
second so even more slow motion that's

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.640 
second so even more slow motion that's
nice<00:03:53.669> but<00:03:54.389> there<00:03:54.780> are<00:03:54.840> some<00:03:55.019> negatives<00:03:55.410> still

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650

to<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.760> 40<00:04:02.760> iPhone<00:04:03.090> 6<00:04:03.359> plus<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:04.019> like<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.200> new

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
to be 40 iPhone 6 plus with like a new

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.189 
to be 40 iPhone 6 plus with like a new
sensor<00:04:04.769> from<00:04:05.099> what<00:04:05.250> I've<00:04:05.340> heard<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:06.019> do<00:04:07.019> have

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
sensor from what I've heard you do have

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.289 
sensor from what I've heard you do have
also<00:04:07.379> if<00:04:07.889> you<00:04:08.220> do<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.609> this<00:04:08.760> display<00:04:09.090> still

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
also if you do think this display still

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.670 
also if you do think this display still
a<00:04:09.329> little<00:04:09.480> bit<00:04:09.629> too<00:04:09.660> big<00:04:09.959> sometimes<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.530> can

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
a little bit too big sometimes you can

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.789 
a little bit too big sometimes you can
double<00:04:11.400> tap<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.970> home<00:04:12.090> button<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.799> I

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
double tap on the home button and I

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.409 
double tap on the home button and I
think<00:04:14.040> they<00:04:14.160> call<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.489> like<00:04:14.699> reach<00:04:14.910> ability

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
think they call this like reach ability

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.080 
think they call this like reach ability
so<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.590> pretty<00:04:16.709> cool<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.340> works<00:04:17.549> in<00:04:17.729> here<00:04:17.760> as

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
so it's pretty cool it works in here as

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.240 
so it's pretty cool it works in here as
well<00:04:18.329> when<00:04:18.690> you're<00:04:19.070> somewhere

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
well when you're somewhere

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.420 
well when you're somewhere
double<00:04:20.820> tap

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
double tap

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.370 
double tap
and<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.669> makes<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:21.970> smaller<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:23.020> definitely

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and it makes it smaller so I definitely

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.990 
and it makes it smaller so I definitely
might<00:04:23.680> do<00:04:23.800> more<00:04:23.949> videos<00:04:24.280> comparing<00:04:24.490> these<00:04:24.759> two

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
might do more videos comparing these two

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.390 
might do more videos comparing these two
but<00:04:25.300> there<00:04:25.960> really<00:04:26.199> isn't<00:04:26.500> have<00:04:26.919> much<00:04:27.160> more

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
but there really isn't have much more

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.510 
but there really isn't have much more
new<00:04:27.669> here<00:04:28.389> to<00:04:29.139> talk<00:04:29.320> about<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:30.100> main<00:04:30.310> key

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
new here to talk about the main key

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.810 
new here to talk about the main key
thing<00:04:30.789> definitely<00:04:31.090> will<00:04:31.539> be<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:32.050> screen<00:04:32.350> size

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
thing definitely will be the screen size

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.240 
thing definitely will be the screen size
and<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.509> design<00:04:35.020> update<00:04:35.289> which<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.889> do<00:04:35.949> enjoy

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
and the design update which I do enjoy

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.580 
and the design update which I do enjoy
and<00:04:36.729> it<00:04:37.479> sound<00:04:37.690> probably<00:04:38.169> smells<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.470> little

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
and it sound probably smells a little

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.570 
and it sound probably smells a little
bit<00:04:38.740> different<00:04:39.070> but<00:04:39.190> overall<00:04:40.169> most<00:04:41.169> things

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
bit different but overall most things

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.270 
bit different but overall most things
are<00:04:42.580> pretty<00:04:43.270> much<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.660> same<00:04:43.690> so<00:04:44.680> what<00:04:45.009> you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
are pretty much the same so what you

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.219 
are pretty much the same so what you
quickly<00:04:45.639> look<00:04:45.910> here<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.600> can<00:04:46.750> also<00:04:46.870> see<00:04:47.050> the

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
quickly look here you can also see the

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.749 
quickly look here you can also see the
button<00:04:47.650> update<00:04:47.800> here<00:04:48.370> pretty<00:04:49.240> nice<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.720> think

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
button update here pretty nice I think

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.950 
button update here pretty nice I think
so<00:04:52.050> what<00:04:53.050> do<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.199> think<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:55.419> that<00:04:55.600> big<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:55.810> an

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
so what do you think not that big of an

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.330 
so what do you think not that big of an
update<00:04:56.229> yeah<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:57.100> kind<00:04:57.789> of<00:04:57.820> agree<00:04:58.440> but<00:04:59.440> step<00:04:59.889> fun

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.800 
update yeah I kind of agree but step fun
to<00:05:00.490> compare<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.240> definitely<00:05:01.389> might<00:05:01.660> do

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
to compare and I definitely might do

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.939 
to compare and I definitely might do
more<00:05:01.930> comparison<00:05:02.440> if<00:05:02.650> like<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:02.979> if<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.340> want
