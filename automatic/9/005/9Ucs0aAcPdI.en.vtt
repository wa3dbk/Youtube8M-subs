is<00:00:10.700> a<00:00:10.760> rod-shaped<00:00:11.150> bacteria<00:00:12.050> so<00:00:12.500> you<00:00:12.559> need<00:00:12.950> to

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
is a rod-shaped bacteria so you need to

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.700 
is a rod-shaped bacteria so you need to
draw<00:00:13.250> an<00:00:13.429> oblong<00:00:13.880> shape<00:00:14.200> this<00:00:15.200> is<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.500> inner

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
draw an oblong shape this is the inner

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.830 
draw an oblong shape this is the inner
layer<00:00:16.180> and<00:00:17.180> you're<00:00:17.360> actually<00:00:17.570> going<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.750> draw

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
layer and you're actually going to draw

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.979 
layer and you're actually going to draw
three<00:00:18.140> layers<00:00:18.700> I'm<00:00:19.700> leaving<00:00:20.540> a<00:00:20.599> little<00:00:20.810> bit<00:00:20.899> of

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:20.989 
three layers I'm leaving a little bit of

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.810 
three layers I'm leaving a little bit of
a<00:00:21.050> gap<00:00:21.230> down<00:00:21.529> here<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.160> reason<00:00:22.520> will<00:00:22.700> be

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
a gap down here the reason will be

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.929 
a gap down here the reason will be
apparent<00:00:23.180> in<00:00:23.599> a<00:00:23.689> minute<00:00:24.520> so<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.640> inner<00:00:25.730> layer

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
apparent in a minute so the inner layer

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.299 
apparent in a minute so the inner layer
is<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.360> cell<00:00:26.570> membrane<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.290> way<00:00:27.890> I'm<00:00:28.040> drawing

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
is the cell membrane the way I'm drawing

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.780 
is the cell membrane the way I'm drawing
now<00:00:28.520> is<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:28.939> cell<00:00:29.180> wall<00:00:29.509> and<00:00:30.250> this<00:00:31.250> outside

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
now is the cell wall and this outside

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:44.260 
now is the cell wall and this outside
layer<00:00:31.970> here<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.419> called<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.260> capsule<00:00:43.270> unless

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
layer here is called the capsule unless

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.150 
layer here is called the capsule unless
you<00:00:44.390> get<00:00:44.570> there<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.440> can<00:00:45.620> draw<00:00:45.830> in<00:00:45.980> a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
you get there so that I can draw in a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:01:04.530 
you get there so that I can draw in a
flagellum<00:00:54.940> just<00:00:55.940> label<00:00:56.239> those<00:00:56.440> cell<00:00:57.440> membrane

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:20.970 

cell<00:01:05.230> wall<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:10.620> capsule<00:01:19.410> now<00:01:20.410> for<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.680> inside

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
cell wall and capsule now for the inside

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.010 
cell wall and capsule now for the inside
it's<00:01:21.250> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.640> draw<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> few<00:01:25.270> loops<00:01:25.630> here

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
it's going to draw a few loops here

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:37.510 
it's going to draw a few loops here
these<00:01:26.500> are<00:01:26.950> plasmids

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.370 

and<00:01:37.610> these<00:01:38.600> little<00:01:38.990> dots<00:01:39.439> here<00:01:39.799> are<00:01:40.159> ribosomes

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
and these little dots here are ribosomes

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.859 
and these little dots here are ribosomes
they're<00:01:42.380> smaller<00:01:42.770> than<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.420> eukaryotic<00:01:44.420> cells

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
they're smaller than in eukaryotic cells

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:56.800 
they're smaller than in eukaryotic cells
these<00:01:45.170> are<00:01:45.250> 70s<00:01:46.780> ribosomes<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:56.539> bit<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.750> a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
these are 70s ribosomes and a bit of a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.749 
these are 70s ribosomes and a bit of a
squiggle<00:01:57.200> here<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.799> should<00:01:58.039> make<00:01:58.250> sure<00:01:58.520> that

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
squiggle here you should make sure that

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.960 
squiggle here you should make sure that
when<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.000> draw<00:01:59.299> it<00:01:59.479> it<00:02:00.080> looks<00:02:00.259> like<00:02:00.470> it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
when you draw it it looks like it

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.010 
when you draw it it looks like it
matches<00:02:01.970> up<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.479> don't<00:02:02.630> have<00:02:02.720> any<00:02:02.869> loose

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
matches up and you don't have any loose

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.580 
matches up and you don't have any loose
ends<00:02:03.970> that's<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.210> DNA<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.720> cell<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.320> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
ends that's the DNA in the cell and the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.500 
ends that's the DNA in the cell and the
zone<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:06.979> it's<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.759> called<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.179> nucleoid

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
zone that it's in is called the nucleoid

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
zone that it's in is called the nucleoid
so<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.720> missed<00:02:11.900> out<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:18.250> label<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
so just missed out the I in label the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.020 
so just missed out the I in label the
flagellum<00:02:20.110> torille<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.440> flagella<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
flagellum torille is flagella and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.920 
flagellum torille is flagella and
there's<00:02:26.870> one<00:02:27.140> more<00:02:27.290> thing<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.650> want<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.830> add<00:02:28.930> I'm

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
there's one more thing I want to add I'm

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.180 
there's one more thing I want to add I'm
gonna<00:02:30.080> put<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> heap<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.560> strokes<00:02:30.860> here

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
gonna put a heap of strokes here

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.410 
gonna put a heap of strokes here
extending<00:02:31.819> out<00:02:31.970> from<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.799> membrane<00:02:33.799> and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
extending out from the membrane and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.920 
extending out from the membrane and
these<00:02:35.420> are<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.349> pili

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
these are the pili

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.600 
these are the pili
so<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> pili<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.500> flagellum<00:02:40.069> make<00:02:40.370> sure

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
so the pili and the flagellum make sure

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.699 
so the pili and the flagellum make sure
they're<00:02:40.819> both<00:02:41.060> attached<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.660> your<00:02:41.840> cell

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
they're both attached to your cell

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.380 
they're both attached to your cell
membrane<00:02:43.100> don't<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.640> them<00:02:43.790> hanging<00:02:44.090> off<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
membrane don't have them hanging off the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.430 
membrane don't have them hanging off the
wall<00:02:47.410> label<00:02:48.410> them<00:02:48.560> as<00:02:48.920> pili<00:02:51.760> singular<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:53.440> kill

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
wall label them as pili singular is kill

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.600 
wall label them as pili singular is kill
us<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:56.470> that's<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.250> an<00:02:58.549> e.coli<00:02:59.090> here
