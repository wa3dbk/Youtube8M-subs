00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.220
 Volkswagen is as the name implies the car for the people, that's why it is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 Hardly surprising the Volkswagen since Monday 48 in Germany most 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 Builds cars 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.179
 but why 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.759
 is the VW actually so popular with the people 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.780
 Every tenth person in the world now has a Volkswagen in Western Europe 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.130
 even every fifth 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.430
 In total, 603 million Volkswagen sold worldwide in 2009 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.950
 To better understand Volkswagen 's myth of driving into the parent plant in Wolfsburg 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.840
 Lower Saxony with almost 50,000 employees 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.920
 supposedly four out of five cars are supposed to be on the Volkswagen street 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.960
 why are you actually doing a VW? 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.330
 Volkswagen is soliciting it yourself great car is that already 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.690
 more than a hero long mile north axis 120 tons km and there hardly 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.790
 repairs 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.990
 what you noticed was that in the corner there is even a car of your own 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.750
 instead of in the middle of the city the volkswagen team 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.950
 the ideal place to get a feel for the popular car in what way 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.660
 Volkswagen has now gone through a lifestyle since the 50s 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.560
 give the beetle the feeling of freedom 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.990
 which I also transferred well to the van from the first to the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.330
 fifth generation with the topic of individual travel 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 I would like to play this feeling of life first 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 on 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.620
 you see the players 11 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.070
 the attitude to life that Volkswagen represents 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.500
 I drive on to the VP Tuning Team in the city of Neubrandenburg der 24 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.760
 Millions sold VW Golf 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.950
 As the second bestselling car behind the Toyota Corolla has in the world 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 this point a very special place 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 why have the piled up Golf and Jetta sports cars 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.669
 we want to do the discreet 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.459
 the performance rises in secret to the modules like the plague 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 under the title we are here 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.229
 the gulf as a wolf in sheep's clothing 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:42.590
 Volkswagen has built these characteristic cars, too, a car is then resting 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.010
 if I can carry as many people as possible the sales will be 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.649
 VW Beetle VW Caddy percent 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.160
 my BMW and Hummer 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.729
 and the VW Golf 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.559
 against each other 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.659
 a VW Beetle fit three people in the back seat 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.059
 one of them is Aigner did not call and a medial six 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.439
 People okay 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.159
 the VW k70 is a four-door and creates people in the back seat here 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.249
 three more people in front of me Â»politics of the blockbuster three people fit in the 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.189
 Trunk times the channel 70 has room for ten people 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.979
 now my BMW 18 0 2 timed Tim k 70 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.429
 Four rows fit in the back and more is not possible in the front 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.419
 After all, professionals 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:33.769
 the VW Golf wants to show it all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 a new record 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.389
 but only with MobileIron 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:41.589
 the k 70 is the clear winner although he only sold 220 break 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.919
 For decades, Volkswagen has made a name for itself as a quality brand 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.079
 Mediator of an attitude to life 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.129
 That's why Volkswagen drives despite the ongoing economic crisis 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.930
 Optimistic about the future this week, the search for the truth continues 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.029
 about Germany
