is really not the best option because by

retreatment does not work it would be to

patient was interested in keeping it and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
patient was interested in keeping it and
as<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> result<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.810> decided<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.259> make<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> very

seem to have a significant lesion and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.120 
seem to have a significant lesion and
then<00:01:27.030> skip<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.570> panel<00:01:28.049> root<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.740> skipped<00:01:29.040> a

and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.850> extend<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> include<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> panel

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

Ridge<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:51.090> made<00:01:51.390> an<00:01:51.509> access<00:01:51.990> opening

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
Ridge so we I made an access opening

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.679 
Ridge so we I made an access opening
through<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> top<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> tooth<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.909> exposed

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
through the top of the tooth and exposed

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.709 
through the top of the tooth and exposed
the<00:01:54.840> mb1<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.560> found<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.250> MB<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> aid

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the mb1 and found the MB to what the aid

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
the mb1 and found the MB to what the aid
of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.990> microscope<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:59.189> usual<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.820> little<00:02:00.060> bit

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
of the microscope as usual a little bit

of the microscope as usual a little bit
more<00:02:00.680> about<00:02:01.680> 2<00:02:01.920> millimeter<00:02:02.310> lingual<00:02:02.820> and
