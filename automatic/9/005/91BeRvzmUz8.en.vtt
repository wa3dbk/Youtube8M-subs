 was not hot that's for sure I'm 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.180
 point that tells you nothing but I 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.680
 could not I can think better ah 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.700
 well yes we think yes so we know 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.470
 where we do not know but no they 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.670
 think thinkers generation 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.020
 what do we track after noon we 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.280
 thinks everyone thinks then 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.180
 go think about it we could 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.620
 maybe already started with what we 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.720
 calls for a production that even admits 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.920
 introduce subject because two choices and in 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.500
 a development with an argumentation 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.060
 very specific you make me arguments 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.739
 more example and in a conclusion 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.790
 personal you do not give your 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.440
 opinion because it does not interest me but 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.489
 least an opening on another subject 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.950
 for that is debatable 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.870
 so I listen to you see the war 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.650
 cold the cold war way of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.730
 strategic confrontation and 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.170
 policies between the eastern bloc 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.819
 characterized by the united states 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.620
 of north america and the west block 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.000
 characterized by the Soviet of the ex 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.290
 right here what were the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.640
 actors who have seven hours intervenes 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.750
 after the second world war this 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.170
 that you have to know is that the expression 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.500
 well cold excused for what you 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.910

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200

 less easy like that ben necessarily 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.930
 since we have no price we do not have the
