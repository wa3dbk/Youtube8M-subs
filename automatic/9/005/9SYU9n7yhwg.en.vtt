00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.200
 quite a lot of candy buying german like that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 For example, kids rule I have three 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.469

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.469

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 I have three guest houses at home 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.330
 a lot of things bought around the one 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.580
 argue then I have like 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:21.689
 bought many 10 mill. potatoes 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:24.560
 I have several I once 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.150
 bought two packs 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 that's cool yes that was it too 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.689
 the sweets full I have it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.689
 bent and that is 51 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.010
 then I have been here you can offer everywhere 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.770
 from Hanover, such a great one 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.050
 nice if they are at the fridge 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.200
 then I asked such a question 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.530
 which was relatively little effort in amazon 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.630
 then order a hanover book that is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.550
 in the languages ​​german english and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.200
 Spanish 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.520
 and there are pictures in it and small texts 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.520
 and yes I found it to be pretty 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.700
 no idea maybe you know something 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:25.780
 start with it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:27.000
 i thought a calendar was made with 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 own pictures 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.330
 I think it's cool here 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.330
 example is on mainufer or 4 690 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.830
 maschsee and so that's really 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.090
 quite elaborate a calendar of 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.250
 By the way, from september to august goes 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.290
 and in German what's the same to me 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.600
 yesterday only noticed on monday 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.380
 tuesday wednesday and so on and me 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.610
 I've done my castle what actually 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.950
 I think that's a really good idea 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.950
 because I just gave it up 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.040
 from the 26th 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.560
 april I started with it I have 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.530
 stop is like a diary led all the way 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.880
 many pictures are glued in and out 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.739
 I simply fell asleep 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.440
 and my room for example, also mr 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.660
 presented and so on 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.150
 I like it very much on the like 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:38.110
 because it's something personal for mine 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.110
 host sister I have two then 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.000
 is about resolution 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.140
 but I do not know what I mean so me 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.970
 just thought that I mean mine 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.140
 Guest brother simply as sweets 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.260
 I do n't know so much about it 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620
 cope 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.290
 That's what you were my guest 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.060
 I also have now from the fw 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.269
 recently received letters 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.760
 there was, for example, the beautiful cover for 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.920
 my pastor a sign where I the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.480
 address on it can write that me 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.950
 a suitcase can hang here is already 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.780
 what I mean I would have then yes 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.610
 The guide was still in there so that 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.540
 I know who I call such flight 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.910
 fit or something 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.280
 So important things were in there and 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.700
 that was actually the last letter 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.320
 beautiful 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.300
 i will fly soon in five days 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.820
 which is then so clear that they farewell 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.200
 take good must hold my next goal 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.100
 then stops before I fly over the 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.660
 packing the suitcase 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.520
 By the way, I do not have it yet 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.110
 started just because I have this video 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.210
 wants to do and then everything so 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.460
 want to do together with video 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.990
 otherwise I do not know 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.520
 I will do it as accurately as possible 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.889
 I feel it will not be accurate 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:55.310
 but let yourself be surprised then yes mine 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.960
 penultimate video from germany think 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.530
 I'll see you then until the 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.530
 next time
