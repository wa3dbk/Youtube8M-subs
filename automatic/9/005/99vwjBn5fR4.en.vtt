 this is just a small interview for the newspaper 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:27.810
 just a couple of questions mr gray 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:27.810
 waiting for you and how polite and strong you are 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.120
 dangerous 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.300
 what are you interested in besides work and you 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:59.090

 just saw a man that's how it will be 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.130
 for them to break away from you 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.960
 Scully I have a difficult past 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.369
 romantic my tastes are rather unusual 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.369
 I'm afraid you will not understand 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.290
