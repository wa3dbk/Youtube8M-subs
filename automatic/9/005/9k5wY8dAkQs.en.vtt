00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:04.968
 (happy music) 

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.135
 - Welcome back to "Cute Girl Hairstyle", I am Kamri. 

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:14.854
 - I am Mindy. Today we will show you 

00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:17.001
 How to comb a lace fishtail. 

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.194

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.020
 To do this hairstyle, you need 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.550
 A donut puller that matches the color of your hair. 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.933
 You can see it on Camry's head. 

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.335
 Lower your head, I just separated the middle part, 

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:36.076
 There is a French fishtail on the top of the head. 

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:38.955
 This will make the hairstyle look a little more beautiful. 

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.416
 Now use your donuts, 

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.957
 Split a part of the hair, like this, 

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.151
 Need a certain amount of hair, 

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:50.680
 Almost one-sixth of the entire hair. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.316
 I mean we need to leave enough hair. 

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:54.569
 Then use the donuts 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:57.216
 Pass the rest through its center, 

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:00.698
 Let the hair fall naturally, almost 

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:02.805
 Covered the hair puller, 

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:06.421
 Spread evenly around it. 

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.662
 When you let your hair spread evenly, 

00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:10.334
 The bottom part is here, 

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.260
 You need to mention a part of the hair here. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.732
 Similarly, a certain amount of hair is needed, 

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:17.695
 But not very much, they will constitute 

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:20.770
 The first two parts of your fishtail, 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.977
 Just like your main share, you will start here. 

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:25.995
 Then we are going to make a knot of the common fishtail, 

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.711
 Take a little hair on the outer edge, 

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.114
 Cross it and add it to the bottom of the hair. 

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.737
 Use a little more of this side of the hair, 

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:38.219
 Cross it and add it to the top of the hair. 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.634
 This is a knot of the basic fishtail. 

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:43.153
 In the second knot of the series 

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:44.976
 Add some hair, 

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:47.635
 So we have to take a small strand of hair here, 

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:51.235
 Then take a small strand on the outer edge. 

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:53.474
 Cross them together across the top 

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.669
 And add to the bottom part. 

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:58.421
 Of course, there is no hair added to the bottom part. 

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:01.217
 So you don't have to add any more. 

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:03.574
 We will take another part of the hair on the outer edge, 

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:06.338
 Cross it to join the next share. 

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:08.893
 Again, this is the basic knot, 

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:10.495
 A full circle around the hairpin. 

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:12.721
 Take a small strand of hair, 

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:17.637
 Pick a part of the outer edge from that part, 

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:21.069
 Cross it over the top and add it to the bottom part, 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.113
 Take a portion of the outer edge from the bottom portion, 

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:27.712
 Cross it back and join the top section. 

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.196
 Then repeat it again and again, again and again, 

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:31.972
 Until the entire hairpin is covered. 

00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:36.972
 (happy music) 

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.436
 When you are done at the end, 

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:42.397
 There is no hair available, 

00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:44.534
 Then you continue, 

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:47.278
 Make an ordinary fishtail. 

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.086
 Slightly longer, this will 

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:52.770
 Let's have a little more fishtail to put it 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.670
 Hiding under the scorpion makes it look beautiful. 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.555
 (happy music) 

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.984
 Ok, now you can see 

00:03:01.984 --> 00:03:03.504
 The scorpion has been compiled, 

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:05.536
 I started here and made it a circle around the hairpin. 

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.520
 You can move it like this. 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.101
 If you don't want to leave the hair tail here, 

00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.481
 If you want to hide it under the hairpin, 

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.919
 It's flexible, you can move it to 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.255
 Anywhere you want. 

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:17.436
 I will hide this, 

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:20.814
 Hide it under the other fishtails. 

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:23.625
 Pull the fishtail around the head. 

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:28.345
 Need a small hair clip at some point 

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:30.859
 Secure the fishtail in place. 

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.877
 In this way, Tibetan, Tibetan, and Tibetan. 

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.973
 Part is on, part is on. 

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:42.760
 The other thing I want to do is 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.663
 I want my hair to be a little more fluffy. 

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:48.902
 So I will be very gentle 

00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:52.398
 Pull a few times on the outer edge, 

00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:57.106
 Let the hair fluffy, 

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.928
 This really increases the fullness and 

00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:01.483
 The effect of the fish tail. 

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:03.446
 After I finish, I will continue 

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:05.801
 Fix some points 

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.500
 To make sure it stays where we want it. 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.069
 Ok, this is done. 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.811
