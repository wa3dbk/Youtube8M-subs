00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 and 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.380
 hi how are we here in code 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.500
 I facilitate our unity tutorial and today 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.060
 let's see how to use tickets from 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.340
 keyboard to move our objects 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.370
 well we'll remember the script we did 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.630
 of movement 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:35.140
 and well basically we're going to create by the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.380
 moment a variable at the object level 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.180
 this variables to call base type 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.720
 float let's call it the delta 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 reuters 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.960
 or high turnover and we're going to put a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.460
 30 flow value 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.840
 now it is instead of putting him here the 30 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.950
 let's put the variable that we're going to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.220
 do 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.980
 and what I want is in our power already 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.390
 not have that function as such but rather 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.960
 let's create a function called 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.470
 it has been called cloud gate just like 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.909
 want 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.299
 Y 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.700
 let's move this instruction we're going 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.870
 to copy and delete and we're going to put it 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 here 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.479
 well now 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 how do we detect keyboard inputs very 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.760
 simple let's put an ife and we're going 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.690
 to put input point 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.690
 what peking 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:47.010
 and kiko point glass for the key q 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 then basically what you want and 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.550
 this is that we're going to clean and see what 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.230
 keys is pressing and the key is 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.590
 one then we will notice 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:06.810
 - High rotation let's copy this 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 block again we're going to write the if 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 if the key is one and we are going to rotate with 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.040
 the positive rotation is to say if the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.430
 entry to the annotation function if the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.410
 key that we are pressing is the one that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.290
 we are going to rotate against the hands 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.390
 of the clock if the key that we are is yes 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.980
 and if not, if the slide key is going to rotate 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.000
 in favor of the red hands 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.160
 so here we put 'rotateq' 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 so that every time the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.319
 update review is going and a good rotation 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.519
 there was no first compilation 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.799
 and well now I'm here pressing that 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.689
 I'm walking 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.210
 and we are seeing as now we 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.860
 we are rotating our cube 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.590
 all right 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.380
 now let's make it move is 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.830
 pretty similar we're going to create a 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.900
 variable that is also flow is called 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.800
 to delta movements or delta in motion 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.210
 and we are going to put a value of 10 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.210
 let's create the function 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.569
 move 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.830
 a movement with which also not 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.830
 let's go mobile 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.810
 and we give it if input point g 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.020
 kick out point w 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.610
 let's go again to call a function of 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.220
 transform that is called translate 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.410
 this function is used to move 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.510
 our transform with respect to a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.690
 vector and the vector that we are going to send 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.910
 will be a vector that already exists that 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:05.610
 flame vector and point 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:08.180
 forward this vector is 001 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.190
 we are going to multiply it by delta 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.160
 movement 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.640
 and we will multiply it by time delta 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.130
 time to remember that there is 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.250
 remember that this delta time point is the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.530
 that allows us to have a movement 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.530
 same in any of our 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.860
 any any computer or 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.460
 device that is used here nothing more 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.460
 lack 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.230
 and we will also review 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.500
 move 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.160
 Inside the hotel 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.160
 good 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.570
 so I'm pressing keyboard w 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.170
 the key and I'm using the w 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.510
 well we left the camera but 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.240
 in the scene we can see how still 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.560
 I keep moving 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.650
 all right 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.860
 and now let's do this and well what 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.090
 only thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.090
 copy this block 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:30.110
 I'm going to write the copy 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.110
 copied else 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.860
 let's put instead of the w the s 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.479
 then the a 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.580
 then the one of good here instead of forward 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.340
 which is forward let's go back that 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:51.819
 is backward the base of the left or 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.819
 be left and the base to the right or 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.240
 Y 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.840
 we have to 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:08.340
 already to have in the four points 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.090
 and besides, that is not our cube 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.090
 we can control it 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.530
 and good you are a strip although basic because 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.870
 a little more complete allows us 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.970
 control our object 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.350
 but well we're still not barely 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.660
 we are moving we have not seen 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.610
 We have not seen more physics 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.180
 components so in the next 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.760
 chapter let's start with a bit of 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.250
 physical and see how the different 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.660
 components work together the 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.240
 remember gustavo leave your 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.890
 comments here below or on twitter and 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.040
 See you the next chapter 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.040
 bye
