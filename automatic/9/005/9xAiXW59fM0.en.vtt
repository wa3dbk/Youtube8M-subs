 there will be some small news we are going to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.000
 continue with a lot of domus on Fridays 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.390
 remember that the time side and for me 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.250
 Facebook page and Saturdays go to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.690
 be of pixel we will get normally 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 had not done in this week that happened 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.079
 because they had them had a lot of work and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.610
 for that reason but we're not going to do the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 review these and I want to eliminate the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.910
 games we are going to follow those that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 want to play more than anything but do the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 revision to this textures package 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.970
 let's go into our texture map 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.909
 and well this package reminded me I do not know 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.619
 why is it a little more there so 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 say it because it does not change you if we say 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.509
 that something that will change you a lot 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 way not practically the only thing that makes 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.900
 is to make chili topics 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.430
 of color to the wood so here they are 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.680
 the roads look different I do not know why 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.510
 it's just a little stick as well as 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.420
 iron there go the pinches pigs follow 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.310
 there are not lowered or is the sheep the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.510
 good chicken what birds and chickens already 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.160
 they know that by chance they do not change 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.080
 texture I do not know why if the 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.400
 creators or the porters have already 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 note that the route on which the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.060
 pack of the sheep and the chicken is not the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.229
 same as making a world in 0.8 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.479
 1 point where it should be on the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.000
 what is the name of the pig yes and we are missing 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.690
 over here because a cow a cow there 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.070
 the cow is on the bench saying no 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.160
 he said very well but they say no 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.450
 and well tell me and by and 6 so no 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.020
 we are going to have problems as you see it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.020
 little sexier 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.729
 this is the oven that looks like a stove 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.860
 he is a cutter what is the chest the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.770
 cake or for man call the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.760
 the pumpkins carry the cart in the main 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.849
 here 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.670
 the spiders and then here we are going to enter 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.390
 see the zombies the zombies here 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.909
 are the zombies that looks all medium 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.170
 as well as with a madrazo in the forehead 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.459
 here are the clippers that look very 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.049
 very well I also liked that 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.060
 color of berta and the clips are left 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.799
 very very well here are the skeletons 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 that are also green I do not know why 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.120
 like this boeing or the bow do not bring it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.129
 I think that is a book but it is that if 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.049
 is cut and 6 with the one that does not have no 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.769
 has error but good is invisible its 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.209
 arch and here are the men are visser 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.459
 2 that the only thing that is different is the 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.549
 sword of 9 to see if it grabs me well 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.889
 the arch to not forgive is that the arch does not 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.389
 it's a bow the hole in the arch are like 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.340
 a gun type and look has an effect 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.989
 from a half point of a thousand between change the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.730
 little dot of yellow and red when 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.040
 it's already the maximum it's not like a gun 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.900
 hey he looks half is bastard he was in 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.970
 third person comes I bring my gun if 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 ok click ok let's load now 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.900
 shoot 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.050
 it's something I do not understand I have not seen 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.480
 until now the compass all in hand is 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.350
 see well and let's put our little sword 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.750
 our appearance 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.510
 and finally, the other blocks and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.370
 Neder know that the rector and the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.350
 sponge very few change that texture not 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.240
 I know why this I said long ago 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.570
 that was the ocs and diana sorry was not 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.250
 help him to this is the the network this is 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.980
 that I told obsidian in the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.420
 previous video all the wool of 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.180
 colors here are the materials 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.390
 removable that is the blue and gold rock 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.240
 iron diamond cargo and this are the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.610
 normal train tracks not the ones that 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.800
 they have impellers I have not put the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.290
 straw without one in a fucking ball of 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.480
 straw here and in the web in others 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.370
 blocks in terms of quartz and stone the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.520
 wooden blocks and then here is that of 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.500

 this is the clay and this is the gravel if not 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.530
 I remember if they do not agree 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.570
 bricks that I mentioned the little trees 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.490
 and that's how everything is all with 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.110
 graphics to the maximum not like that is how it 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.360
 appreciate a very good package texture 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.549

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.900
 that and well here this is not modified 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.560
