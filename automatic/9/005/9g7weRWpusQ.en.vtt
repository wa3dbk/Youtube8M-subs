00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:11.160
 the galeras in view that another video 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.719
 today see quick news on the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.070
 sea news on blogs 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.870
 a lot of people ask me where to stay 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
 knowing several times I send an email 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.510
 for the creator of the game not his Alex more 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.460
 If you want, you can sign in to the account. 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.519
 twitter the biggest block as you are 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.650
 seeing that I have in his account and that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.439
 it has several interesting things like 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.719
 information started here 1.26 point was 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.969
 played only 84 times while 26 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.960
 points in which 10 million 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.570
 times 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.899
 but the most interesting is when he 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 puts things on the game an example 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.300
 This is the kind of lava he will do. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.820
 when you will be converted with water 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.100
 so you'll get this green here more 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.910
 or less yellow and that orange that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.770
 the original expected in the other example of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 How's the texture? 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.719
 I do not know if I like it because it has no type 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 the block would prefer it to be straight 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.430
 in my opinion and if you go down 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.470
 there are several things that is interesting 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.659
 that this guy did he did a construction 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.909
 very large and then took several 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.380
 screenshots had already commented on 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.759
 this is what I wanted to do one thing 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.229
 similar to this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 but the biggest block was giving a lot 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.950
 problem and losing the world but 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 cool 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.509
 so you keep going down here 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.310
 it will have some interesting things 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.250
 like the lemonade I showed you a video 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.579
 before you get the brother takes the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.310
 glass and turns it into bottles and 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.680
 then you go and put the lemonade in 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 here also showed that part of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.170
 load and save the world what goes 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.590
 too much help to share the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.810
 world with you that more than he spoke 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.329
 that he spoke here also of the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.299
 keyboard configuration all that I 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.219
 I'll show you if you send me a 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.189
 message to him probably he should 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.399
 publish here year unfortunately i never 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.340
 I sent nothing that new sounds are corners of the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.530
 game but adding 1 and see if it publishes 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.480
 here too and then I'll show you 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.360
 and here it also shows things from the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 block 2 there will be two years without publishing 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.340
 the largest block 2 as I did several 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.990
 videos was really cool but this guys 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.850
 just a little warning and no more ships 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.220
 an idea of ​​where you might be 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.510
 getting more information about the game 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.739
 online blogs 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.540
 I hope you liked it, I'll go. 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.540
 staying here was worth and until the next
