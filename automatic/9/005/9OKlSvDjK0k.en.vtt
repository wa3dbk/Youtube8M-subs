and<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> water<00:01:16.440> goes<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> boiler

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and when the water goes to the boiler

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
and when the water goes to the boiler
our<00:01:17.430> piston<00:01:17.789> moves<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> fire<00:01:18.930> out

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
our piston moves down and the fire out

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
our piston moves down and the fire out
and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.429> fire<00:01:20.640> comes<00:01:20.910> off<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.119> water

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and then the fire comes off the water

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.389 
and then the fire comes off the water
comes<00:01:21.690> out<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:22.649> weren't<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.009> work<00:01:23.220> on

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
comes out they weren't they work on

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.340 
comes out they weren't they work on
conjunction<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> fluid

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
conjunction and from there the fluid

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.900 
conjunction and from there the fluid
then<00:01:25.530> goes<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.160> steam<00:01:26.460> generator

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
then goes into the steam generator

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.460 
then goes into the steam generator
there's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> bypass<00:01:28.410> on<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.979> bit<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> pressure

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
there's a bypass on that bit of pressure

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.980 
there's a bypass on that bit of pressure
put<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.649> on<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.950> top<00:01:32.160> here<00:01:32.399> is<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.240> bypass<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
put it on the top here is a bypass on

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.540 
put it on the top here is a bypass on
the<00:01:34.080> temperature<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.099> temps<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> the

that's<00:01:37.600> where<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:37.990> runs<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.280> there's<00:01:39.520> a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
that's where it runs and there's a

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.130 
that's where it runs and there's a

all white made by the whites sewing
machine<00:01:55.600> company<00:01:55.900> it's<00:01:56.760> 1905<00:01:59.550> the<00:02:00.550> engine<00:02:00.940> in

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
machine company it's 1905 the engine in

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.880 
machine company it's 1905 the engine in
fact<00:02:01.330> on<00:02:01.510> this<00:02:01.690> one<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.020> nineteen<00:02:02.410> seven

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
fact on this one is nineteen seven

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.130 
fact on this one is nineteen seven
that's<00:02:03.670> because<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.060> simply<00:02:04.360> had<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.810> do<00:02:05.020> it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
that's because I simply had to do it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.770 
that's because I simply had to do it
because<00:02:05.320> they<00:02:05.680> they<00:02:06.400> modified<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> nineteen

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
because they they modified the nineteen

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.570 
because they they modified the nineteen
five<00:02:08.050> engines<00:02:08.500> take<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> higher<00:02:09.190> pressure

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
five engines take the higher pressure

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.600 
five engines take the higher pressure
and<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.390> put<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.630> piston<00:02:11.110> valve<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:12.400> and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and they put a piston valve on it and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.760 
and they put a piston valve on it and
that's<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:13.989> successful<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.620> it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
that's that was so successful that it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.520 
that's that was so successful that it
went<00:02:14.950> into<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.160> production<00:02:15.430> cars<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.239> 1970<00:02:17.050> so

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
went into the production cars of 1970 so

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.800 
went into the production cars of 1970 so
this<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> 19-7<00:02:18.459> engine<00:02:18.820> it's<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.450> twenty

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
the last six or seven years from scratch

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.339 
the last six or seven years from scratch
copying<00:03:48.090> whites<00:03:48.599> tell<00:03:48.930> us<00:03:49.049> in<00:03:49.200> their

parts<00:03:51.629> so<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.349> worked<00:03:52.739> out<00:03:52.980> where<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.609> engine

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
parts so I worked out where the engine

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.309 
parts so I worked out where the engine
would<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.389> everything<00:03:54.659> else<00:03:54.810> would<00:03:54.989> be<00:03:55.019> I

would be and everything else would be I

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.490 
would be and everything else would be I
already<00:03:55.859> had<00:03:56.220> I'd<00:03:56.609> found<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.209> 1970<00:03:58.109> engine
