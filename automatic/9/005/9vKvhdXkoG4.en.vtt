00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.220
 hi guys, how are you with the reason 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.930
 I want to make a series of videos with 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.209
 interest and curiosities in 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.129
 videogames I thought that the best way to 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.440
 start is through a video 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.869
 introductory showing that it is unister 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.789
 ex and giving more information about it 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.919
 so that those who do not handle the 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.919
 subject can understand it and seeing my 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.109
 future videos do not have doubts if not 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.029
 you have no interest in the subject I ask you 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.140
 kindly leave the video and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.140
 continue with your things 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.620
 the ex sisters or their translation into Spanish 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.270
 Easter eggs are messages objects or 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.580
 feature hidden inside 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.550
 different works such as for example 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.290
 in the cinema through his films 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.310
 finding in some of them secrets 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.560
 that for the majority go unnoticed 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.360
 this also happens in music 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.670
 finding in some songs 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.530
 hidden messages of different type 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.049
 even some assuring that they have 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.030
 satanic content other messages have 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.409
 lighter content and they are even 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.990
 funny 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.090
 the programs or softwares are not 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.069
 alien to this kind of messages and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.530
 We can find various secrets in 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.659
 programs that are usually quite serious 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 or totally oblivious to what they can 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.530
 get to hide 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 at first and talking 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.030
 specifically of video games the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.310
 main reason for programmers 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.590
 to hide these ist the ex was the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.210
 leave a kind of digital signature a 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.830
 differentiating stamp as a way of 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.770
 recognition for the work done 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.810
 that unfortunately at that time 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.910
 was duly recognized and that 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.979
 Through this original method they achieved 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.050
 create a trend that is and will be 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.780
 grateful for the gamers more 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.539
 attentive 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.490
 an example of such reasons we can 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.230
 find in the first programmer to 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.240
 who is credited with creating the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 first easter egg in a video game 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.709
 his name is guarin robinet and that in the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.020
 video game that he programmed in the year 1979 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.510
 adventure for the historic atari 2600 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.940
 created a secret room in which 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.100
 hid his name here you can see the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.870
 exact moment when you access the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.500
 secret room and the name appears 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.180
 of the programmer on the screen this guy 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.989
 of facts was strictly 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.760
 prohibited by the company at that time 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.830
 the measures imposed by the large 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.780
 companies was to prohibit the creators 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.269
 get recognition for your work 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.610
 treating them as true anonymous and 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.319
 a pittance compared with the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.250
 million dollars that the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.850
 companies 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.460
 in 1980 after having sold throughout the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.080
 world about 300 thousand copies of the title a 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.180
 15 year old boy discovered 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.310
 accidentally the secret that warren 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.830
 he had jealously guarded during a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.360
 year for fear of being fired after this 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.760
 some journalists of the magazine 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.800
 electronic game reported the story and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.870
 they called easter egg to this mark 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.670
 personal that elevated him to stardom 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.370
 at a time when they were not given 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 credit to programmers 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.760
 Currently the sister ex is not so 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.950
 only oriented to receive a 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.409
 recognition also seek to do 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.450
 reference to other works make jokes 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.549
 internal or that only some connoisseurs 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.980
 in a specific subject they will understand or 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.569
 simply deliver a reward to 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.050
 the players that strive in 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.840
 find something extra in a game 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.180
 many currently confuse the term 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.830
 hysterical with simple references or 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.810
 curiosities that we can get to 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.730
 find in a video game and not the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.950
 I blame because the line that there may be 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.720
 between both concepts is very thin and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.500
 it is not surprising that he falls 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.030
 mistakes when trying to catalog the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.310
 also the ex ex sisters is their 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.530
 difficulty finding them some 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.690
 are almost to the naked eye or in some 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.330
 part of easy access while in 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.299
 others are in almost inaccessible places 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.560
 or only accessible through hacks 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.870
 some go further and to be able 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.210
 access them you have to do it together 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.620
 with other people because they are impossible 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.620
 to do individually 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.590
 well guys I think that's all for 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.600
 now I hope to be able to make the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.910
 first chapter of easter ex in the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.130
 videogames greetings to all and thanks 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.130
 for watching the video until next time
