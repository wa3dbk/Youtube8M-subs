I<00:03:14.380> mean<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.430> guess<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.700> could<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.000> could

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
I mean I guess you could you could

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.850 
I mean I guess you could you could
presume<00:03:16.570> they're<00:03:16.810> doing<00:03:17.350> something<00:03:17.560> at<00:03:17.710> all

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.940 

yeah<00:03:31.569> in<00:03:31.719> terms<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:32.019> difficulty<00:03:32.469> to<00:03:32.680> sort<00:03:32.890> of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
yeah in terms of difficulty to sort of

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.729 
yeah in terms of difficulty to sort of
average<00:03:33.719> well<00:03:34.719> the<00:03:34.840> second<00:03:35.170> part<00:03:35.379> of<00:03:35.620> this

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
average well the second part of this

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.569 
average well the second part of this
level<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.579> be<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.700> bit<00:03:36.819> tricky<00:03:36.969> look<00:03:37.510> oh<00:03:37.840> oh

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
level can be a bit tricky look oh oh

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.949 
level can be a bit tricky look oh oh
you'll<00:03:39.579> know<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:39.939> mean<00:03:40.180> when<00:03:40.599> we<00:03:40.719> get<00:03:40.840> to
