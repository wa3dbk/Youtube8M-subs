00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.760
 beautiful here we are again is 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.269
 ancestral I bring you a video that comes 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.980
 being from the basic series is for 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.860
 that they know how to apply correctly 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.890
 What is the eyelash tab? 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.570
 run is that it is usually used 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.220
 for when is it going to be a year for a 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.170
 wedding for any makeup like that 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.450
 special event 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.580
 or also for the newspaper for the newspaper 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.010
 sorry because I also sometimes like that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.930
 any normal day I wear them but 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.840
 of course not so dramatic and a little bit more 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.640
 Natural I hope they serve much the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.890
 video that is very helpful for 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.950
 your 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 and if they have any suggestions or want 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.540
 see something special already you know I can 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.030
 leave your comments here below so 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.860
 he did not answer us the same day but in the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.190
 resource of the week if I try as well as 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.410
 of being aware of what they are 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.850
 your doubts comments or whatever 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.409
 I hope you like it and I'll leave you here with 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.409
 the video is worth 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.500
 ok girls let's start with what that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.710
 application of the tab the first thing that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.290
 let's do is going to be take our 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.580
 tab and remove it from what is the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:28.210
 packaging I'm using this mac 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.880
 is number 3 a way we're going to 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.330
 detach the tab of our packaging 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.220
 so that it does not lose the form is going to be 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.380
 pulling it down towards the center 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.840
 now let's start pulling to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.360
 remove it without losing the form 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.210
 because otherwise if the poplars 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.840
 a single one is not going to stay like all 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 the straight piece the tab 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.979
 I'm going to take my tab and the first thing that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.649
 I'm going to do is going to be measuring it in my eye 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.899
 I'm going to take a small mirror because it 's 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.899
 the easiest way for us to apply 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.750
 our tab we are going to grab the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.209
 mirror and let's look down and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.730
 let's put the tab to see if 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.049
 is of the size of my eye or if 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.049
 I need to cut a little 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.080
 this is perfect for me the following 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.740
 what I'm going to do is to grab the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.090
 eyelash 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.090
 from the corners 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.019
 so from the corners that black spot is 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.830
 shadow ok I 'll think that I bring the 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.730
 hands all dirty and I'm going to make you 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:50.069
 well so that I get a little bit the shape 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.069
 to make it more curved 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.450
 then let's grab what is 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.960
 our glue to my training that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.720
 the best I can do is this one of the brand 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.930
 duo as I'm putting it assuming the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.959
 reverse 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.230
 Well , about seven dollars 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.799
 I think we're going to take our tab 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.670
 here on the tips and I'm going to apply the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.670
 glue 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.070
 and I will continue to give a little bit of shape 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.750
 let's wait a few seconds to be 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.650
 Dry the glue a little bit so it is 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.150
 this 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.600
 because if at that time I grab the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.090
 tab and I tried to apply it as the 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.430
 glue is very wet the only thing that 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.470
 I'm going to be going to be a cochin in my 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.420
 eye and because I will be dancing the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.760
 glue to go here 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.380
 then I will wait a few seconds to 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.540
 that the glue dries for the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.640
 moment that the application is firm 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.300
 and then we will accommodate the two 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.300
 extremes 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.310
 there is the wall lamp in the center 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.310
 as an extreme 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.820
 and I arrange it in the way that is more 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.680
 stuck to our 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.760
 towards the growth of our 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.760
 natural eyelashes 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:45.060
 he already only tried to sign 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.250
 to ensure that it stays that way 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.640
 completely attached to my tab 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.640
 natural 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.930
 here the girls trick what I give them 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.419
 I wanted to show is how to apply the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.449
 tab because usually all 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.490
 we want to go to the mirror and grab the 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.169
 tab and just try to put it 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.870
 then what is happening we have left 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.330
 very up and serve a space 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.580
 between what is the false eyelash and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.360
 our natural eyelash but here the 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.009
 trick is that it is the same many already have 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.790
 done I the truth has not looked that 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.820
 some other person 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.980
 when he does he does it like this this is something 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.470
 that worked perfectly for me and is 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.360
 something that I wanted to share because if 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.640
 have sent me several messages of which 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.400
 is the correct way to apply the 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.350
 tab of thread tab running and then 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.849
 also the staff this is the way that 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.279
 easier it makes me 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.249
 we give other seconds to dry by 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:00.099
 complete the tab 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.749
 here I already have it the tab is 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.349
 completely dry we are going to give 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:07.569
 account because the glue looks white 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.779
 here but when it dries it becomes 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.779
 transparent 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:17.210
 then the only thing I'm going to do 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.790
 in this case I bring what is 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.670
 shadow or swallow black eyeliner then 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.670
 I'm going to spend some black eyeliner 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.670
 above 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.500
 since we apply our eyeliner or the 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.690
 black shadow or whatever it is that we 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.910
 we have applied our makeup 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.979
 let's go mascara but only in 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.610
 our natural eyelashes not in the 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.610
 false eyelashes 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:01.389
 beautiful and it's ok and is 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.189
 completely the tab well attached me 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.409
 I assure you that they will not be moved 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:08.020
 in the whole night if they do it with 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:10.240
 patience do not want that in a matter of 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.029
 30 seconds a power after nightmare 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.620
 magically it fits you super well there 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.360
 have patience the first times 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.969
 remember that they will not be like that 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.479
 like that perfect but I hope there is 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:25.509
