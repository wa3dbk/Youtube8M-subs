00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.700
 hi to all and all his states 78 kilos why would not I be for a 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.850
 little video trick 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.270
 which project 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.530
 no mistake 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.560
 in the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.840
 to them second part here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.930
 it took place in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.710
 on the obvious version 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.870
 e caramba yes all that makes it to just cherry boxing has three 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.700
 these challenges 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.990
 a solo campaign cell is pretty nice story 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.120
 it's a little 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.670
 red flows 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.680
 but she is blonde 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.560
 to ours still quite advanced in the game you have to be a metro city 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.510
 so to give you 9 0% 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.110
 we come from the man 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.390
 metro city 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.790
 the subject for a few years out of 1 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.430
 so we went up the stairs on the left 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.060
 in front of the mayor's office 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 we see that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.700
 All rights 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 and what meaning there is this door there 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.430
 so this is a small room wink 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.380
 one of the old winter software games you have 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 surely for some to recognize it quickly 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 and to conclude cepal at this salon which hosts the tsahal 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 saturday in paris for wolf bought a 3ds 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.280
 if at the beginning of the game so I go to the country but even if I have the opportunity I play the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.180
 role 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.789
 Swiss 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789
 these ads have no substance is simple but 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.399
 the role in the saga of the authors 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.399
 so here is an effort to enjoy it here 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.869
 good media benchmark 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.729
 he wore only marc cherry 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.889
 a prophet is here 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.219
 so we have little pale reflection 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.579
 I think we'll have to do 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.669
 we are never exposed 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.669
 bÃ©thune laverrou 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.779
 I am at the bottom of touch 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.779
 I changed my homeland to hear that 130 hectares of FPI 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.779
 we must learn 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:00.399
 I often take it is always useful in a good agreement it's this door 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.629
 free kick when returning from comics 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.329
 to be able to read it you see millions 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.399
 It's finish 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.399
 continue 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.249
 why do not you want 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.249
 we continue we have no choice 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.009
 arrived tears 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.009
 we go by the way 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.219
 we can go through the right it's a little more the world sees it's a little 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.199
 con tour 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.979
 we hope it lasts 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.579
 this way 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.529
 and when we find ourselves in an office we keep others from others 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.399
 mastodons 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.769
 percent in a year 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.649
 very restricted space 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.689
 so we come here we have to start with this decision 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.799
 michael jackson us then something happened 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.750
 on what it is not done but not directly 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.050
 not the one in the office the device happened something and when 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:11.809
 then we do the whole row of cp solar 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.189
 on all the boards then there we do not see very well 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.039
 here 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.199
 cristie kerr the p the bowl in front of frejus this link listen 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.779

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.860
 the antibois 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.860
 I do not know if you heard 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.719
 advance 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.800
 rubbing on the door and marketing 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 you enjoy the retreats 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.159
 finally we can continue the same 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.159
 yet we sell early August 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.110
 notice 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.189
 god we can open the door now 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.309
 what do you think is what 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.309
 some have already retained some you already know 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.930
 so in order to avoid the most affected cancer risk 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.979
 why is not it 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.439
 Lets' go 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.439
 the parade in a small room 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.560
 with b &amp; you very impressive special effects 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.789
 sanou swiss 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.889
 but a bit of relief 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.029
 what the old games is the double 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.029
 from the opinion of the softwares before 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.900
 for kicks it was really huge but now it's true that 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.080
 when robert ford 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.080
 in the end we did not really get really tired 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.669
 it really follows our movement 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.669
 why making them pressure whatever it is 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.860
 only something good 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.379
 Here is the menu 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.499
 here is a little wink 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.499
 scary the tournament 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.310

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.849
 look rather this famous be part 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.559

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.089
 with the scope 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.979
 but there 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.979
 the little figurine 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.110
 n that you are unique 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.469

 lg promotional work 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.409
 10 dt 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:48.869
 here 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.029
 she can receive 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.029
 even 100% 130 $ 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.389
 it's really a very 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.149
 at the time it was still 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.149
 it's impressive 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.069
 small 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.039
 he goes back to another world 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.449
 we can go back to remember 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:14.110
 his front door 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.559

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:20.789

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.240
