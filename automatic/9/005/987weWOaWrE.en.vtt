to do too much and you know it took
Connick<00:00:13.139> counterproductive<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.889> tonight

Connick counterproductive but tonight

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.150 
Connick counterproductive but tonight
when<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.420> talked<00:00:15.599> about<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.839> four<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.070> last

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
when we talked about a four in the last

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.920 
when we talked about a four in the last
few<00:00:17.340> days<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:18.300> back<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> having<00:00:18.630> fun<00:00:18.779> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
few days just get back to having fun and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840 
few days just get back to having fun and
relax<00:00:19.320> out<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.699> did<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
relax out there and I think we did a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.750 
relax out there and I think we did a
good<00:00:20.970> job<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.990> look<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
good job of that and I look like the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.859 
good job of that and I look like the
first<00:00:23.939> period<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.390> another<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> those

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
first period was another one of those

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.170 
first period was another one of those
nights<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.470> unlike<00:00:26.460> before<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.060> why

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
nights but we unlike before we know why

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.189 
nights but we unlike before we know why
think<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:27.599> stuck<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.990> tonight

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
think we really stuck with it tonight

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070 
think we really stuck with it tonight
and<00:00:28.470> kept<00:00:29.189> battling<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.750> shanny

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and kept battling and you know shanny

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
and kept battling and you know shanny
kind<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> gave<00:00:31.619> us<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> huge<00:00:31.859> huge<00:00:32.250> lift<00:00:32.550> there

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
kind of gave us a huge huge lift there

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
kind of gave us a huge huge lift there
you<00:00:33.390> mentioned<00:00:33.719> she<00:00:33.840> ended<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> left<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you mentioned she ended with the left is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.850 
you mentioned she ended with the left is
that<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:35.360> game-changer<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.590> absolutely<00:00:37.590> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that a game-changer there absolutely you

that a game-changer there absolutely you
know<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.879> power<00:00:39.059> plays<00:00:39.390> leading<00:00:40.350> up

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
know I think the power plays leading up

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.510 
know I think the power plays leading up
to<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.910> we're<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.300> were<00:00:42.480> creating<00:00:42.870> some
