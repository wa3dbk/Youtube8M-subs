00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
to look like going like this it's a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.680 
to look like going like this it's a
little<00:02:37.020> bit<00:02:37.140> bunchy<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.150> open

let's turn it over okay that's better

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.790 
let's turn it over okay that's better
you're<00:02:58.360> not<00:02:58.540> going<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.110> get<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> hundred

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
you're not going to get it a hundred

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.600 
you're not going to get it a hundred
percent<00:02:59.920> perfectly<00:03:00.910> flat<00:03:01.420> here<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.370> I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
percent perfectly flat here so that I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.460 
percent perfectly flat here so that I
think<00:03:03.850> that'll<00:03:04.120> be<00:03:04.150> fine<00:03:04.569> if<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.810> press<00:03:05.260> it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
think that'll be fine if we press it

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.110 
think that'll be fine if we press it
that'll<00:03:05.770> look<00:03:05.890> fine<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.640> that's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.940> nice

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
that'll look fine and that's a nice

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.750 
that'll look fine and that's a nice
straight<00:03:07.569> seam<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.620> then<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.340> want<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.610> do

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
straight seam and then you want to do

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.310 
straight seam and then you want to do
the<00:03:09.880> same<00:03:10.150> thing<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.590> back<00:03:11.860> section<00:03:13.320> okay

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
the same thing for the back section okay

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.090 
the same thing for the back section okay
this<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.730> probably<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:17.230> best<00:03:17.470> way<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.770> pin

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
this is probably the best way to pin

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.949 
this is probably the best way to pin
this<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:19.200> lay<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.380> flat<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:21.370> way<00:03:22.590> and

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
this is to lay it flat this way and

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.759 
this is to lay it flat this way and
following<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.140> seam<00:03:26.470> line<00:03:26.770> down<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:29.530> put

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
following the seam line down just put

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.479 
following the seam line down just put
your<00:03:30.010> pins<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:32.350> continuous<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
your pins in a continuous on you have a

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.160 
your pins in a continuous on you have a
seam<00:03:33.790> line<00:03:34.000> right<00:03:34.239> here<00:03:34.510> we'll<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:34.720> continue

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
seam line right here we'll just continue

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:48.170 
seam line right here we'll just continue
down

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.330 

okay<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.420> before<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.290> sew<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.860> want<00:03:51.069> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
okay and before you sew it you want to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.040 
okay and before you sew it you want to
turn<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.450> again<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.310> make<00:03:54.310> sure<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:55.390> you

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
turn it again and make sure that you

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.309 
turn it again and make sure that you
like<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:57.160> way<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.550> pinned<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.319> because

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
like the way it's pinned and because

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.740 
like the way it's pinned and because
that<00:03:59.500> will<00:03:59.739> be<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.040> way<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.580> will<00:04:00.910> be<00:04:01.060> sewed

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
that will be the way it will be sewed

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.850 
that will be the way it will be sewed
so<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.860> just<00:04:03.700> check<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.209> out<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.650> then

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
so you can just check it out and then

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.729 
so you can just check it out and then
repin<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.670> if<00:04:06.790> you're<00:04:06.940> not<00:04:06.970> happy<00:04:07.450> with<00:04:07.840> your

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
repin it if you're not happy with your

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.280 
repin it if you're not happy with your
pinning<00:04:09.190> job<00:04:09.569> but<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.660> should<00:04:10.900> be<00:04:11.050> like<00:04:11.260> that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
pinning job but it should be like that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.330 
pinning job but it should be like that
pretty<00:04:12.010> pretty<00:04:12.940> flat<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:14.190> you're<00:04:15.190> always

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
pretty pretty flat and you're always

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.509 
pretty pretty flat and you're always
going<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.640> have<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.940> little<00:04:16.480> bit<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:18.340> know<00:04:18.370> a

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
going to have a little bit of you know a

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.620 
going to have a little bit of you know a
pinch<00:04:18.970> or<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.239> bulk<00:04:19.510> there<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:20.049> that's<00:04:20.200> fine
