00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
a B that makes it be that's just an e as

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:55.390 
a B that makes it be that's just an e as
in<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.580> bar<00:01:41.090> chord<00:01:41.390> whoa

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.230 

you<00:02:00.430> play<00:02:01.430> them<00:02:01.490> in<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.700> wrong<00:02:01.790> place<00:02:02.060> it

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
you play them in the wrong place it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.430 
you play them in the wrong place it
sounds<00:02:02.360> crap<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:02.990> what<00:02:03.110> I'm<00:02:03.200> trying<00:02:03.320> to

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
sounds crap that's what I'm trying to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:38.330 
sounds crap that's what I'm trying to
show<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.850> so

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.960 

where

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.729 

so<00:02:49.970> that's<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.269> basic<00:02:50.720> model<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.560> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
so that's the basic model of it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.710 
so that's the basic model of it
sometimes<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.640> think<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.970> last<00:02:53.120> time<00:02:53.269> he<00:02:53.540> does

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
sometimes I think the last time he does

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.619 
sometimes I think the last time he does
the<00:02:53.870> chorus<00:02:54.459> he<00:02:55.459> goes<00:02:55.640> through<00:02:55.879> it<00:02:56.000> twice<00:02:56.120> and

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
the chorus he goes through it twice and

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.110 
the chorus he goes through it twice and
then<00:02:57.200> there's<00:02:57.440> an<00:02:57.620> end<00:02:57.980> bit<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.790> before<00:02:59.090> I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
then there's an end bit but before I

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.360 
then there's an end bit but before I
show<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> end<00:02:59.900> bit<00:03:00.769> i'm<00:03:01.010> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> show

show you the end bit i'm going to show
you<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.610> middle<00:03:02.510> bit<00:03:02.840> which<00:03:03.500> involves<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.580 

obviously<00:05:20.600> the<00:05:20.750> real<00:05:20.870> version<00:05:21.110> has<00:05:21.350> a<00:05:21.380> lot<00:05:21.560> of

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
obviously the real version has a lot of

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.350 
obviously the real version has a lot of
distortion<00:05:21.920> on<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:24.640> but<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.730> most<00:05:25.880> important

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
distortion on it but the most important

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.580 
distortion on it but the most important
thing<00:05:26.390> about<00:05:26.570> getting<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:26.990> guitar<00:05:27.260> sound

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
thing about getting the guitar sound

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.590 
thing about getting the guitar sound
really<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.310> just<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.730> twang<00:05:29.030> you've<00:05:29.420> got<00:05:29.510> to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
really is just the twang you've got to

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600 
really is just the twang you've got to
get<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.780> twine<00:05:30.050> right<00:05:30.320> once<00:05:31.040> again<00:05:31.130> twine

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
get the twine right once again twine

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.020 
get the twine right once again twine
right<00:05:31.850> you<00:05:32.570> put<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.840> on<00:05:32.900> your<00:05:33.020> bridge<00:05:33.200> pickup

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
right you put it on your bridge pickup

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.610 
right you put it on your bridge pickup
you<00:05:35.030> get<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.300> volume<00:05:35.690> as<00:05:36.020> high<00:05:36.320> as<00:05:36.470> you<00:05:36.590> can

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
you get the volume as high as you can

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.530 
you get the volume as high as you can
without<00:05:37.280> pissing<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.910> neighbors<00:05:38.210> off<00:05:38.330> too

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
without pissing the neighbors off too

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.650 
without pissing the neighbors off too
much<00:05:38.750> on<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.710> guitar<00:05:40.010> you<00:05:40.700> try<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.390> keep<00:05:41.510> the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
much on the guitar you try and keep the

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.190 
much on the guitar you try and keep the
volume<00:05:41.780> on<00:05:42.230> the<00:05:42.350> amplifier<00:05:42.830> down<00:05:43.870> if<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.020> want

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
volume on the amplifier down if you want

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.950 
volume on the amplifier down if you want
to<00:05:45.260> give<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:45.530> bit<00:05:45.650> more<00:05:45.760> twine<00:05:46.760> you<00:05:47.660> can<00:05:47.840> put

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
to give it a bit more twine you can put

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.450 
to give it a bit more twine you can put
the<00:05:48.050> reverb<00:05:48.290> up<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.560> little<00:05:48.800> bit<00:05:48.920> but<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.310> most

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
the reverb up a little bit but the most

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.100 
the reverb up a little bit but the most
important<00:05:49.940> thing<00:05:49.970> is<00:05:50.300> keeping<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.720> toning

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
important thing is keeping the toning
