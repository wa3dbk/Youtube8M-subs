00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.129
 we finally welcome to 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.129
 skate live 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.839
 people now under interview a franc 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.839
 lópez I hope this video hurts 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.040
 eight years ago down my house always 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.290
 There was a boy 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.450
 Cesar Caceres a term that no longer 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.460
 mounts certain security but pri 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.760
 marginal that got me on the wave the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.760
 scheme 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.259
 as he left him cross and drones that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 you're crazy and told him we're going to have dust 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.950
 said that there are sell cheap shares my 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 brother who was with me told me is 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 sure and is that even if it uses the table 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 no month 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.399
 For what form can there be 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.189
 used and that the purchase was born wrong choose 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.780
 or normal that I'm going to use it a lot in 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.590
 I really want to try this and I do not see 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.590
 what should I leave it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.820
 Caesar's book retired I go to his 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 house to compare how is it and I 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.659
 I meet a good person who 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.660
 endorse its legs although flat and rodrigo 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.920
 Arocena ends such that of that first 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 day we did at rates 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.840
 we stayed as good until now 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.760
 we are riding these first years 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040
 it was like that very cool because it was 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.200
 a new world for us not a year 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.840
 if it was that we met erik eric giler 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.730
 I think he was shouting a lot in the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.250
 writer and everyone I wanted to paste 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.020
 and then called kicks and now like that 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.350
 we have formed a team destroy for 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.350
 service 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.640
 Sebastián Vargas influenced them enough 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.610
 that thanks to him we have lost our fear 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.049
 quite when it comes to going to a spot on the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.049
 street not a railing 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.849
 little by little like it takes us more in 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.709
 serious the sport I remember that it was the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.629
 first to have a camera with that 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.430
 we went to sign everywhere to record 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.200
 whatever it is we did as our 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.510
 first video with all the bloggers that 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.650
 we had ronaldinho jorge rivers 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.650
 betray water 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.390
 after recording like two and a half years 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.920
 because it was not my camera and it was the only 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.780
 way they will record me it was eric that 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.970
 He was there for me, just like me 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.940
 for him I managed to get this video was there 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 When she is treated she decided to officiate me and 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.970
 this video was like for strata not that 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.970
