just want to make a quick video on it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.089 
just want to make a quick video on it
one<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> cool<00:00:25.350> things<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.859> watch

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
one of the cool things about this watch

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.259 
one of the cool things about this watch
is<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> bezel<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> reason<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.060> say

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
is the bezel and and the reason I say

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.380 
is the bezel and and the reason I say
that<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:31.700> Seco<00:00:32.700> has<00:00:32.880> designed<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that is because Seco has designed this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.370 
that is because Seco has designed this
sucker<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.020> work<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
sucker to work just like it should and I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.420 
sucker to work just like it should and I
know<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> bland<00:00:37.920> statement<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
know that's a bland statement what I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.600 
know that's a bland statement what I
mean<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.730> say<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.530> perfect<00:00:41.190> just

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
mean to say is it's it's perfect just

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.770 
mean to say is it's it's perfect just
the<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.180> grip<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> they've

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the way it is the the grip that they've

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.279 
the way it is the the grip that they've
created<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.600> they're<00:00:48.809> Double

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
created that you see they're Double

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
created that you see they're Double
Diamond<00:00:49.520> I'm<00:00:50.520> calling<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:52.399> hooks<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
Diamond I'm calling it it hooks on to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.380 
Diamond I'm calling it it hooks on to
your<00:00:54.449> fingers<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.030> grasp<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
your fingers as you as you grasp it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.260 
your fingers as you as you grasp it
perfectly<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.309> it's<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> need

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
perfectly and it's there when you need

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.570 
perfectly and it's there when you need
it<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.410> won't<00:01:03.229> kind<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:05.150> turn<00:01:06.150> back

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
it and it won't kind of just turn back

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
it and it won't kind of just turn back
inadvertently<00:01:08.580> by<00:01:09.119> accident<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
inadvertently by accident like some of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.649 
inadvertently by accident like some of
the<00:01:10.650> other<00:01:10.860> bezels<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.430> mean<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.700> 120<00:01:12.360> click

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the other bezels I mean it's 120 click

the other bezels I mean it's 120 click
but<00:01:13.220> I'll<00:01:14.220> demo<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> real<00:01:15.240> quick<00:01:15.450> I'll<00:01:15.600> take<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but I'll demo it real quick I'll take it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.950 
but I'll demo it real quick I'll take it
off<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.560> show<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.490> how<00:01:18.180> efficient<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
off and show how how efficient the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:35.469 
off and show how how efficient the
design<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.480
