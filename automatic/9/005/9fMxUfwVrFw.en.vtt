00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.250
 today it is with me that you in the summer 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.660
 ie do not have the so loved the 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.360
 are straw and deceased 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.800
 I will be there to improve 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.470
 a so-called lawn 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.510
 Paving the nose are cluster 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.540
 various components of lawn seeds 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.220
 RasendÃ¼nger and also a substrate that 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.040
 the moisture is longer in the vases 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.559
 I have with this mixture already 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.269
 experience and yes I am convinced 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.370
 are the studies I was doing with 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.829
 build up such a lawn aerator 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.260
 scratching differently than when ventilating 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.239
 I'll get the roller in the second gear 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.309
 not so much lower is not only the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.760
 lawn but also thawed the ground 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.100
 becomes 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.749
 if necessary, I will go by hand with one 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.899
 Scarifying the scarifier is done 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.909
 the floor and larsen with such a roller 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.680
 to which such steel nails attached 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.850
 are 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 Let's start talking 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.470
 work 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 these areas are summer yet bad 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 met 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 I will start this floor now 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.780
 to clean up with the machine 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.620
 I think you can see clearly there 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.150
 just happened 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.620
 the disputed ones raise this up 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.820
 I'll watch it right away 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.650
 cut lawnmowers and here and here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.340
 you can see that the wonderful 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.990
 Soil has also been cultivated now 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 I have the turf at the lowest 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.710
 once mowed down and with the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.410
 van calker works speaks the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.300
 section collected now I imagine 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.230
 the aerator on a lot under it &amp; rough 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:26.450
 in the ground once so right now 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:30.230
 I'll be writing down a lot with the craft 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.060
 I will create the area I will 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.130
 to lighten up the earth again 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.540
 before I go to the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:43.760
 I can do that now 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.890
 plaster on this point still distribute 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.550
 once the master is this area 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.390
 affected 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.280
 and with this lawn west I have me 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.810
 The area I am editing marks 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.730
 want to see are the processing 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.730
 now only reddish brown 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.200
 yes now swiss soil after rain me 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.920
 but probably will simulate against first 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.959
 and 2 3g is not a drain on it and water 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.879
 I'll be back in two weeks 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.040
 here and then I will again 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.860
 show what has become out of here 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.760
 this place here in the entrance area 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.220
 I have the lawn plaster 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.170
 edited here is the turf body 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.760
 burnt 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.650
 behind me stood a few huge firs 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.700
 on the south side they always have one here 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.220
 donated a bit of shade 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.840
 they were felled and so much could 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.049
 I do not even see it this summer 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.640
 was really mega mega dry 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.180
 but here, too, I am sure that he 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.530
 in a short time 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.769
 as I said I will ask both 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.209
 stay tuned and in 14 days I will 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.180
 Let's see then I show you that 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.180
 results-what's so happening here 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.900
 I said after two weeks come 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.990
 I again 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.060
 but already after one week are already 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:21.760
 the first homes rose the weather 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.490
 but also ideal warm and dry 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.490
 and all the beginning of september 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.110
 Now I'll come back next week 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.970
 back here and then that should be 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.670
 overall result a bit better 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.520
 say I go again over to other 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.270
 side so if I am here first away 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 Then you think there was never something 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.010
 but also here it is so if we 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.240
 Closer approach we recognize that the 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.240
 first homes merged 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.160
 but not everything 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.820
 is again really nice and tight 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.980
 next week will see it all 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.060
 different and in two three weeks 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.590
 nothing reminds you of a dry one 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.660
 summer so before it with the video 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.950
 goes again a glance 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.950
 my favorite race 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:52.240
 middle september dryness where i am 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.940
 sown with the lawn 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.460
 plaster wonderful at the places the 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:04.479
 I have not checked that we see 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:07.949
 behind here behind the leaves 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:10.449
 drought continues to leave its traces 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:14.800
 I'll take another look at the other one 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:19.289
 side to the first leaves fall because 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.340
 gradually down that is the place 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.090
 I use the lawn pavement 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.090
 have worked 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.220
 completely okay as I think 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.440
 undoubtedly every lawn seed baptized at 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.150
 optimal conditions and we had 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.520
 okay in the last days it was 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.580
 way too dry and we would have the 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.710
 boy regularly says this and has to 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.050
 that's exactly what the amazing thing is 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.000
 this lawn plaster that you can 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.800
 actually as good as completely except 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.030
 let eight 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.610
 However, you have to say that too 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.370
 already his price for the nine kilo the 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.639
 I bought then I'm good 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.060
 40 euros got rid of just under 45 euros were 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.680
 leave and that's me then one 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.960
 a lot of money if I want you that me 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.780
 for this nine kilo are enough for 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.789
 grumpy 40 square feet if I am 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.340
 considering that I am vavoring the imprint of 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.070
 Wolf somehow buys the 550 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.680
 I am an accomplished square meters 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.910
 bit torn 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.050
 Nevertheless it is a great one 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.190
 product you can do that 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.009
 Recommend 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.680
 and I hope this video contributes to that 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.020
 that diet might make you better 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.060
 decide 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.979
 that was with me by nature for the 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.979
 nature this year new panda
