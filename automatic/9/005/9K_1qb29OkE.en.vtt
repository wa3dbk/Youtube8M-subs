00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
before and that's where the two stills

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
before and that's where the two stills
our<00:02:45.660> production<00:02:46.049> process<00:02:46.170> comes<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.799> we<00:02:47.280> have

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
our production process comes in we have

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.820 
our production process comes in we have
a<00:02:47.430> Bennett<00:02:47.730> still<00:02:47.970> from<00:02:48.120> 1816<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.500> also<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.799> a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
a Bennett still from 1816 we also have a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.229 
a Bennett still from 1816 we also have a
Carter<00:02:50.130> head<00:02:50.280> sill<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:50.910> basically

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
Carter head sill and we basically

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.670 
Carter head sill and we basically
produce<00:02:51.390> two<00:02:51.630> different<00:02:51.750> gins<00:02:52.170> one<00:02:52.440> off<00:02:52.530> each

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
produce two different gins one off each

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.819 
produce two different gins one off each
still<00:02:52.980> then<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.519> blend<00:02:53.700> them<00:02:53.820> together<00:02:54.829> so

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
still then we blend them together so

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:56.870 
still then we blend them together so
that's<00:02:55.950> how<00:02:56.190> we're<00:02:56.400> able<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.760> achieve

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that's how we're able to achieve

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.789 
that's how we're able to achieve
basically<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.690> best<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.049> both<00:02:58.170> worlds<00:02:58.200> when

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
basically the best of both worlds when

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.910 
basically the best of both worlds when
we're<00:02:58.920> producing<00:02:59.280> Hendrix<00:02:59.670> so
