it's it's a great tank I think it's
really<00:02:21.090> well-rounded<00:02:22.790> let's<00:02:23.790> get<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.120> here

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
really well-rounded let's get out here

really well-rounded let's get out here
we<00:02:24.870> run<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.650> an<00:02:25.770> intern<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.130> running<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:26.970> it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
we run it in an intern and running in it

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.860 
we run it in an intern and running in it
in<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> thought<00:02:28.710> about<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:30.090> let's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
take a look at the map here while I head

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
take a look at the map here while I head
out<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.210> thought<00:02:33.990> about<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.500> around

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
out here I thought about going around

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.920 
out here I thought about going around
the<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.700> use<00:02:35.820> my<00:02:35.850> mouse<00:02:36.120> cursor<00:02:36.150> can't<00:02:36.810> I

yeah<00:02:37.350> mouse<00:02:37.590> cursor<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.130> thought<00:02:38.880> about<00:02:38.970> going

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
yeah mouse cursor I thought about going

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.900 
yeah mouse cursor I thought about going
this<00:02:39.360> route<00:02:39.710> but<00:02:40.710> that's<00:02:40.950> kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.430> bit<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.820> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this route but that's kind of a bit of a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.340 
this route but that's kind of a bit of a
meat<00:02:42.120> grinder<00:02:42.240> with<00:02:42.600> not<00:02:42.750> too<00:02:42.960> much<00:02:43.080> room<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
meat grinder with not too much room to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.320 
meat grinder with not too much room to
move<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.100> kind<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.910> turns<00:02:45.090> into<00:02:45.210> a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
move and it's kind of a it turns into a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.510 
move and it's kind of a it turns into a
pika<00:02:45.690> boom<00:02:45.920> p<00:02:46.920> kaboom<00:02:47.220> game<00:02:47.520> here<00:02:47.820> oh<00:02:49.430> look<00:02:50.430> at

in<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> map<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.610> here<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.000> what

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
in the map and it's going here is what

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.910 
in the map and it's going here is what
let<00:03:39.330> me<00:03:39.360> do<00:03:39.660> as<00:03:39.780> well<00:03:39.930> as<00:03:39.960> i<00:03:40.110> could<00:03:40.140> i'm<00:03:40.590> fast

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
let me do as well as i could i'm fast

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.710 
let me do as well as i could i'm fast
enough<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.430> zip<00:03:41.640> back<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.090> forth<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.540> dodge

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
enough to zip back and forth and dodge

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.080 
enough to zip back and forth and dodge
and<00:03:43.140> weave<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> artillery<00:03:44.760> can't

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and weave so that the artillery can't

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.560 
and weave so that the artillery can't
quite<00:03:45.390> get<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.960> good<00:03:46.740> shot<00:03:46.770> in<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.430> me<00:03:47.580> which<00:03:48.480> i

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
quite get a good shot in at me which i

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.060 
quite get a good shot in at me which i
think<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.810> important<00:03:49.290> especially<00:03:49.410> if<00:03:49.800> they

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
think is important especially if they

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.370 
think is important especially if they
know<00:03:50.280> i'm<00:03:50.520> up<00:03:50.670> here<00:03:50.900> it's<00:03:51.900> important<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.350> keep

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
know i'm up here it's important to keep

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.110 
know i'm up here it's important to keep
moving<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.010> artillery<00:03:53.430> doesn't<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.850> an<00:03:53.970> easy

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
moving so artillery doesn't have an easy

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.440 
moving so artillery doesn't have an easy
time<00:03:54.240> getting<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:56.270> missed<00:03:57.270> that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
time getting you I missed that

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.220 
time getting you I missed that
unfortunately<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:00.270> I'm<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.420> no<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.780> could

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
unfortunately and I'm like no I could

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.380 
unfortunately and I'm like no I could
have<00:04:01.320> had<00:04:01.410> me<00:04:01.560> even<00:04:01.740> more<00:04:01.890> kills<00:04:02.220> but<00:04:02.850> that's

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
have had me even more kills but that's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.990 
have had me even more kills but that's
