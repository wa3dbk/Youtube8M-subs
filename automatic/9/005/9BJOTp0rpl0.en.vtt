important thing tonight was get a win um
I<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.430> probably<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:38.969> ugly<00:00:39.329> at

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I know it was probably pretty ugly at

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660 
I know it was probably pretty ugly at
times<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:40.050> look<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> intent<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.309> great

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
times but look the intent was great

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.020 
times but look the intent was great
times<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.899> defended<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.030> spasmodic

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
times we defended a little bit spasmodic

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
times we defended a little bit spasmodic
and<00:00:45.329> probably<00:00:45.809> defended<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.649> bit<00:00:46.770> too

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and probably defended a little bit too

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
and probably defended a little bit too
much<00:00:47.129> emotion<00:00:47.640> there's<00:00:47.850> plenty<00:00:48.120> emotional<00:00:48.539> in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
much emotion there's plenty emotional in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.090 
much emotion there's plenty emotional in
the<00:00:48.719> game<00:00:48.899> from<00:00:49.079> our<00:00:49.230> boys<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> that's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the game from our boys and that's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.319 
the game from our boys and that's
something<00:00:50.340> I've<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> control<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
something I've got to control in the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.840 
something I've got to control in the
future<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:53.160> competitive<00:00:53.309> against

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
future if we can be competitive against

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.380 
future if we can be competitive against
the<00:00:53.940> better<00:00:54.120> sides<00:00:55.940> think<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.059> certainly

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the better sides think I certainly

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.689 
the better sides think I certainly
enjoyed<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> defensive<00:00:58.350> effort<00:00:58.649> off<00:00:58.829> let's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
enjoyed the defensive effort off let's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
enjoyed the defensive effort off let's
go<00:00:59.940> ahead<00:01:00.210> yes<00:01:01.109> yeah<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> good

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
go ahead yes yeah look there was a good

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.460 
go ahead yes yeah look there was a good
collisions<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.080> i<00:01:04.140> said<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
collisions and you know like i said the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
collisions and you know like i said the
intent<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:04.860> terrific<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.610> I'll<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.850> go

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
intent was terrific I think I'll now go

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.140 
intent was terrific I think I'll now go
along<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.600> had<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> defend<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.530> few<00:01:08.150> sets

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
along when we had to defend a few sets

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.940 
along when we had to defend a few sets
of<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.420> goal<00:01:09.630> line<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.170> frantic<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
of our goal line will be frantic and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
of our goal line will be frantic and
we're<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.280> lucky<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.820> conditions<00:01:12.299> were

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
we're probably lucky the conditions were

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
we're probably lucky the conditions were
as<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.350> were<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.189> cut<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.640> cut<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
as they were so we could cut up cut a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
as they were so we could cut up cut a
few<00:01:15.119> things<00:01:15.270> off<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.320> exist<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
few things off because in exist a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
few things off because in exist a
transferor<00:01:17.220> pass<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.119> harder

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
transferor pass was a little bit harder

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
transferor pass was a little bit harder
tonight<00:01:18.540> considering<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> conditions

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
tonight considering the conditions

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.990 
tonight considering the conditions
particularly<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> second<00:01:20.700> half<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
particularly in the second half and I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
particularly in the second half and I
think<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.600> helped<00:01:21.960> us<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.369> empty

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
think that helped us a little bit empty

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.929 
think that helped us a little bit empty
you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> gets<00:01:24.479> some<00:01:24.810> better<00:01:25.049> quality

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
you know but it gets some better quality

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.730 
you know but it gets some better quality
opposition<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.810> even<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.590> they

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
opposition and you know even if all they

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
opposition and you know even if all they
executed<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> fraction<00:01:29.850> better<00:01:30.240> players

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
executed just a fraction better players

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.590 
executed just a fraction better players
i<00:01:30.689> might<00:01:30.869> occur<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.290> few<00:01:31.470> Dom's<00:01:32.600> Petrelli

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960

there<00:04:41.139> are<00:04:41.259> taking<00:04:41.500> apartment<00:04:41.949> you<00:04:42.009> know<00:04:42.039> I

think it's unusual for them to all to be

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.499 
think it's unusual for them to all to be
playing<00:04:45.250> over<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.610> same<00:04:45.849> team<00:04:46.090> but<00:04:46.300> you

your<00:05:02.860> group<00:05:03.039> I<00:05:04.650> know<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.680> suppose<00:05:06.070> it's<00:05:06.340> pretty

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
your group I know I suppose it's pretty

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.980 
your group I know I suppose it's pretty
hard<00:05:06.789> to<00:05:06.909> tell<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.240> better<00:05:07.419> friendly<00:05:07.840> and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
hard to tell the better friendly and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.480 
hard to tell the better friendly and

then what what you can take you out of
that<00:05:09.550> but<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:10.120> think<00:05:10.300> I'll<00:05:10.570> are<00:05:10.750> more<00:05:11.110> than

thought it at the beginning of the game
but<00:05:17.400> England<00:05:18.400> definitely<00:05:19.030> competed<00:05:19.690> right

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
know that in the end the scores probably

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.439 
know that in the end the scores probably
a<00:05:23.320> fair<00:05:23.530> indication<00:05:24.000> between<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.120> difference

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
a fair indication between the difference
