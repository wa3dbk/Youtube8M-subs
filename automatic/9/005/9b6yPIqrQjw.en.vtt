that<00:00:19.730> controller<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.320> today<00:00:22.710> we'll<00:00:22.830> be

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
that controller and today we'll be

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
that controller and today we'll be

sounds<00:00:28.080> first<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> travel<00:00:29.429> all

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
sounds first of all when you travel all

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:42.750 
sounds first of all when you travel all
the<00:00:29.820> tails

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.130 

now<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.239> done<00:00:44.420> Alani<00:00:44.719> to<00:00:44.899> his

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
now that this is done Alani to his

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.709 
now that this is done Alani to his
target<00:00:45.350> these<00:00:45.680> wise<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:48.790> go<00:00:49.790> ahead<00:00:50.090> basically

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
target these wise and go ahead basically

00:00:50.719 --> 00:05:02.900 
target these wise and go ahead basically
them

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:16.850 

check<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> pecs<00:05:03.990> voltage<00:05:15.410> stretch<00:05:16.410> our<00:05:16.680> G

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
check the pecs voltage stretch our G

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:32.680 
check the pecs voltage stretch our G
I'll<00:05:17.550> do<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.840> 48<00:05:19.190> volt<00:05:20.240> 6<00:05:21.240> amp<00:05:21.480> charger<00:05:30.620> spot

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
I'll do this 48 volt 6 amp charger spot

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:44.720 
I'll do this 48 volt 6 amp charger spot
charge<00:05:33.690> on<00:05:42.710> seems<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.890> be<00:05:43.980> fully<00:05:44.310> charged

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
charge on seems to be fully charged

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.560 
charge on seems to be fully charged
let's<00:05:45.000> check<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.450> M<00:05:46.790> get<00:05:47.790> the<00:05:47.880> load<00:05:48.060> resistors

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
let's check the M get the load resistors

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.950 
let's check the M get the load resistors
in<00:05:48.750> here<00:05:49.160> and<00:05:52.850> they<00:05:53.850> are<00:05:53.880> wall<00:05:54.300> so<00:05:54.810> it's

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
in here and they are wall so it's

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.830 
in here and they are wall so it's
shunting<00:05:56.060> which<00:05:57.060> means<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.570> it's<00:05:57.690> just

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
shunting which means that it's just

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
shunting which means that it's just
balancing<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.380> packs<00:05:58.560> out<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:59.460> cells

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
balancing the packs out the cells

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.550 
balancing the packs out the cells
versatile<00:06:01.860> cells<00:06:02.070> and<00:06:03.350> basically<00:06:04.350> it's

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
versatile cells and basically it's

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.850 
versatile cells and basically it's
already<00:06:04.800> charts

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
already charts

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:20.610 
already charts
you

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620
