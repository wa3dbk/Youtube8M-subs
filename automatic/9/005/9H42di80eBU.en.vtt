00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
 let's go for turkey kebabs 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.760
 on your marks a big piece 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.590
 ladies is like stopping a social portrait after the genesis coupe 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.109
 calming debuchy can cut 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.339
 and we will do 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.339
 tapes 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.140
 and in these bands 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.739
 we cut 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.739
 but square 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.609
 right to the mistake 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.290
 that m's friends 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.980
 more than 6 hectares 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 we go on with our peppers 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.970
 our union 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.710
 so it's simple 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.540
 we begin 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.800
 yet raised the middle 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 to have a maximum of seeds at once 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.790
 in bank business we always have this little bit hard and that in addition 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.670
 like that, we are all alone in the Baltic States 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 here we go 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.200
 and with its banks 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.550
 small squares 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.550
 as with the devil 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.210
 because with all that aside 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 after one more then file 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.910
 dan's notes was created 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.350
 our outlets in the version to wash before cutting is perfect 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.070
 and for the same name 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.150
 we go the clichÃ©s 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.430
 good 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.750
 I 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960
 stingy 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.230
 and we will try to do 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.230
 two hidden secret pieces 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.870
 That's crazy 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.870
 here we know him 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.519
 but better to use this week 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.779
 a meeting 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.419
 in two times 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.559
 to keep 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.559
 the pieces will fold well of an oocyte 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.879
 the veil 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.539
 2 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.539
 so now we're going to take a little wooden pick 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.729
 hefford started late the team becomes 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.639
 and after when you do as you want 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.729
 we are often in meat peppers pr 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.229
 They have some 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.229
 to the lion 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.109
 for rooney 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.979
 lang 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.979
 instead of 12 11 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.389
 reversal 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.739
 let's take back to the mayor 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.629
 and will come back 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.979
 There you go 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.699
 a nice skewer of turkey 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.699
 they also have the wind 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.829
 this is the theme recipe 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.129
 it is done 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.129
 so we already hear that yes but I'm alive and then start 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.779
 and there is more and more that just not the same thing 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.419
 with only small pieces of union 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.689
 There you go 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.059
 thanks in pl 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.769
