00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:10.610
 m6 mobile by dj experience hi this is 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.930
 nico it's anthony we're here under the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.190
 sun we are almost on vacation in 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.330
 anyway we are at yesterday so a little at the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.219
 house since we are both 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.900
 from the south and that's rather 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.749
 cool so obviously it's tonight the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.669
 mobile m6 final already experience and 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.650
 so everything is broken here we have 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.210
 half an hour to get ready and me 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.069
 I prepared a little thing that looks to me 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.839
 a lot of fun so I can not wait to get you 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.839
 listen and I feverishness either 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.430
 would like to end up on local sis to the world 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.850
 where you can cut both tools 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.340
 graphics on both you can find 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.109
 a trick certainly with the bet after 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.699
 the hayek boom redo one of the scratch 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:52.179
 as on the first videos of the game of 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.179
 contest i'm going to take the room 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.550
 I understand it there 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.220
 but this little set is fine two 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.440
 and show a little bit what I had 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.980
 prepared at home during these fifteen 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.290
 last days 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.020
 and here we tried to find 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 okay so the 7 is the most 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 pretty possible in a fortnight 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 actually and try to prepare this 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.790
 set relative to the places in relation to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.750
 the time of passage in relation to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.900
 other candidates 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.620
 in ten years seeing what they have already done 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.910
 on other events 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.710
 we know what they will surely played this 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.330
 evening so it's up to us to stand out at 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.040
 we go on something else 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.390
 while actually finding his 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.940
 musical color because anthony has a 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.320
 true a real culture very house with 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.880
 a lot of vocals a lot of vocals 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.800
 a lot of keyboards including something 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.080
 that he really has his universe where I have 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.290
 really want that tonight all the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.670
 world 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.920
 all the people who will be in front 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.690
 of me recognize themselves they are in a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.170
 mind a little bit of relaxation and festive 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.050
 and tonight I tell myself that I'm at a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.070
 stage only eight finals and I 'm 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.420
 say it would be a shame to miss out 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.619
 what for me anthony is a very good DJ 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.060
 it does not surprise me that they are finalized 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.770
 so tonight and I think he has all 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.119
 the chances of winning because he knows 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.300
 understand this concept in terms of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.040
 technique he's here I think he has he 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.630
 at least the basics actually 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400
 fundamental to prepare something 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.300
 owl and in terms of techniques 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.380
 of scratch animation he gets to do 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.490
 all you need to start yourself 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.650
 be well built and consistent 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.420
 so I think it'll do it tonight 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.800
 you see it like that because none of your 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.090
 favorite sounds and I hear you from here 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.090

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.840
 1 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.530
 the performance I made tonight 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.680
 I was rather pleasantly surprised 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.080
 here I had my idea in mind I 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.030
 realize the public has responded well and that 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.390
 for a DJ it's just it's just 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.640
 huge 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.280
 first this return in front of oneself it is 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.860
 a happiness the set went well 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.880
 people were super receptive he was successful 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.590
 to find small pieces for them 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.620
 sing on a taio gold bar 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.960
 cruz or lmfao so the set to bourges 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.900
 worked well so I'm pretty proud 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.370
 from what he did and I do not see you 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.690
 I do not see what is missing 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.250

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.020
 mass to vote for me anti that and me 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.700
