00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
realistically I think in I don't know I

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.560 
realistically I think in I don't know I
played<00:00:28.100> this<00:00:28.190> game<00:00:28.370> like<00:00:28.490> probably<00:00:28.880> 25<00:00:29.270> hours

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
played this game like probably 25 hours

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.049 
played this game like probably 25 hours
already<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:30.110> think<00:00:30.740> I've<00:00:30.890> ran<00:00:31.070> into<00:00:31.340> two<00:00:31.610> people

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
already I think I've ran into two people

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.389 
already I think I've ran into two people
using<00:00:32.450> shotguns<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.110> entire<00:00:33.440> time<00:00:33.829> now

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
using shotguns the entire time now

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.799 
using shotguns the entire time now
there's<00:00:34.579> a<00:00:34.640> reason<00:00:35.059> for<00:00:35.180> this<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:35.600> it's<00:00:35.719> not

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
there's a reason for this and it's not

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.200 
there's a reason for this and it's not
the<00:00:36.230> shotguns<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.860> shotguns<00:00:37.370> are<00:00:37.489> actually

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the shotguns the shotguns are actually

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.060 
the shotguns the shotguns are actually
good<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.600> this<00:00:38.690> game<00:00:38.930> believe<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.230> or<00:00:39.289> not<00:00:39.410> the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
good in this game believe it or not the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.130 
good in this game believe it or not the
problem<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.610> maps<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.210> maps<00:00:41.239> are<00:00:41.690> huge

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
problem is the maps the maps are huge

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.010 
problem is the maps the maps are huge
lots<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.370> long<00:00:43.700> lines<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.150> sites<00:00:44.480> they<00:00:44.870> are

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
lots of long lines of sites they are

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.170 
lots of long lines of sites they are
just<00:00:45.350> not<00:00:45.590> made<00:00:46.010> for<00:00:46.040> shotguns<00:00:46.700> there's<00:00:46.850> very

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
just not made for shotguns there's very

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.780 
just not made for shotguns there's very
few<00:00:47.270> maps<00:00:47.720> or<00:00:48.130> really<00:00:49.130> none<00:00:49.340> other<00:00:49.520> than<00:00:49.670> this

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
few maps or really none other than this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.030 
few maps or really none other than this
one<00:00:50.030> strike<00:00:50.690> zone<00:00:50.899> that<00:00:51.500> are<00:00:51.530> made<00:00:51.860> for

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
one strike zone that are made for

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.979 
one strike zone that are made for
shotguns<00:00:52.489> like<00:00:52.730> say<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.970> sea<00:00:53.360> town<00:00:53.600> or<00:00:53.960> a

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
shotguns like say a sea town or a

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.200 
shotguns like say a sea town or a
bootleg<00:00:54.380> for<00:00:54.620> modern<00:00:54.890> warfare<00:00:55.070> 3<00:00:55.250> where<00:00:56.059> you

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
bootleg for modern warfare 3 where you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.660 
bootleg for modern warfare 3 where you
could<00:00:56.390> traverse<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.930> entire<00:00:56.960> map<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.890> keep

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
could traverse the entire map and keep

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.280 
could traverse the entire map and keep
it<00:00:58.790> close<00:00:58.969> quarters<00:00:59.360> even<00:00:59.690> though<00:00:59.809> there<00:01:00.020> were

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
it close quarters even though there were

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.290 
it close quarters even though there were
long<00:01:00.590> lines<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:01.010> sites<00:01:01.250> on<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.520> sides<00:01:01.760> there's

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
long lines of sites on the sides there's

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.910 
long lines of sites on the sides there's
very<00:01:02.630> few<00:01:02.719> Maps<00:01:03.050> like<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.500> where<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.739> can

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
very few Maps like this where you can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.560 
very few Maps like this where you can
keep<00:01:04.159> things<00:01:04.399> close<00:01:04.610> quarters<00:01:05.030> for<00:01:05.239> most<00:01:05.449> of

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
keep things close quarters for most of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.539 
keep things close quarters for most of
the<00:01:05.689> time<00:01:05.899> which<00:01:06.350> sucks<00:01:06.770> cuz<00:01:06.950> shotguns<00:01:07.369> are

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
the time which sucks cuz shotguns are

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.100 
the time which sucks cuz shotguns are
part<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.969> game<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.299> they're<00:01:08.420> fun<00:01:08.659> so

basically use it only on this one map
strike<00:01:15.859> zone<00:01:16.069> because<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.909> can<00:01:17.090> dominate<00:01:17.569> this

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
strike zone because it can dominate this

this shotgun is semi-automatic and it
has<00:01:24.439> a<00:01:24.469> very<00:01:24.889> thought<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.549> very<00:01:25.909> fast<00:01:26.240> way<00:01:26.539> to

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
has a very thought a very fast way to

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.449 
has a very thought a very fast way to
fire<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.439> can<00:01:27.590> pretty<00:01:27.799> much<00:01:27.889> shoot<00:01:28.219> it<00:01:28.340> as

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
fire you can pretty much shoot it as

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.429 
fire you can pretty much shoot it as
fast<00:01:28.819> as<00:01:28.999> your<00:01:29.119> trigger<00:01:29.359> finger<00:01:29.389> can<00:01:29.779> go<00:01:29.929> which

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
fast as your trigger finger can go which

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.580 
fast as your trigger finger can go which
makes<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.159> very<00:01:31.189> very<00:01:31.969> potent<00:01:32.450> weapon<00:01:32.719> in

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
makes it a very very potent weapon in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.109 
makes it a very very potent weapon in
close<00:01:33.950> quarters<00:01:34.310> now<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.490> range<00:01:34.729> isn't<00:01:34.909> that

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
close quarters now the range isn't that

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.999

extra bullets because you will run

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.410 
extra bullets because you will run
through<00:01:43.069> your<00:01:43.159> clip<00:01:43.399> super<00:01:43.729> fast<00:01:43.969> without<00:01:44.119> it

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
through your clip super fast without it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.839 
through your clip super fast without it
and<00:01:44.509> then<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.289> also<00:01:45.590> use<00:01:46.039> on<00:01:46.279> camera<00:01:46.609> board<00:01:46.759> it's

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
and then I also use on camera board it's

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.370 
and then I also use on camera board it's
called<00:01:46.999> whatever<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.359> attachment<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:47.899> that

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
called whatever the attachment is that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.739 
called whatever the attachment is that
makes<00:01:48.889> you<00:01:48.950> shoot<00:01:49.219> farther<00:01:49.579> I<00:01:49.849> use<00:01:50.389> that<00:01:50.419> one

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
makes you shoot farther I use that one

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:51.909 
makes you shoot farther I use that one
as<00:01:50.779> well<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:50.990> think<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:51.200> adds<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.529> little<00:01:51.679> bit<00:01:51.799> of

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:51.919 
as well I think it adds a little bit of

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:53.559 
as well I think it adds a little bit of
range<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.399> because<00:01:52.549> that<00:01:52.609> range<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.119> really

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
range to it because that range is really

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.629 
range to it because that range is really
short<00:01:53.959> on<00:01:54.169> this<00:01:54.499> shotgun<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.219> make<00:01:55.399> sure<00:01:55.429> you

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:55.639 
short on this shotgun so make sure you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.399 
short on this shotgun so make sure you
have<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:55.999> well<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.389> I<00:01:56.869> use<00:01:57.169> it<00:01:57.200> on

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
have that as well and I use it on

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.139 
have that as well and I use it on
strikezone<00:01:57.679> I've<00:01:58.009> tried<00:01:58.340> another<00:01:58.669> maps<00:01:58.939> it

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
strikezone I've tried another maps it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.739 
strikezone I've tried another maps it
does<00:01:59.419> work<00:01:59.869> on<00:02:00.139> tremor<00:02:01.090> somewhat<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.389> works<00:02:02.599> on

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
does work on tremor somewhat it works on

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.179 
does work on tremor somewhat it works on
warhawk<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.139> little<00:02:03.469> bit<00:02:03.560> if<00:02:03.679> you<00:02:03.770> stay<00:02:03.979> within

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
warhawk a little bit if you stay within

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.370 
warhawk a little bit if you stay within
the<00:02:04.369> buildings<00:02:04.789> but<00:02:05.299> really<00:02:05.719> guys<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.229> this

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the buildings but really guys in this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.710 
the buildings but really guys in this
game<00:02:06.529> right<00:02:07.219> now<00:02:07.249> it<00:02:07.669> only<00:02:07.969> works<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.450> strike

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
game right now it only works a strike

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.270 
game right now it only works a strike
zone<00:02:08.959> there<00:02:09.229> were<00:02:09.500> only<00:02:09.619> works<00:02:09.890> well<00:02:10.250> on

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
zone there were only works well on

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.250 
zone there were only works well on
strike<00:02:10.700> zone<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.150> my<00:02:11.360> opinion<00:02:11.660> that's<00:02:11.930> just<00:02:12.170> my

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
strike zone in my opinion that's just my

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.780 
strike zone in my opinion that's just my
opinion<00:02:12.290> but<00:02:12.770> that's<00:02:13.250> what<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.459> think<00:02:13.700> I've

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
opinion but that's what I think I've

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.730 
opinion but that's what I think I've
tried<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.300> other<00:02:14.330> shotguns<00:02:14.750> guys<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.380> don't

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
tried the other shotguns guys I don't

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.760 
tried the other shotguns guys I don't
think<00:02:15.920> any<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.280> them<00:02:16.430> compared<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.940> this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
think any of them compared to this

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.900 
think any of them compared to this
they're<00:02:18.770> okay<00:02:19.070> they're<00:02:19.100> all<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
they're okay they're all you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.540 
they're okay they're all you
on<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.420> map<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.560> Bulldog<00:02:21.920> by<00:02:22.130> far<00:02:22.460> is

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
on this map but the Bulldog by far is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.250 
on this map but the Bulldog by far is
the<00:02:22.580> best<00:02:22.850> one<00:02:23.000> especially<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:24.020> you're

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
drawing it's pretty awesome so that's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.540 
drawing it's pretty awesome so that's
how<00:02:57.050> I'd<00:02:57.200> recommend<00:02:57.470> using<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:57.860> shotgun<00:02:58.250> all

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
how I'd recommend using the shotgun all

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.100 
how I'd recommend using the shotgun all
the<00:02:58.880> other<00:02:59.000> ones<00:02:59.210> I<00:02:59.360> don't<00:02:59.630> really<00:02:59.780> recommend

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
the other ones I don't really recommend

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.780 
the other ones I don't really recommend
using<00:03:00.440> them<00:03:00.680> they<00:03:00.920> are<00:03:00.950> usable<00:03:01.550> but<00:03:01.640> there's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
using them they are usable but there's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.220 
using them they are usable but there's
just<00:03:01.940> no<00:03:02.090> point<00:03:02.360> other<00:03:02.600> than<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.140> the
