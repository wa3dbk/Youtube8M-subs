00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 everything was fine 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.410
 the outside world hangs by a thread 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.360
 very fine 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.860
 it's only a matter of time before the virus 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.410
 of the flash finish with the rest of 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.420
 we 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.440
 these facilities are designed to 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.430
 keep us safe and sound 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 where they burn it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.800
 they can not stand something, these people are not who 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.500
 he says he's 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.930
 tomÃ¡s what is it that you have never seen us 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.950
 we escape 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.900
 is cruel and all this is part of his plan 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.160
 I really only have one question 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.160
 what side are you on 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.050
 labyrinth is one thing but not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.379
 would survive if one day and was in the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.379
 burn 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.100
 google wants something that we carry inside or 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.080
 they can not find them 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.799
 you do not have to come with me but I know 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.799
 that we will achieve it 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.220
 It had been a long time since nobody left the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.220
 burn 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.070
 those who have stayed behind I want 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.070
 finish like them 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.710
 knows me this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.380
 many friends have died so that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.060
 come, have you had 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.060
 we can not meet alone 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.850
 this goes for all that google has 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.470
 shit they will not stop I'll have to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.390
 stop them 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.810
 he does not want to know why everything happened 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.009
 this equal 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 close to knowing the truth 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.710
 you have to wish 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.640
 Y
