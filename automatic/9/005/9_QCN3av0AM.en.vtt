00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
also have another really nice i think

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
also have another really nice i think
that<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.640> might<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> lesser

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that this one might just be a lesser

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.119 
that this one might just be a lesser
could<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.320> no<00:01:04.409> blushing<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:04.979> head

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
could see there's no blushing on my head

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.890 
could see there's no blushing on my head
or<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.369> nearly<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.700> much<00:01:05.880> blessing<00:01:06.330> blushing

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
or not nearly as much blessing blushing

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.890 
or not nearly as much blessing blushing
but<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> ringer<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.150> much

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
but the ringer on this one is a much

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.010 
but the ringer on this one is a much
larger<00:01:10.409> wringer<00:01:10.710> again<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> again<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.869> might

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
larger wringer again so again it might

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.370 
larger wringer again so again it might
just<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> regular<00:01:16.560> lesser<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> ringer

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
just be a regular lesser with the ringer

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
just be a regular lesser with the ringer
next<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.490> another<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
next here this is another one I think is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780 
next here this is another one I think is
a<00:01:24.420> pastel<00:01:24.990> lesser<00:01:25.409> based<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.920> head

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a pastel lesser based off that head

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.970 
a pastel lesser based off that head
blushing<00:01:29.090> no<00:01:30.090> ring<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.540> anything<00:01:30.659> new

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.600 

and<00:01:35.980> then<00:01:36.160> one<00:01:36.430> more<00:01:38.010> again<00:01:39.010> I'm<00:01:39.220> thinking

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
and then one more again I'm thinking

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.640 
and then one more again I'm thinking
passed<00:01:39.910> out<00:01:40.150> lesser<00:01:40.390> because<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.470> head

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
passed out lesser because of the head

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.130 
passed out lesser because of the head
blushing<00:01:42.330> we'll<00:01:43.330> know<00:01:43.420> for<00:01:43.570> sure<00:01:43.630> once<00:01:43.960> they

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
blushing we'll know for sure once they

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:54.500 
blushing we'll know for sure once they
 out<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:50.440> then<00:01:50.770> these<00:01:50.920> last<00:01:51.250> two<00:01:52.890> are

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
 out and then these last two are

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.530 
 out and then these last two are
definitely<00:01:55.510> pastels<00:01:57.060> we'll<00:01:58.060> figure<00:01:58.330> out<00:01:58.420> a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
definitely pastels we'll figure out a

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.350 
definitely pastels we'll figure out a
little<00:01:58.720> bit<00:01:58.840> more<00:01:59.050> again<00:01:59.440> once<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.680> shut<00:01:59.980> out

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
little bit more again once the shut out

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.700 
little bit more again once the shut out
the<00:02:01.360> mother<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.170> clutch<00:02:02.500> was<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
the mother of this clutch was a

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.810 
the mother of this clutch was a
yellow-belly<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:04.750> may<00:02:04.930> have<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.820> pastel

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
yellow-belly so we may have a pastel
