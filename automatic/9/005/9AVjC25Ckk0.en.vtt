 avetrana I don't want to repeat because they won't all be exams 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.049
 we want to do well we want to get up there 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.669
 so every game 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.669
 It is important and difficult 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.329
 even more against this must be the bad match like us though 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.300
 now other old badoo players have recovered 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.789
 you do well and bad weather 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.249
 is a team with 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.500
 technical rate comment. udinese players are very important 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.100
 they are petidina many teams europe europe for which 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.970
 will be a match 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.490
 l binding 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.240
 tickets is fascinating 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.470
 cellulite 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.020
 romantic dinner in your head always you do not me a mother is one is because they make gods 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.330
 compare but do not evaluate features of each individual 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.580
 player 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.820
 for which 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.730
 it is nice tuttonapoi Tuesdays difficult to implement this does not mean that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.260
 maybe we hope mail 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.300
 coach but should not 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.080
 rigor to put under this empower the front but means that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.240
 we are losing 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.950
 sursum animals cuisine maremmana mathematics but I believe it depends on how 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.510
 I see the player from how I see the way to stay where we are trying to from 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.729
 create problems for the special team for so many things 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.600
 and then I go down 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.610
 but I don't think that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.690
 having played Saturday he did so many 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.440
 so much when a national team player 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.450
 it's not that much 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.650
 this I told daniele stay here 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.430
 and luckily after a month of not training, you don't always find at least 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 you will have 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.230
 a week to train 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.010
 I understand the players 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 when when the national team calls the right go 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.500
 just make yourself available 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.479
 of course it is not we are paying the consequences where they are too heavy 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.640
 well it came out I think just because truthful luck from problems to the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.939
 calf and was not available 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.069
 girl did well also gave answers 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.859
 and it seems right 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.010
 you have given the continuity to express what is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.409
 that he was fielding 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.259
 in the last 5 years he has been a pure center forward 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.520
 inter martina melani seemed obsessed 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.730
 playing against rome I never tried Amalfi tourism - which comes 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.290
 even the ability to learn bolzano does not present arealive 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.950
 state enters the penalty area always comes after trailer as well as 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.759
 when 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.289
 looking for the doors, they were good players of the Juventus team 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.149
 but francesco to this type of game of the year interpreted very well 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:54.839
 changing both shift now reference point now another just for not 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.930
 pay attention and point of reference to the defense of juventus where 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.649
 there were two very great players 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.919
 what I asked the team but I have more cynical more practical today 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.959
 also complimented because they did a great game 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.779
 we played 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.809
 in the opponent's half of the field 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.829
 so I was very happy of course that we need to be more cynical more 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.899
 determined because those are starting from vinci
