films<00:04:10.820> when<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:11.850> look<00:04:12.360> at<00:04:12.630> those<00:04:13.290> installations

films when I look at those installations

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.950 
films when I look at those installations
it<00:04:14.370> seems<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.730> me<00:04:14.820> firstly<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.600> images

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
it seems to me firstly that the images

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.510 
it seems to me firstly that the images
of<00:04:16.080> war<00:04:16.170> seem<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.410> be<00:04:16.470> taken<00:04:16.709> from<00:04:16.770> war<00:04:17.040> films

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.870 
of war seem to be taken from war films
they<00:04:17.730> if<00:04:18.180> they're<00:04:18.360> war<00:04:18.630> toys<00:04:19.020> almost<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.890> when

they if they're war toys almost and when
I<00:04:20.910> see<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.239> Nazi<00:04:21.720> imagery<00:04:21.959> particularly

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
I see the Nazi imagery particularly

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.900 
I see the Nazi imagery particularly
since<00:04:22.680> many<00:04:22.920> of<00:04:23.010> those<00:04:23.130> Nazis<00:04:23.520> are<00:04:23.640> actually

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
since many of those Nazis are actually

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.970 
since many of those Nazis are actually
sort<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.120> zombified<00:04:24.720> Nazis<00:04:25.110> anyway<00:04:25.440> that

sort of zombified Nazis anyway that

sort of zombified Nazis anyway that

what<00:05:48.510> it<00:05:48.630> is<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:49.050> I<00:05:49.320> get<00:05:49.980> out<00:05:50.010> of<00:05:50.280> your<00:05:50.790> work

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
what it is that I get out of your work

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.400

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
you want them to take away from it I

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.390 
you want them to take away from it I
couldn't<00:05:57.960> even<00:05:58.080> answer<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.560> because<00:05:59.100> I

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
couldn't even answer that because I

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.580 
couldn't even answer that because I
don't<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.660> don't<00:06:00.720> know<00:06:00.900> what<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.080> take<00:06:01.380> away<00:06:01.410> from

don't I don't know what I take away from
it<00:06:01.890> half<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.460> time<00:06:02.550> June<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:04.370> think<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:05.460> it<00:06:05.580> in

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
it half the time June I think of it in

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.940 
it half the time June I think of it in
terms<00:06:05.850> of<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:07.070> very<00:06:08.270> marginal<00:06:09.500> small<00:06:10.500> number<00:06:10.890> of

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
terms of a very marginal small number of

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.750 
terms of a very marginal small number of
people<00:06:11.160> that<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:11.550> imagine<00:06:12.590> or<00:06:13.590> I<00:06:13.620> would<00:06:14.520> hope

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
people that I imagine or I would hope

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.350 
people that I imagine or I would hope
would

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
would

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.159 
would
would<00:06:16.199> go<00:06:16.409> away<00:06:16.710> with<00:06:17.280> a<00:06:17.310> certain<00:06:18.000> smug<00:06:18.750> sense

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
would go away with a certain smug sense

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.980 
would go away with a certain smug sense
of<00:06:19.439> robustness<00:06:20.300> but<00:06:21.300> they<00:06:21.389> would<00:06:21.539> feel<00:06:21.720> a<00:06:21.750> bit

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
of robustness but they would feel a bit

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.570 
of robustness but they would feel a bit
kind<00:06:22.169> of<00:06:22.349> you<00:06:22.650> know<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:23.280> there<00:06:23.430> were<00:06:23.520> other

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
kind of you know that there were other

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.550 
kind of you know that there were other
people<00:06:23.909> in<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.330> world<00:06:24.539> that<00:06:24.750> perhaps<00:06:25.229> were

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
people in the world that perhaps were

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.110 
people in the world that perhaps were

about<00:06:36.000> you're<00:06:36.750> working<00:06:37.139> in<00:06:37.409> this<00:06:37.680> kind<00:06:37.860> of<00:06:37.979> a

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
about you're working in this kind of a

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.040 
about you're working in this kind of a
moral<00:06:38.669> thing<00:06:38.879> you<00:06:38.939> know<00:06:39.030> it's<00:06:39.330> a<00:06:39.509> model<00:06:39.960> it's

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
moral thing you know it's a model it's

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.189 
moral thing you know it's a model it's
not<00:06:40.379> redemptive<00:06:40.919> it's<00:06:41.069> not<00:06:41.189> do<00:06:41.370> but<00:06:41.550> there<00:06:41.729> is

not redemptive it's not do but there is

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.659 
not redemptive it's not do but there is
something<00:06:43.199> spiritual<00:06:43.710> and<00:06:43.919> actually

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
something spiritual and actually

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.429 
something spiritual and actually

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719 
say my own lazy easy answer to that is

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.050

things you know what happens if you make

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.600 
things you know what happens if you make
a<00:07:08.759> work<00:07:09.029> of<00:07:09.180> art<00:07:09.300> where<00:07:09.539> you<00:07:09.569> say<00:07:09.919> no<00:07:10.919> it's<00:07:11.400> only

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
a work of art where you say no it's only

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.429 
a work of art where you say no it's only
nasty<00:07:12.300> but<00:07:12.569> what<00:07:12.719> I<00:07:12.750> would<00:07:12.960> say<00:07:13.110> to<00:07:13.169> that<00:07:13.379> is

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:13.439 
nasty but what I would say to that is

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:16.279 
nasty but what I would say to that is
that<00:07:13.800> I<00:07:14.069> think<00:07:14.460> there<00:07:14.699> is<00:07:14.849> for<00:07:15.180> example<00:07:16.110> in

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
that I think there is for example in

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.170 
that I think there is for example in
horror<00:07:16.529> films<00:07:16.740> which<00:07:17.099> have<00:07:17.400> which<00:07:17.639> have<00:07:17.879> no

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180
