00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.410
 Here we can see a helicopter size 4 50 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:13.169
 that has its turn installed and is ready to be lit 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.650
 always arteta without the helicopter let's let you want 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 that our radio 50 fires 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.929
 now the hiking is the helicopter iberia love the initialization of 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.119
 gyroscope 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.560
 in this particular case gyro brush and pulled out a red light 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.259
 and once the gyroscope is correctly in that state 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.950
 change to light still blue 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.250
 in all this process of initialization of turns like 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 the helicopter should not be moved 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.210
 he ended up moving that the light changes from blue red them something moves 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.850
 and that means that the gyroscope 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 percent is on 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.540
 the correct gomera would be in that listing was not correct if we move helicopter 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.060
 let's see what this is 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.540
 moves forward backward 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.010
 also if we move in this case delta the command and control 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.920
 Let's see what 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.320
 the zero to the anbia moves 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 yes at the time of selling helicopters 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 we do not see in this one who we have to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.539
 Dr. Samuel means that it was not displayed correctly 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 now we see the tail of the ico but 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.190
 one of the main 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.370
 errors that prostrate the forum 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.820
 the corrector hand of the tail of the helicopter 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.930
 in this case we can see 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.920
 kiril turn of the spa the main crimes but 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 of bs in the same clockwise direction 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.530
 at the time of turning helicopter in the same direction that is the leaves area 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.570
 of the clock 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.470
 moment is now the shovels 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.940
 7th you to move 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.930
 that the tail of the coastal 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 in this case if we look at it so often repeated 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.659
 moves in one direction 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.659
 continue to spread the sense of humor 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.679
 then famous turn it 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.719
 the main blades 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.219
 and let's see what 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.719
 the turn 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.719
 of the tail is in the reverse direction 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 clockwise 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.020
 Now what we are going to do is moderate the style of the radio 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.020
 to the right 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.909
 there we are moving to the right iraola 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.939
 let's prioritize a bit the national radio made change 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.379
 we can say when 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.549
 this tribe right ounce the wind and the ite 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.080
 percent pushed 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.390
 towards that direction causing the tail to go in the opposite direction 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.599
 as well as helicopter or control 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.399
 the direction of his tail driving 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:59.699
 the angle 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.619
 d the attack 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.619
 of the tail shovels 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.880
 now, whether or not you have increased the radio test to leave it by the tail 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.999
 in the center of the axis 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.919
 the rear axle and move to see it in this case to the right 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.189
 and we see what the moderator cast according to the left 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.879
 be the queen is that always 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.019
 moves in the opposite position to how we are moving other electic of the 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.079
 radio 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.189
 always take into consideration 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.129
 I said the direction of rotation 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.229
 of bs 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.229
 counterclockwise 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.469
 a very good practice is to take pictures of our and Coptic 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.539
 before being bad so as to have a reference 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.459
 of how we have it is bad once 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.459
 that we have made a revolution 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.899
 now we will make the correct configuration in installation of 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.689
 faces and cop 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.519
 they all have a switch 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.679
 review 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.740
 the compensation direction 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.299
 either normal by rivers 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.779
 in this case if we move the istic uncontrol does the right 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.559
 the helicopter must move the tail they want 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.800
 if we move it to the left the smoke helicopter in which it does the 

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:27.799
 right 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.370
 if we put our finger and tail of the helicopter 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.870
 and we move by helicopter for a hundred 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.870
 does the right and to the left 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.139
 we will feel the compensation made by the gyroscope 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.059
 to the movement that we are making 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.159
 this compensation the aleve mitigate the cocker a flight 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.849
 Keep your tail in one direction only and do not start spinning 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.849
 its own axis 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.590
 that when moving the tail of the helicopter 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.580
 the gyroscope compensates the movement does not mean that it is correctly sea 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.479
 helicopter 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.689
 what we have to have control 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.750
 at the moment of putting our finger 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.539
 Colo colo because the image 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.349
 and move it to the right 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.120
 feel that you are not pressing on beautiful 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.759
 there in him we can have the certainty 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.759
 dec and the helicopter is correctly 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.370
 always before each flight 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.110
 we have to make sure 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.919
 of the controls either 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.849
 to the right they are lost 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.870
 of the control of the movement of the tail 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.740
 the control of the main blades 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
 before each flight 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.669
 well I hope this video 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.220
 there they have served 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.530
 help for people has their helicopter 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.129
 percent I've tried swallows son of another American video 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.050
 in the best way 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.669
 and I hope to be able to upload in the future more more videos I found very interesting 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.610
 and a lot of help 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.119
 so thank you very much i 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.799
 that is very well
