00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.150 
the situation it's just a soft box with
a<00:02:23.340> couple<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:24.470> lights<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:25.769> puts<00:02:26.010> out

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
a couple of lights and then puts out

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.539 
a couple of lights and then puts out
quite<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> bit<00:02:27.650> quite<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> bit<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.920> light<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.310> think

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
quite a bit quite a bit of light I think

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.550 
quite a bit quite a bit of light I think
it's<00:02:30.980> summer<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.190> water<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.489> 300<00:02:32.940> watts<00:02:33.150> or

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's summer in the water of 300 watts or

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.820 
it's summer in the water of 300 watts or
thereabouts--<00:02:35.629> but<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.900> control<00:02:37.080> each

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
moving everything into here was just

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.470 
moving everything into here was just
really<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> crucial<00:04:24.220> milestone<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:26.150> make<00:04:26.300> sure

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
really a crucial milestone to make sure

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.000

that<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.750> happens<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:30.230> there<00:04:30.380> we<00:04:30.440> go<00:04:30.470> guys<00:04:30.770> I

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
that that happens so there we go guys I

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.850 
that that happens so there we go guys I
think<00:04:31.190> we<00:04:31.280> might<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:32.200> leave<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.380> there<00:04:33.710> and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860
