quick a little bit about the the update
that<00:00:12.869> I'm<00:00:12.959> doing<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.350> my<00:00:13.410> vci<00:00:13.860> 100<00:00:14.490> I'm

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
that I'm doing for my vci 100 I'm

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.300 
that I'm doing for my vci 100 I'm
basically<00:00:15.750> switching<00:00:16.289> out<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.470> bottom<00:00:17.010> eight

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
basically switching out the bottom eight

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.180 
basically switching out the bottom eight
buttons<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.480> arcade<00:00:19.140> buttons<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
buttons for arcade buttons to make it

more playable more cool so here the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.560 
more playable more cool so here the
thing<00:00:23.700> is<00:00:23.940> like<00:00:24.890> mid-construction<00:00:26.360> I've<00:00:27.360> got

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
thing is like mid-construction I've got

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.440 
thing is like mid-construction I've got
all<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.590> wires<00:00:28.830> stripped<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.850> rerouted

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
all the the wires stripped and rerouted

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.260 
all the the wires stripped and rerouted
basically<00:00:31.020> these<00:00:31.950> are<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.250> old<00:00:32.550> buttons<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
basically these are the old buttons I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.020 
basically these are the old buttons I
just<00:00:34.280> clipped<00:00:35.280> these<00:00:35.550> cables<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:38.790> had

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
just clipped these cables here and I had

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.690 
just clipped these cables here and I had
to<00:00:39.150> put<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:40.380> resistors<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.489> few

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to put in some some resistors and a few

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.940 
to put in some some resistors and a few
other<00:00:41.850> things<00:00:41.970> but<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.420> pretty<00:00:42.570> simple

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
thing is that basically with these

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.709 
thing is that basically with these
arcade<00:01:04.949> buttons<00:01:05.280> i<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.759> do<00:01:06.000> kind<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.509> like

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
arcade buttons i can do kind of like

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.649 
arcade buttons i can do kind of like
crab<00:01:07.020> scratches<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.909> allows<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.539> more

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
crab scratches it allows a little more

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
crab scratches it allows a little more
playable<00:01:10.319> surface<00:01:10.829> area<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.249> they're<00:01:11.549> much

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
playable surface area and they're much

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.969 
playable surface area and they're much
quicker<00:01:12.509> on<00:01:12.749> the<00:01:12.780> response<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.530> let<00:01:13.740> me<00:01:13.829> show

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
quicker on the response so let me show

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:39.609 
quicker on the response so let me show
you<00:01:14.009> what<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.280> talking<00:01:14.310> about

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.919 

so<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:40.799> basically<00:01:41.039> what<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.600> buttons

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
so that's basically what the the buttons

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.380 
so that's basically what the the buttons
going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.250> buttons<00:01:44.700> check<00:01:45.240> back

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
going to do or they buttons check back

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
going to do or they buttons check back
in<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.630> few<00:01:45.780> days<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> hopefully<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
in a few days when I hopefully get the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
in a few days when I hopefully get the
full<00:01:47.520> casing<00:01:47.970> back<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> machine<00:01:48.960> shop

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
full casing back from the machine shop

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
full casing back from the machine shop
where<00:01:49.950> they've<00:01:50.100> made<00:01:50.250> some<00:01:50.280> custom<00:01:50.789> cutouts

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
where they've made some custom cutouts

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.050 
where they've made some custom cutouts
to<00:01:51.929> fit<00:01:52.590> these<00:01:52.799> new<00:01:53.069> buttons<00:01:53.520> I'll<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.850> able<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to fit these new buttons I'll be able to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.119 
to fit these new buttons I'll be able to
show<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.679> of<00:01:55.709> them<00:01:55.950> work<00:01:56.130> piece
