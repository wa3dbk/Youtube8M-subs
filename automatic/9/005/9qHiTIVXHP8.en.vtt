00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.069
 As the campaign gets this side last week weather balloons do not you know well 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.790
 In just known to the fact of checking in time let's just throw all this nonsense 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.109
 Hope that sex is 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.799
 Uh ... we do sure yesterday they were restarting uh ... more welfare error ads 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.039
 Change a'bad 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.779
 Social Welfare to Work Retail requirements are not working anymore 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.130
 It did not happen to us on board people 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.859
 Or going out this is not true at all oh ... actually 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.059
 The request of the rulers of the Republic for this change makes reality 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.970
 You know how Obama makes it more think that wit 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.200
 Requires a better working condition and this is not opposed to the right to meet 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.790
 But absolutely and then put out our habit of showing you too 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.270
 About 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.430
 Alone God 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.680
 Cartman regular 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.400
 And dut in that 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.780
 Then he actually said 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.420
 Thank Ali 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.070
 Dubious contacts 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.440
 The effect of the backpacker itself is sent as true and cheap again in the genes 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.109
 China 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.470
 Because this sign it 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.240
 In China they do not move them from u_s_ AC to get rid of any 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.810
 Functions here if you exit the functions 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.000
 So it is premature that his resistance to peace is like Rooney 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.980
 All I'm loyal though 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.430
 But 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 That way if you at the same time we let me go bankrupt 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.930
 Not true remotely 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 You know what 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.780
 Big Baba Joe Biden was during these 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.049
 Go to the head of the organization 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.270
 In the final hours of this campaign 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 If you think it can 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.330
 There you run the most obscene that does not have a top 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.230
 You will be in a system setting which is in this 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.010
 Almost blatantly this town is as in every member of his political life mine 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.049
 That said a point he says that in general 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.250
 Serotonin 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.130
 Bought yet as a chat function only 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.260
 It is actually a checkers fact is actually those companies themselves attracted 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.940
 The classification of reality was Rooney 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.270
 Shorts on 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.320
 The way the information goes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.079
 And you know this is to mean that it's really a really big ally you might want to 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.380
 Japan soft 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.229
 Because you get burned all 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.879
 That would by the unfortunate way out with the Republicans in some 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.470
 So trouble then let's go to the actual communications companies now korva 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.059
 Chrysler may quote 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.349
 Less than a straight pocket record has no intention of converting the output from it 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.729
 Cheap models from North America to China 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.049
 In other words this 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.569
 What you say is Ron is not right at all now this is a very unusual companies away quit 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.619
 The week before the election seller they only use these companies 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.779
 They're lying about these companies so they said well I gotta have a record 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.399
 In fact here Greg Martin spokesman and general motors for it in 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:46.130
 Another radio ad was Rooney Tomato inserted along with the Chrysler SIS 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.259
 This is a cynical campaign policy at its worst 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.169
 Abstract from any 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:57.709
 Core understanding of all the global import of our industry is our love for them 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.339
 Look down 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.929
 All global manufacturers whether Ford GM or Chrysler v_w_ 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.649
 Historically built in the markets we sell 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.859
 So in other words your dumbass we can make the pocket cars in China that we sell to China 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.129
 We made James to sell for America at 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.230
 America uh ... birthday 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830
 We were not changing any of those that always weight is actually it should be 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.549
 Really happy 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.800
 All these different US companies are going on 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.819
 Its sales grow ten percent in 1413 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.889
 We are now selling American cars in China that this is not a bad thing it is 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.709
 A great day is brought as long as one of the transfer jobs we are not 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.999
 Rotated through it is not clear 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.279
 Cute UMA resposta uninstall continues to quote 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:44.019
 I entered with some parallel cosmic universe during the past few days 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.480
 No amount of policy in the worst cynical campaign 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.589
 Will reduce 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:51.569
 Register to create jobs at u_s_ and return profits to this 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.809
 country 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.530
 They call it only to live in a parallel world 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.059
 With the facts do not matter 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.169
 Samar 'cause this is exactly what the republic is too 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.059
 When challenged, of course, they said all and Med 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.719
 The giant said that uh ... you know the top side 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.209
 But it is not 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.919
 All right and asked about it that today is why it was so bad a lot come 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.149
 Iowa Agassi rave when I was pro-him what I have 

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:28.439
 Wait Wait Wait Wait 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.900
 But 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.899
 Fine 

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.210
 The 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.330
 What we really have to deal with these guys for another six days
