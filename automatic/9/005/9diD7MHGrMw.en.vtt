tearing<00:00:56.550> into<00:00:56.820> her<00:00:56.910> legs<00:00:57.239> she<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:57.809> felt

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
tearing into her legs she actually felt

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139 
tearing into her legs she actually felt
like<00:00:58.590> she<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.949> wanted<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> die<00:00:59.609> she<00:00:59.640> felt

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
like she just wanted to die she felt

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
like she just wanted to die she felt
like<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.510> she<00:01:00.690> lost<00:01:00.840> her<00:01:01.109> legs<00:01:01.320> she'd<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
like if she lost her legs she'd be a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
like if she lost her legs she'd be a
burden<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.309> her<00:01:02.460> family<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.030> she<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.600> actually

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
burden on her family so she was actually

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.329 
burden on her family so she was actually
at<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.350> point<00:01:04.409> thinking<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.159> would<00:01:05.309> be

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
at that point thinking it would be

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
at that point thinking it would be
better<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> bear<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.420> killed<00:01:06.720> her

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
better if the bear just killed her

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
better if the bear just killed her
that's<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.290> morbid<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.220> thinking

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that's a very morbid way to be thinking

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.270 
that's a very morbid way to be thinking
in<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.090> opinion<00:01:09.689> I'd<00:01:10.290> rather<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.950> alive

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
in my opinion I'd rather be alive

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
in my opinion I'd rather be alive
without<00:01:11.610> legs<00:01:12.090> than<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.780> alive<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.320> all<00:01:13.439> even

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
without legs than not alive at all even

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310 
without legs than not alive at all even
if<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.100> was<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.820> head<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> jar<00:01:15.479> I'd<00:01:16.110> rather

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
if I was just a head in a jar I'd rather

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.679 
if I was just a head in a jar I'd rather
be<00:01:16.650> alive<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> head<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> jar<00:01:18.180> than<00:01:18.479> not

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
be alive as a head in a jar than not

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
be alive as a head in a jar than not
alive<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.710> least<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.070> could<00:01:20.130> still

if a bear was attacking me would be to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140 
if a bear was attacking me would be to
punch<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.349> nose<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.730> punched<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
it works for a variety of different

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.330 
it works for a variety of different
animals<00:02:57.239> nobody<00:02:58.170> likes<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.530> get<00:02:58.739> punched<00:02:59.069> in

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340

animals nobody likes to get punched in
the<00:02:59.400> fucking<00:02:59.879> nose<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:00.659> I'd<00:03:00.780> only

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the fucking nose I think I'd only

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.449 
the fucking nose I think I'd only
accomplish<00:03:01.439> one<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.650> two<00:03:01.920> things<00:03:02.189> though<00:03:02.340> I'd

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
accomplish one of two things though I'd

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.979 
accomplish one of two things though I'd
either<00:03:02.609> punch<00:03:02.939> the<00:03:03.120> bear<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.480> nose<00:03:03.689> and

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
either punch the bear in the nose and

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.750 
either punch the bear in the nose and
he'd<00:03:04.139> run<00:03:04.349> away<00:03:04.409> like<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:04.920> little<00:03:05.010> bitch<00:03:05.250> or<00:03:05.730> I

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
he'd run away like a little bitch or I

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.129 
he'd run away like a little bitch or I
punch<00:03:05.879> him<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.359> nose<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.959> get

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
punch him in the nose and you just get

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.440 
punch him in the nose and you just get
really<00:03:07.829> really<00:03:08.159> fucking<00:03:08.700> pissed<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.239> just

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
really really fucking pissed and just

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.869 
really really fucking pissed and just
rip<00:03:09.780> me<00:03:09.930> apart<00:03:10.049> even<00:03:10.439> faster<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:11.400> attacked

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
rip me apart even faster if I attacked
