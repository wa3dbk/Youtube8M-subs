where<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> term<00:02:25.940> laid-back<00:02:26.240> comes<00:02:26.630> into<00:02:26.810> play

where the term laid-back comes into play

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.450 
where the term laid-back comes into play
is<00:02:27.050> when<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.710> kind<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.980> rotate<00:02:28.310> your

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
direction that your legs and the board's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320 
direction that your legs and the board's
going<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.040> you're<00:02:34.160> sort<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.820> laying<00:02:35.030> back<00:02:35.270> on

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
going so you're sort of laying back on

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.660 
going so you're sort of laying back on
the<00:02:35.510> face<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> wave<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.530> know<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.430> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the face of the wave you know and and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.850 
the face of the wave you know and and
pushing<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.360> rail<00:02:38.540> out<00:02:38.720> away<00:02:38.960> from<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:41.860> now

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
pushing the rail out away from you now

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.260 
pushing the rail out away from you now
you<00:02:42.920> can<00:02:43.100> really<00:02:43.310> lay<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.760> out<00:02:43.910> or<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.240> can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
you can really lay it out or you can

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.610 
you can really lay it out or you can
stay<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> little<00:02:44.870> tighter<00:02:45.080> over<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.440> top<00:02:45.590> of

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
stay a little tighter over the top of

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.070 
stay a little tighter over the top of
your<00:02:45.830> board<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.120> really<00:02:47.360> kind<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.900> I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
your board you can really kind of I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.290 
your board you can really kind of I
think<00:02:48.830> toy<00:02:49.130> with<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.550> technique<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.090> little

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
think toy with the technique a little

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.040 
think toy with the technique a little
bit<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:52.100> know<00:02:52.220> sort<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.640> add<00:02:53.050> different

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
bit and you know sort of add different

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.070 
bit and you know sort of add different
variations<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.430> angles<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.300> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
variations to the angles and and the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.020 
variations to the angles and and the
length<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.620> turn<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:58.130> think<00:02:58.460> when<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.910> comes

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
length of the turn I think when it comes

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.060 
length of the turn I think when it comes
to<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.540> lay<00:02:59.660> back<00:02:59.840> snap<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.260> think<00:03:00.440> repetition

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
to the lay back snap I think repetition

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.390 
to the lay back snap I think repetition
is<00:03:01.220> probably<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> key<00:03:01.930> repetition<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.890> just

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
is probably the key repetition and just

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.950 
is probably the key repetition and just
sticking<00:03:05.240> with<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.480> maneuver<00:03:05.840> and

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
sticking with the maneuver and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.160 
sticking with the maneuver and
continuing<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.500> try<00:03:06.740> it<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.450> don't<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:08.990> afraid

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
continuing to try it and don't be afraid

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.650 
continuing to try it and don't be afraid
to<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.620> know<00:03:09.740> go<00:03:10.460> into<00:03:10.700> into<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> turn<00:03:11.300> look<00:03:11.600> a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
to you know go into into the turn look a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.210 
to you know go into into the turn look a
little<00:03:11.810> goofy<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.320> know<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.590> because

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
little goofy you know it because

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.770 
little goofy you know it because
eventually<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.850> liar<00:03:14.000> not<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.390> kinks<00:03:14.720> and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
eventually you liar not the kinks and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.480 
eventually you liar not the kinks and
you'll<00:03:14.930> you'll<00:03:15.290> figure<00:03:15.470> out<00:03:15.620> like<00:03:15.980> exactly

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
you'll you'll figure out like exactly

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.910 
you'll you'll figure out like exactly
you<00:03:17.300> know<00:03:17.420> what<00:03:17.450> what<00:03:18.230> kind<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.890> know

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
you know what what kind of a you know

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.660 
you know what what kind of a you know
pressure<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.550> apply<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.030> turn

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
pressure you can apply to that turn

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.720 
pressure you can apply to that turn
