00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.420
 today I come to talk about a book of 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.760
 what I've been doing for a long time is 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.400
 one of the next incredible that I've 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.630
 read in my life I do not know if this kind of 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.550
 Literature like all of you 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.980
 although I think so because the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.379
 youth literature is talking about the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 number of the Mexican writer and she 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.720
 talking about love me five minutes of 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.720
 anahí lópez and well good of what 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.710
 is a 15 year old girl who in a 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.840
 moment is seen in the forced necessity of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.070
 go through many first times very 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 followed 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.949
 they are first times that not simply 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.200
 they cover her physically and mentally but 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.420
 that his friends to his family to his 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 brother and everything all around 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 then the movement she has to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.350
 learn to face them and learn to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.110
 live with it and make those 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.750
 first times they remain as experiences 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.830
 good but they come to affect in 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.350
 some point your future 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.510
 Elena is a real girl that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.970
 I love how you face all these 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.750
 first times because although they are 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.450
 very bad she is like ok if they are 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.940
 happening a lot of bad things I do not know what 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.980
 you do I'm about to explode but not 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.630
 they moved these bad things well because 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.090
 I know that after this something will come 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.950
 good as a reward and that's what a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.250
 she has it good where it is to me 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.680
 love that position that makes one of 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.140
 in front of all these things that are not 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.260
