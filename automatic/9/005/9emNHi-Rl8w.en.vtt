00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
i'll show you the bug first let's say

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
i'll show you the bug first let's say
you<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.199> item<00:00:25.439> shard<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> random

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you look up the item shard of a random

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
you look up the item shard of a random
item<00:00:26.550> let's<00:00:27.210> say<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.390> drag<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> rapier<00:00:28.019> chart

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
item let's say to drag a rapier chart

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
item let's say to drag a rapier chart
here<00:00:28.560> though<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.369> goes<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.090> these<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
here though it goes for all of these the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
here though it goes for all of these the
item<00:00:30.900> charts<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> put<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> graph<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.969> six

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
item charts and you put the graph to six

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
item charts and you put the graph to six
months<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.500> tell<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> step<00:00:35.130> graph

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
months you can tell it's a step graph

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.569 
months you can tell it's a step graph
which<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> okay<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:37.020> unusual<00:00:37.579> pretty

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
which is okay it's not an unusual pretty

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.389 
which is okay it's not an unusual pretty
much<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.750> case<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.320> low<00:00:40.680> volume<00:00:41.070> item

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
much the case for any low volume item

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
much the case for any low volume item
that<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.420> doesn't<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> whole<00:00:43.140> lot

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that just doesn't really get a whole lot

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.930 
that just doesn't really get a whole lot
of<00:00:43.290> updates<00:00:43.649> until<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> left

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
of updates until you look at the left

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
of updates until you look at the left
where<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.360> shows<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.750> pretty<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.079> every

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
where it shows that pretty much every

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.940 
where it shows that pretty much every
interval<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> 630<00:00:47.969> 1.3<00:00:48.600> k<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.770> that's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
interval here is 630 1.3 k so that's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
interval here is 630 1.3 k so that's
really<00:00:50.280> weird<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.510> actually<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.170> case

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
really weird and it's actually the case

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
really weird and it's actually the case
for<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.820> much<00:00:53.879> any<00:00:54.180> item<00:00:54.510> chart<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
for pretty much any item chart like

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
for pretty much any item chart like
let's<00:00:55.320> say<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.800> look<00:00:56.070> something<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.520> like

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
let's say if you look something up like

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.869 
let's say if you look something up like
the<00:00:57.600> pernix<00:00:58.079> cowell<00:00:59.010> chart<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.670> example<00:01:01.879> 6

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the pernix cowell chart for example 6

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
the pernix cowell chart for example 6
months<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.680> wow<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:04.979> only<00:01:05.189> risen

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
months here wow it's really only risen

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
months here wow it's really only risen
one<00:01:05.790> GP<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.659> tell<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> same

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
one GP but you can tell here the same

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
one GP but you can tell here the same
kind<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.479> intervals<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.350> really

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
kind of intervals so that's really

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
kind of intervals so that's really
strange<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.310> discover<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.150> our

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
strange actually discover this on our

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
strange actually discover this on our
own<00:01:12.780> website<00:01:13.409> first<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.040> dare<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> thought<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
own website first and dare I thought it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
own website first and dare I thought it
was<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> bug<00:01:15.360> related<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.900> us<00:01:16.080> until<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.830> actually

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
was a bug related to us until I actually

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.640 
was a bug related to us until I actually
checked<00:01:17.930> runescape<00:01:18.930> grand<00:01:19.140> exchange<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
checked runescape grand exchange and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.039 
checked runescape grand exchange and
notice<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> wasn't<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> bug<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.869> least

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
notice that it wasn't a bug or at least

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
notice that it wasn't a bug or at least
not<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.229> our<00:01:22.439> side<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.369> would<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.700> really

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
not on our side so it would be really

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
not on our side so it would be really
great<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.659> some<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> explanation

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
great to get some kind of explanation

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
great to get some kind of explanation
from<00:01:26.340> Jackson<00:01:26.939> why<00:01:27.689> exactly<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
from Jackson why exactly this is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
from Jackson why exactly this is
happening<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.920> least<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.189> fix<00:01:29.540> if<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.689> look

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
happening or at least a fix if you look

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.039 
happening or at least a fix if you look
it<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.229> our<00:01:31.320> website<00:01:32.600> try<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> rape<00:01:33.900> your

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it up on our website try to rape your

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.130 
it up on our website try to rape your
charge<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.890> well<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> doesn't<00:01:35.520> matter<00:01:35.729> really

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
charge or well it doesn't matter really

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.149 
charge or well it doesn't matter really
if<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.040> least

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
if you look it up there you can at least

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.469 
if you look it up there you can at least
hover<00:01:38.400> over<00:01:38.790> them<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
hover over them and you can see the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.289 
hover over them and you can see the
difference<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.530> 297<00:01:41.520> GP<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
difference like here it was 297 GP and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.139 
difference like here it was 297 GP and
here<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.320> end<00:01:43.530> its<00:01:43.680> 289<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.030> an

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
here at the end its 289 which is like an

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
here at the end its 289 which is like an
AGP<00:01:45.600> drop<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> half<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.009> time<00:01:47.310> which

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
AGP drop and half of your time which

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.450 
AGP drop and half of your time which
really<00:01:48.299> isn't<00:01:48.600> possible<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.829> look<00:01:50.220> at<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
really isn't possible if you look at the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.149 
really isn't possible if you look at the
all<00:01:50.670> view<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.439> they've<00:01:52.439> been<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:52.920> for

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
all view here they've been in game for

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
all view here they've been in game for
almost<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.520> year<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.110> just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
almost a year now and it really just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
almost a year now and it really just
seems<00:01:55.470> impossible<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.040> me<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.430> literally

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
seems impossible to me that literally

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.749 
seems impossible to me that literally
nobody<00:01:57.149> reported<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.259> no<00:01:58.770> J<00:01:59.009> simply<00:01:59.490> what

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
nobody reported this or no J simply what

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.060 
nobody reported this or no J simply what
so<00:01:59.939> ever<00:01:59.969> noticed<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.829> would<00:02:01.950> be

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
so ever noticed this so it would be

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
so ever noticed this so it would be
great<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> get<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> fix<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
great to get a fix on this because this

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
great to get a fix on this because this
is<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.020> quite<00:02:04.439> broken<00:02:05.009> there's<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.640> no

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
is just quite broken there's really no

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.280 
is just quite broken there's really no
reason<00:02:06.000> why<00:02:06.450> these<00:02:06.509> items<00:02:06.810> should<00:02:07.049> work

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
reason why these items should work

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589 
reason why these items should work
different<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> rest<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:09.119> why<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.330> should

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
different from the rest or why it should

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.180 
different from the rest or why it should
be<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.810> complicated<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> first

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
be this complicated at all in the first

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.370 
be this complicated at all in the first
place

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
place

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.010 
place
so<00:02:13.070> yeah<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.610> getting<00:02:14.600> back<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
so yeah that's that getting back to this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.800 
so yeah that's that getting back to this
page<00:02:15.320> um<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:16.760> those<00:02:16.880> who<00:02:16.910> don't<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
page um for those who don't know the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.110 
page um for those who don't know the
current<00:02:18.020> tier<00:02:18.290> 2<00:02:18.500> for<00:02:18.710> VIP<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.880> too

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
current tier 2 for VIP is really not too

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360 
current tier 2 for VIP is really not too
useful<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:21.470> made<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> plan<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.220> new

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
useful and I made a plan for a new

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.550 
useful and I made a plan for a new
version<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.850> long<00:02:23.030> time<00:02:23.270> ago<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:24.020> will<00:02:24.200> consist

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
version a long time ago it will consist

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800 
version a long time ago it will consist
of<00:02:24.800> three<00:02:25.100> tables<00:02:25.460> with<00:02:25.640> calculations<00:02:26.120> one

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
of three tables with calculations one

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.480 
of three tables with calculations one
with<00:02:27.020> shards<00:02:27.320> two<00:02:27.590> items<00:02:27.860> like<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.310> see

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
with shards two items like you can see

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.400 
with shards two items like you can see
here<00:02:28.730> though<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.240> is<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.900> first<00:02:30.110> test

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
here though this is just a first test

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.860 
here though this is just a first test
version<00:02:31.060> then<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> second<00:02:32.450> one<00:02:32.480> would<00:02:32.720> have

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
version then the second one would have

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.900 
version then the second one would have
materials<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.620> armors<00:02:33.950> like<00:02:34.280> malevolent

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
materials to armors like malevolent

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.660 
materials to armors like malevolent
energy<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.600> malevolent<00:02:36.290> hour<00:02:36.410> including<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
energy to malevolent hour including the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.780 
energy to malevolent hour including the
reinforcing<00:02:38.180> plate<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.900> serene<00:02:39.800> Excalibur

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
reinforcing plate and serene Excalibur

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.840 
reinforcing plate and serene Excalibur
and<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.780> third<00:02:41.990> table<00:02:42.200> will<00:02:42.620> be<00:02:42.830> one<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.400> items

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
and the third table will be one of items

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.490 
and the third table will be one of items
two<00:02:44.060> sets<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.660> these<00:02:44.900> would<00:02:45.050> all<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.380> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
two sets and these would all have the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.650 
two sets and these would all have the
live<00:02:45.710> prices<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.310> course<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.880> reflect<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
live prices of course to reflect the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.560 
live prices of course to reflect the
real<00:02:47.870> price<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:49.730> should<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.240> idea<00:02:50.480> of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
real price and this should the idea of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.330 
real price and this should the idea of
this<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.170> will<00:02:51.290> help<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> VIPs<00:02:51.980> with

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
this is that it will help the VIPs with

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.340 
this is that it will help the VIPs with
a<00:02:52.550> quick<00:02:53.030> overview<00:02:53.210> of<00:02:53.720> some<00:02:53.750> very<00:02:54.110> easy

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
a quick overview of some very easy

a quick overview of some very easy
short-term<00:02:54.800> investments<00:02:55.400> but<00:02:56.210> there<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.390> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
short-term investments but there is a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.970 
short-term investments but there is a
slight<00:02:56.780> problem<00:02:57.050> which<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.770> grand

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
slight problem which is that the grand

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.340 
slight problem which is that the grand
exchange<00:02:58.130> graphs<00:02:58.550> lag<00:02:58.910> behind<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.660> as<00:03:00.260> you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
exchange graphs lag behind and as you

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.650

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.620 
you're calculating it yourself which
makes<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:32.900> page<00:03:33.230> pretty<00:03:33.560> obsolete<00:03:34.570> but<00:03:35.570> I

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
makes this page pretty obsolete but I

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.300 
makes this page pretty obsolete but I
said<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.020> if<00:03:36.140> we<00:03:36.230> just<00:03:36.440> add<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.620> custom<00:03:36.890> field

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
said that if we just add a custom field

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.860 
said that if we just add a custom field
where<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.610> can<00:03:37.730> enter<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.210> price<00:03:38.390> yourself

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
where you can enter the price yourself

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.100 
where you can enter the price yourself
and<00:03:39.170> then<00:03:39.470> we<00:03:39.680> wait<00:03:39.920> for<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.850> price<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.450> adjust

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
and then we wait for the price to adjust

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.590 
and then we wait for the price to adjust
to<00:03:42.350> reflect<00:03:43.220> reality<00:03:43.459> then<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.480> would<00:03:44.570> be

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
to reflect reality then it would be

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.320 
to reflect reality then it would be
sorted<00:03:45.020> out<00:03:45.110> in<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.440> long<00:03:45.650> run<00:03:46.030> this<00:03:47.030> would<00:03:47.209> be

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
sorted out in the long run this would be

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.360 
sorted out in the long run this would be
especially<00:03:47.540> convenient<00:03:48.290> for<00:03:48.590> level<00:03:48.830> 90<00:03:49.100> armor

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
especially convenient for level 90 armor

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.840 
especially convenient for level 90 armor
and<00:03:49.550> not<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:49.880> much<00:03:49.910> for<00:03:50.270> shards<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.640> can

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
and not so much for shards and you can

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.160 
and not so much for shards and you can
basically<00:03:53.060> already<00:03:53.390> used<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:53.840> table<00:03:54.140> right

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
basically already used this table right

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.990 
basically already used this table right
now<00:03:54.440> based<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:54.950> bride<00:03:55.340> price<00:03:55.580> as<00:03:55.730> long<00:03:55.880> as

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
now based on this bride price as long as

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.420 
now based on this bride price as long as
you<00:03:56.090> stay<00:03:56.330> below<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.810> while<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.950> price<00:03:58.190> is

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
you stay below this while the price is

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.610 
you stay below this while the price is
this<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.060> it's<00:03:59.480> perfectly<00:04:00.020> fine<00:04:00.320> it's

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
this then it's perfectly fine it's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.550 
this then it's perfectly fine it's
usable<00:04:01.070> but<00:04:01.910> in<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.690> long<00:04:02.870> term<00:04:02.900> this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.380> not

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
usable but in the long term this is not

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.650 
usable but in the long term this is not
going<00:04:03.740> to<00:04:03.830> be<00:04:04.010> fixed<00:04:04.280> either<00:04:04.400> because<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.030> this

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
going to be fixed either because of this

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.020 
going to be fixed either because of this
shard<00:04:06.620> panic<00:04:06.980> change<00:04:07.190> price<00:04:07.370> simply<00:04:07.820> not

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
shard panic change price simply not

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.120 
shard panic change price simply not
updating<00:04:08.600> it's<00:04:08.750> always<00:04:09.080> going<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.560> show<00:04:10.100> a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
updating it's always going to show a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.820 
updating it's always going to show a
negative<00:04:10.790> profit<00:04:11.080> which<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.380> pretty

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
negative profit which is pretty

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.070 
negative profit which is pretty
unfortunate<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:14.360> it<00:04:14.420> would<00:04:14.510> be<00:04:14.660> great<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:14.900> get

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
unfortunate so it would be great to get

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.849 
unfortunate so it would be great to get
it<00:04:15.200> fixed<00:04:15.470> on<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.590> from<00:04:15.980> jagex<00:04:17.560> yeah<00:04:18.560> that's

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
it fixed on that from jagex yeah that's

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.039 
it fixed on that from jagex yeah that's
pretty<00:04:18.980> much<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.239> meantime<00:04:20.479> I'll<00:04:20.870> just

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
pretty much it in the meantime I'll just

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.280 
pretty much it in the meantime I'll just
continue<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:21.590> work<00:04:21.799> on<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:23.630> next<00:04:23.810> video<00:04:24.050> which
