00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
okay so the basic parts that we're going

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.800 
okay so the basic parts that we're going
to<00:00:46.280> run<00:00:46.430> through<00:00:46.670> here<00:00:46.940> are<00:00:47.180> we're<00:00:47.600> going<00:00:47.720> to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
to run through here are we're going to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.680 
to run through here are we're going to
use<00:00:47.930> a<00:00:47.960> ball<00:00:48.470> jar<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:49.040> mason<00:00:49.820> jar<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.030> standard

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
use a ball jar a mason jar a standard

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.299 
use a ball jar a mason jar a standard
canning<00:00:51.080> jar<00:00:51.320> these<00:00:51.739> work<00:00:51.950> really<00:00:51.980> well

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
canning jar these work really well

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.770 
canning jar these work really well
because<00:00:52.640> they're<00:00:52.940> designed<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:53.420> take<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
because they're designed to take the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.479 
because they're designed to take the
heat<00:00:53.989> but<00:00:54.320> if<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.680> need<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.100> can<00:00:55.280> use<00:00:55.460> a

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
heat but if you need you can use a

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.690 
heat but if you need you can use a
pickle<00:00:55.910> jar<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.480> pint<00:00:57.320> glass<00:00:57.610> anything<00:00:58.610> you

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
pickle jar a pint glass anything you

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
have but make sure that it's glass don't

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.150 
have but make sure that it's glass don't
use<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.070> plastic<00:01:02.260> jar<00:01:03.260> for<00:01:03.470> anything<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:03.949> this

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
use a plastic jar for anything like this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.820 
use a plastic jar for anything like this
because<00:01:04.670> there<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.000> some<00:01:05.180> heat<00:01:05.330> involved

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
because there is some heat involved

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.370 
because there is some heat involved

recommended we've tried it it doesn't
work<00:02:25.250> really<00:02:25.459> well<00:02:25.579> because<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.180> cross

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.040 

okay<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.069> we've<00:02:34.220> taken<00:02:34.250> our<00:02:34.640> wire<00:02:34.849> we've<00:02:35.810> bent

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
okay so we've taken our wire we've bent

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110 
okay so we've taken our wire we've bent
it<00:02:36.200> into<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> shape<00:02:36.769> that's<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.909> to<00:02:37.970> hold

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
it into the shape that's going to hold

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.970 
it into the shape that's going to hold
the<00:02:38.269> wick<00:02:38.480> up<00:02:39.409> off<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.010> bottom<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
the wick up off the bottom we have the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.720 
the wick up off the bottom we have the
coil<00:02:43.310> here<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.790> holds<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.239> wick<00:02:44.440> perfectly

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
coil here that holds the wick perfectly

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.100 
coil here that holds the wick perfectly
we<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:46.940> handle<00:02:47.299> we're<00:02:47.720> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> drop

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
we have the handle we're going to drop

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.380 
we have the handle we're going to drop
this<00:02:48.349> straight<00:02:48.680> into<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:48.980> jar<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:50.180> like

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
this straight into the jar just like

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.850 
this straight into the jar just like
this<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.890> can<00:02:52.040> drop<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:53.680> we're<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.799> to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
this that can drop in we're going to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.009 
this that can drop in we're going to
fill<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.160> up<00:02:55.250> with<00:02:55.310> oil<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.269> just<00:02:56.569> below<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
fill it up with oil to just below the

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.780 
fill it up with oil to just below the
coil<00:02:57.290> level<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:58.099> should<00:02:58.340> end<00:02:58.489> up<00:02:58.640> with

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
coil level we should end up with

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.360 
coil level we should end up with
something<00:02:59.000> looks<00:02:59.420> basically<00:02:59.629> like<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.370> now

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
something looks basically like this now

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.680 
something looks basically like this now
we<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.790> our<00:03:02.090> olive<00:03:03.049> oil<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:03.409> there<00:03:03.440> are<00:03:04.690> oil

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
we have our olive oil in there are oil

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.520 
we have our olive oil in there are oil
holding<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.290> wick<00:03:06.470> above<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.010> oil<00:03:07.370> level<00:03:07.640> and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
holding the wick above the oil level and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.429 
holding the wick above the oil level and
I<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:09.890> we're<00:03:10.040> ready<00:03:10.069> to<00:03:10.430> give<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:10.700> light

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.690 

so<00:03:14.439> we've<00:03:14.560> got<00:03:14.709> our<00:03:14.739> parts<00:03:15.069> together<00:03:15.220> here

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
so we've got our parts together here

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.880 
so we've got our parts together here
we're<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.420> go<00:03:16.569> ahead<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:17.019> lift<00:03:17.230> with<00:03:17.860> a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
we're going to go ahead and lift with a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.770 
we're going to go ahead and lift with a
handle<00:03:18.340> we're<00:03:18.760> going<00:03:18.849> to<00:03:18.909> go<00:03:19.090> ahead<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.420> light

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
handle we're going to go ahead and light

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.940 
handle we're going to go ahead and light
the<00:03:19.989> oil<00:03:20.230> lamp<00:03:20.500> there<00:03:22.379> we've<00:03:23.379> got<00:03:23.409> it<00:03:23.709> set<00:03:23.739> up

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the oil lamp there we've got it set up

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.679 
the oil lamp there we've got it set up
so<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:26.280> coil<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.459> wire<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.970> holding<00:03:28.329> it<00:03:28.420> just

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:28.689 
so the coil of wire is holding it just

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.990 
so the coil of wire is holding it just
above<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.049> level<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.950> oil<00:03:30.189> we've<00:03:30.879> got

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
above the level of the oil we've got

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.149 
above the level of the oil we've got
enough<00:03:31.209> oil<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:31.689> here<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.109> last<00:03:32.140> many<00:03:32.890> many

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
enough oil in here to last many many

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.910 
enough oil in here to last many many
hours<00:03:33.540> we're<00:03:34.540> going<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.720> go<00:03:34.900> ahead<00:03:34.930> put<00:03:35.890> a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
hours we're going to go ahead put a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.410 
hours we're going to go ahead put a
little<00:03:36.129> maybe<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.370> little<00:03:36.670> Luminum<00:03:37.150> foil

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
reflector there that works pretty well

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.610 
reflector there that works pretty well
we<00:03:39.909> found<00:03:40.090> what<00:03:40.299> works<00:03:40.569> even<00:03:40.780> better<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.260> just

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
we found what works even better is just

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.170 
we found what works even better is just

some standard white paper behind it you

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.539 
some standard white paper behind it you
