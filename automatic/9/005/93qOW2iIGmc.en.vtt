watched my channel for a while you might
have<00:00:26.440> noticed<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:26.890> I'll<00:00:27.040> often<00:00:27.250> mentioned

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
have noticed that I'll often mentioned

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.640 
have noticed that I'll often mentioned
that<00:00:27.790> it<00:00:27.940> lens<00:00:28.210> suffers<00:00:28.960> from<00:00:29.170> chromatic

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
that it lens suffers from chromatic

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.830 
that it lens suffers from chromatic
aberration<00:00:30.369> but<00:00:31.240> then<00:00:31.360> I'll<00:00:31.450> be<00:00:31.540> quick<00:00:31.720> to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
aberration but then I'll be quick to

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.119 
aberration but then I'll be quick to
mention<00:00:32.140> that<00:00:32.260> fortunately<00:00:32.800> a<00:00:32.830> chromatic

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
mention that fortunately a chromatic

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.619 
mention that fortunately a chromatic
aberration<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.879> one<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.120> those<00:00:34.210> things<00:00:34.510> that

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
aberration is one of those things that

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.840 
aberration is one of those things that
can<00:00:34.870> be<00:00:34.930> very<00:00:35.110> quickly<00:00:35.410> fixed<00:00:36.100> with<00:00:36.580> just<00:00:36.760> a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
can be very quickly fixed with just a

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.250 
can be very quickly fixed with just a
couple<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.210> clicks<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.690> programs<00:00:38.110> like

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
couple of clicks and programs like

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.979 
couple of clicks and programs like
Lightroom<00:00:38.800> 6<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:40.239> I<00:00:40.270> didn't<00:00:40.510> realize<00:00:40.540> is<00:00:40.900> how

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
Lightroom 6 what I didn't realize is how

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.479 
Lightroom 6 what I didn't realize is how
many<00:00:41.140> folks<00:00:41.350> apparently<00:00:41.860> didn't<00:00:42.309> know

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
many folks apparently didn't know

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.850 
many folks apparently didn't know
exactly<00:00:43.210> how<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.570> fix<00:00:43.840> chromatic<00:00:44.290> aberrations

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
exactly how to fix chromatic aberrations

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.890 
exactly how to fix chromatic aberrations
so<00:00:45.550> what<00:00:45.790> I<00:00:45.820> thought<00:00:46.000> I'd<00:00:46.180> do<00:00:46.330> is<00:00:46.360> show<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:46.750> how

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
so what I thought I'd do is show you how

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.630 
so what I thought I'd do is show you how
to<00:00:47.140> fix<00:00:47.500> it<00:00:47.620> with<00:00:47.770> just<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.040> couple<00:00:48.159> of<00:00:48.370> clicks

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
to fix it with just a couple of clicks

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.910 
to fix it with just a couple of clicks
in<00:00:48.790> library<00:00:49.150> now<00:00:50.080> before<00:00:50.409> we<00:00:50.470> do<00:00:50.589> that<00:00:50.620> what

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
in library now before we do that what

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.310 
in library now before we do that what
exactly<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.460> chromatic<00:00:52.000> aberration<00:00:52.540> well

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
exactly is chromatic aberration well

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.420 
exactly is chromatic aberration well
without<00:00:53.589> getting<00:00:53.710> into<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.070> big<00:00:54.250> long

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430

aberration<00:00:56.620> happens<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.519> transition

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210

and really dark areas sometimes it's

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.640

not so much now the image here that
we're<00:01:18.310> looking<00:01:18.549> at<00:01:18.700> was<00:01:18.850> taken<00:01:19.120> with<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> Sony

was shot at at one point four and if you

was shot at at one point four and if you
look<00:01:27.789> over<00:01:27.939> here<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.539> left<00:01:28.719> you<00:01:29.020> can<00:01:29.170> see

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
look over here to the left you can see

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.709 
look over here to the left you can see
that<00:01:29.409> there<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.130> ton<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.670> purple<00:01:31.299> fringing

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
that there is a ton of purple fringing

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.719 
that there is a ton of purple fringing
the<00:01:32.500> sunlight<00:01:32.859> hit<00:01:33.009> these<00:01:33.130> puddles<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.670> water

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
the sunlight hit these puddles of water

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.870 
the sunlight hit these puddles of water
and<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.570> transition<00:01:35.079> is<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.229> really<00:01:35.649> ugly

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and the transition is a really ugly

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270 
and the transition is a really ugly
purple<00:01:36.880> fringy<00:01:37.479> kind<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.899> thing<00:01:38.109> but<00:01:38.920> actually

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
purple fringy kind of thing but actually

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.770 
purple fringy kind of thing but actually
in<00:01:39.369> this<00:01:39.460> image<00:01:39.789> I<00:01:39.939> kind<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.240> take<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.479> purple

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
in this image I kind of take the purple

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.120 
in this image I kind of take the purple
fringing<00:01:41.079> sort<00:01:41.469> of<00:01:41.560> adds<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.100> overall

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
fringing sort of adds to the overall

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.240 
fringing sort of adds to the overall
grunge<00:01:42.969> enos<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.689> scene<00:01:43.990> but<00:01:44.740> anyway<00:01:45.100> what

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
grunge enos of the scene but anyway what

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.340 
grunge enos of the scene but anyway what
we<00:01:45.310> want<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.609> do<00:01:45.729> is<00:01:46.149> remove<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.750> purple

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
we want to do is remove that purple

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.039 
we want to do is remove that purple
stuff<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.979> Lightroom<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.119> here's<00:01:49.659> how<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.869> do

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
stuff with Lightroom so here's how we do

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.620 
stuff with Lightroom so here's how we do
it<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:51.520> what<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.759> want<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:51.969> do<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.119> click<00:01:52.450> on

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
it first what you want to do is click on

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.950 
it first what you want to do is click on

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
voila just like that no chromatic

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.050 
voila just like that no chromatic
aberrations<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.860> truth<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.520> not<00:02:42.580> always

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
aberrations now in truth it's not always

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.420 
aberrations now in truth it's not always
this<00:02:43.240> simple<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.740> like<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.040> often

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
this simple but it's like this often

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.430 
this simple but it's like this often
enough<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.540> when<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.720> hear<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.020> lens<00:02:47.230> has

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
enough so when you hear that a lens has

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.920 
enough so when you hear that a lens has
chromatic<00:02:47.860> aberration<00:02:48.340> problems<00:02:48.760> well<00:02:49.090> fear

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
chromatic aberration problems well fear

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.870 
chromatic aberration problems well fear
not<00:02:50.080> because<00:02:50.470> clearly<00:02:50.890> Lightroom<00:02:51.490> can<00:02:51.670> save

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
