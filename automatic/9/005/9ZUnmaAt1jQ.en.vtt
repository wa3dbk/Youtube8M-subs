00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.580
Hello Loïc! Thank you for spending some time with us during the Rennes Tattoo Convention.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.087
You're from Geneva.

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:15.202
Exactly.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.380
You started tattooing not lot ago; how long exactly?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.718
It's been 2,5 years.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.520
You already have a great style;

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.480
And impressive skills.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.960
I'm not the one who can say that.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.800
That's what we think and we mean it.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.620
You used to be a web graphic designer.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.592
Multimedia designer actually.

00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:41.851
It's everything that has to do with graphic arts.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.800
And with the creation within every multimedia ways.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.360
But I wanted to do more manual works.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.640
I discovered tattoos and I really liked it.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.800
Because you can propose many different things.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.060
Talk with your customer and see what he really likes.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.440
There's more communication with someone you're about to ink.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.060
Tattooing gives you a special bond with your client.

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:11.396
Most of them are impressed;

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.240
When it's their 1st tattoo.

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:17.716
So I think it's very important to talk with them

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.540
Tell me what you really whant and we'll try to make it work out.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.000
And if you don't like it; you must tell me so we'll try something else.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.240
The most important is to understand what they have in their mind.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.720
I'm afraid they'll think "the tattooer might be upset if I ask him to change parts of the drawing".

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:35.878
But they'll be wearing it in the end.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.940
Other than your style; you have a particular way of drawing patterns.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560
You like to use the term "grotesque".

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.600
Exactly.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.980
it's a strange world; like a cabinet of curiosities.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.140
Very dreamy as well.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160
It's always been like that?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.080
It came along I guess.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.680
As a student I started creating t-shirts.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.760
But I already was attracted to this weird world of grotesque.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.340
This kind of ... "ugly things"

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.162
That actually look good.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.500
No one can decide what is beautiful or not.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.080
Everybody has his own way of seeing things

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.860
I have my own interpretation of things.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.518
And the person in front of me;

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.980
I don't need and I don't want to explain what it means.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.740
I want people to take it as it is.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.283
And understand it in their own way.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.780
Sometimes it's frustrating when people ask me what I was thinking when I made my drawings.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.960
The goal is that it means something to YOU.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.380
It's true that your tattoos are like a canvas;

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.520
When you look at how the pattern is made;

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.100
Anyone can see it differently.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.300
The graphic design in the end looks great.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.160
It's really nice of you to say that.

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:05.512
Is it your 1st time here in Rennes?

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:07.475
No, I was there last October.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.960
I worked at Atomik Tattoo as a guest for 1 week.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.760
I loved it.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.000
People were receptive.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.060
Now we're here, so we'll see how it goes.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.491
I'm sure you'll do well.

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.636
Let's hope so!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340
I won't say it if it doesn't...

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.520
If you were a super hero;

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.640
Which one would you be?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.660
I have a really bad super hero knowledge...

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.900
So I'm gonna go with...

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.715
The Joker.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.880
He's not a super hero but...

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500
It could work.

00:03:43.842 --> 00:03:45.842
I like his way of thinking.

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:47.171
Road Runner or Wile E Coyote?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.900
Road Runner.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.080
You're more of a Road Runner?

00:03:49.253 --> 00:03:51.253
Yeah, always going fast.

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:52.503
Running all the time?

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:53.538
At least trying to.

00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:55.187
We'l see what happens.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.460
Speaking of running; what are your projects for the future?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.460
For now, my main goal is to learn as much as I can.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.726
And meet new people.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.760
And I love travelling.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.780
I'll end my french road trip next week in Caen.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.420
And then, off to Montreal, Canada.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.460
If by any chance we come to Switzerland can we stop by your shop?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.380
Nah don't bother.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.723
Oh that's to bad...

00:04:21.723 --> 00:04:23.354
So we'll never see you agin...

00:04:23.354 --> 00:04:25.213
Oh my God, what are we gonna do?!

00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:26.570
Of course you can come.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.440
I'll have a few weird things to show you.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.414
You've already seen some on my stand.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.000
Just so people now; on Loïc's stand there's a...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.080
Bicephalous rat.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.720
From his cabinet of curiosities.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.160
I have other stuff like that in Geneva.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.400
Thanks a lot Loïc.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.141
Thank you.

00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:44.800
Have a good convention.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.340
Thanks.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.240
Color My Skin wishes to thank Mikaël de Poissy; Miss Atomik; Cécile Lasalle and every participant to the 2015 Rennes Tattoo Convention.
