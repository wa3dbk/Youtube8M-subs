actually<00:01:30.610> work<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.210> alright<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.720> I've

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
actually work it's alright and I've

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.350 
actually work it's alright and I've
tried<00:01:32.289> not<00:01:32.319> like<00:01:32.860> he<00:01:32.950> tried<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:33.429> but<00:01:35.220> yeah<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
tried not like he tried it but yeah it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.010 
tried not like he tried it but yeah it
actually<00:01:37.539> works<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:40.060> reason<00:01:40.270> why<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.659> actually

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
actually works the reason why I actually

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.109 
actually works the reason why I actually
shed<00:01:41.409> is<00:01:41.530> theory<00:01:41.950> if<00:01:42.099> you<00:01:42.130> fellow<00:01:42.580> friends

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
shed is theory if you fellow friends

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.520 
shed is theory if you fellow friends
family<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.670> love<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.390> guys<00:01:49.530> and

partially because I think come to people

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.120 
partially because I think come to people
with<00:01:52.420> road<00:01:52.630> rage<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.560> pretty<00:01:53.770> sad<00:01:54.009> to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
with road rage and it's pretty sad to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.919 
with road rage and it's pretty sad to
watch<00:01:54.310> people<00:01:54.729> with<00:01:54.849> rich<00:01:55.270> fight<00:01:55.569> each<00:01:55.750> other

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and curse at each other so that's why so

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.199 
and curse at each other so that's why so
that's<00:01:58.539> why<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:03.280> why<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:03.700> sort<00:02:04.119> of
