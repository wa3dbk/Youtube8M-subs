and<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.610> in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
and get it going in

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.490 
and get it going in
you'll<00:01:01.510> see<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.780> go<00:01:01.930> it's<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.199> little<00:01:02.379> bit

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
you'll see it go it's a little bit

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.750 
you'll see it go it's a little bit
quicker<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.860> she<00:01:05.920> lined<00:01:06.190> up<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.460> little<00:01:06.640> bit

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
quicker so she lined up a little bit

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.840 
quicker so she lined up a little bit
more<00:01:06.880> there

like I mentioned on the other review the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.050 
like I mentioned on the other review the
the<00:02:03.270> railing<00:02:04.340> for<00:02:05.340> any<00:02:05.580> mourners<00:02:05.880> has<00:02:06.030> a

the railing for any mourners has a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.260 
the railing for any mourners has a
really<00:02:06.800> angular<00:02:07.800> cut<00:02:09.110> case<00:02:10.310> which<00:02:11.310> remains

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
really angular cut case which remains

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.810 
really angular cut case which remains
unchanged<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.960> motors<00:02:13.230> teeth

unchanged for the motors teeth

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.770 
unchanged for the motors teeth
essentially<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.940> only<00:02:15.030> differences<00:02:15.600> between

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
essentially the only differences between

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.300 
essentially the only differences between
the<00:02:16.110> two<00:02:16.260> are<00:02:16.290> their<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.830> finish<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the two are their the finish on the

the two are their the finish on the
bezel<00:02:17.460> are<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> finish<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530

of<00:02:25.650> course<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> case<00:02:26.160> back<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.760> is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
of course the case back on this one is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.140 
of course the case back on this one is
the<00:02:27.090> cars<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> motors<00:02:28.260> does<00:02:28.470> not<00:02:28.710> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
the cars and the motors does not and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.370 
the cars and the motors does not and
that's<00:02:30.150> essentially<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> only<00:02:30.870> differences

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
