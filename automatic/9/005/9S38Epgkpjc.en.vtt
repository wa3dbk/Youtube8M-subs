00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
trilogy but that doesn't necessarily

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.900 
trilogy but that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.379> there<00:00:45.710> won't<00:00:45.739> be<00:00:46.070> more<00:00:46.339> games<00:00:46.670> in

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
mean that there won't be more games in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.509

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
the jak and daxter universe that even

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.910 
the jak and daxter universe that even
feature<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.510> focus<00:00:50.989> on<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.230> same<00:00:51.410> characters

after you complete jak 3 you'll

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.569 
after you complete jak 3 you'll
understand<00:00:54.199> how<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.620> possible<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.339> I

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
understand how this is possible but I

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.369 
understand how this is possible but I
can't<00:00:56.089> really<00:00:56.150> get<00:00:56.360> into<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.690> because<00:00:56.900> the

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
can't really get into that because the

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.930 
can't really get into that because the
game<00:00:57.559> has<00:00:57.589> a<00:00:57.800> lot<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.040> twists<00:00:58.489> in<00:00:58.610> terms<00:00:58.790> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.350 
game has a lot of twists in terms of
storylines<00:00:59.589> what<00:01:00.589> it<00:01:00.680> does<00:01:00.860> do<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.129> wrap<00:01:02.059> up<00:01:02.269> a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
storylines what it does do is wrap up a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.119 
storylines what it does do is wrap up a
lot<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.720> loose<00:01:02.900> ends<00:01:03.140> from<00:01:03.320> Jack<00:01:03.619> to<00:01:03.799> and

great<00:01:22.490> segment<00:01:23.150> unfortunately<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.259> gameplay

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
great segment unfortunately the gameplay

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
involves dying a lot because it's pretty

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.890

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
but it's so challenging that I'd say

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.790

enough to allow me to win the only thing
i<00:04:20.440> am<00:04:20.560> thinking<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.070> everything's<00:04:21.820> so

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
i am thinking is that everything's so

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.670 
i am thinking is that everything's so
responsive<00:04:22.600> but<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.870> only<00:04:23.050> way<00:04:23.320> i'm<00:04:23.470> actually

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
responsive but the only way i'm actually

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.010 
responsive but the only way i'm actually
losing<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.730> because<00:04:24.970> i'm<00:04:25.120> simply<00:04:25.570> not<00:04:25.750> good

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
losing is because i'm simply not good

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.960 
losing is because i'm simply not good
enough<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.320> defeat<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:26.950> challenge<00:04:27.430> as<00:04:27.910> i

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
enough to defeat this challenge as i

enough to defeat this challenge as i
mentioned<00:04:28.360> in<00:04:28.419> my<00:04:28.450> review<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.200> little

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
mentioned in my review it's a little

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.080 
mentioned in my review it's a little
tough<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.650> admit<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.190> just<00:04:30.460> off<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.730> bat<00:04:30.910> you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
tough to admit this just off the bat you

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.730 
tough to admit this just off the bat you
know<00:04:31.150> what<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.330> suck<00:04:31.690> at<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.900> game<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.470> it's<00:04:32.620> not

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
know what I suck at a game but it's not

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.170 
know what I suck at a game but it's not
really<00:04:32.919> like<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.820> game<00:04:34.000> gets

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
really like that it's that the game gets

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.240 
really like that it's that the game gets
harder<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.630> harder<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.620> when<00:04:35.950> you<00:04:36.070> do

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
harder and harder so that when you do

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.790 
harder and harder so that when you do
lose

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
lose

feel<00:04:36.949> compelled<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.460> jump<00:04:37.789> back<00:04:37.909> in<00:04:38.090> there<00:04:38.240> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
feel compelled to jump back in there and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.879 
feel compelled to jump back in there and
beat<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.509> you<00:04:38.900> know<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.110> can<00:04:39.440> because<00:04:39.800> you

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
beat it you know you can because you

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.350 
beat it you know you can because you
know<00:04:40.009> the<00:04:40.129> game's<00:04:40.310> not<00:04:40.520> inhibiting<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.150> and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
know the game's not inhibiting you and

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.180 
know the game's not inhibiting you and
so<00:04:41.659> when<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:41.990> do<00:04:42.169> beat<00:04:42.409> it<00:04:42.560> you<00:04:42.919> get<00:04:43.069> this
