00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.970 

I<00:00:11.940> believe<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.200> right<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.559> believe

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.470 
I believe that you have right to believe
in<00:00:14.099> your<00:00:14.250> religious<00:00:14.639> belief<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.210> believe

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
in your religious belief but I believe

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.270 
in your religious belief but I believe
in<00:00:15.570> evolution

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.800 

I<00:00:24.160> also<00:00:25.160> believe<00:00:25.520> that<00:00:25.700> we<00:00:26.420> have<00:00:26.540> the<00:00:26.660> bully

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
I also believe that we have the bully

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.960 
I also believe that we have the bully
pulpit<00:00:27.290> in<00:00:27.590> Washington<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.430> that<00:00:28.520> means<00:00:28.760> that

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
pulpit in Washington and that means that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.810 
pulpit in Washington and that means that
if<00:00:29.090> we<00:00:29.120> had<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.660> domestic<00:00:30.170> agenda<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.070> that

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
if we had a domestic agenda and that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.180 
if we had a domestic agenda and that
we've<00:00:31.970> realized<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.750> we<00:00:33.350> are<00:00:33.470> far<00:00:33.680> behind<00:00:33.860> in

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
we've realized that we are far behind in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.750 
we've realized that we are far behind in
our<00:00:34.310> science<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.180> NIH<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.140> CDC<00:00:36.460> we'd<00:00:37.460> be<00:00:37.610> able

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
our science and NIH and CDC we'd be able

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.010 
our science and NIH and CDC we'd be able
to<00:00:38.090> attack<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.880> very<00:00:40.880> bad<00:00:41.120> disease<00:00:41.540> that's

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
to attack this very bad disease that's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.930 
to attack this very bad disease that's
attacking<00:00:42.410> us<00:00:44.170> we'd<00:00:45.170> be<00:00:45.200> able<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.559> attack<00:00:45.910> so<00:00:46.910> I

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
attacking us we'd be able to attack so I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.270 
attacking us we'd be able to attack so I
think<00:00:47.239> it's<00:00:47.540> about<00:00:47.660> domestic<00:00:48.129> priorities<00:00:49.129> and

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
think it's about domestic priorities and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.890 
think it's about domestic priorities and
I<00:00:49.340> think<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:49.700> need<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.910> get<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.150> CDC<00:00:50.660> working

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
I think we need to get the CDC working

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.780 
I think we need to get the CDC working
we<00:00:51.110> need<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.320> get<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.500> NIH<00:00:51.830> working<00:00:52.070> take<00:00:52.610> that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
we need to get the NIH working take that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.759 
we need to get the NIH working take that
money<00:00:52.940> from<00:00:53.090> Iraq<00:00:53.420> put<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:53.930> in<00:00:54.050> here<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.530> begin

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
money from Iraq put it in here and begin

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.229 
money from Iraq put it in here and begin
to<00:00:54.800> fight<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.250> disease<00:00:55.580> so<00:00:55.790> people<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:56.120> live

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239
