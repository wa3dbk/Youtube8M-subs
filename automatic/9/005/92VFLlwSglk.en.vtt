00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.110 

hey<00:00:02.220> Brian<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.780> your<00:00:04.380> hinge<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.250> took

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
hey Brian so this is your hinge I took

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.089 
hey Brian so this is your hinge I took
off<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.660> demo<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> have<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.950> Tom

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
off the demo that I have for the Tom

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.030 
off the demo that I have for the Tom
Davies<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.639> problem<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.710> there<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
Davies the problem is that there is a

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.560 
Davies the problem is that there is a
spring<00:00:11.670> mechanism<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:12.540> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
spring mechanism in here which is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.350 
spring mechanism in here which is
pulling<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.170> piece<00:00:13.410> inside<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.179> this

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
pulling this piece inside so that this

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
pulling this piece inside so that this
barrel<00:00:15.630> won't<00:00:15.900> come<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.160> try<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
barrel won't come out so when you try to

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.290 
barrel won't come out so when you try to
put<00:00:17.550> them<00:00:17.640> together<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.820> barrels<00:00:21.119> don't

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
put them together the barrels don't

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.269 
put them together the barrels don't
totally<00:00:21.570> line<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> smooth<00:00:22.619> hole<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
totally line up for a smooth hole you

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.920 
totally line up for a smooth hole you
see<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.609> kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:23.910> an<00:00:24.090> oval<00:00:24.420> shape<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
see it's kind of like an oval shape so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
see it's kind of like an oval shape so
it<00:00:25.080> doesn't<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:25.740> align<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> complete

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
it doesn't really align for a complete

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.920 
it doesn't really align for a complete
hole<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.029> can't<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.570> screw<00:00:27.810> in

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hole so you can't get that screw in

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.530 
hole so you can't get that screw in
there<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.920> kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.400> simple<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.849> fix<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.020 

going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> pull<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.050> piece<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.280> then

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
going to pull this piece out and then

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
going to pull this piece out and then
stick<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.750> piece<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> paperclip<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
stick this piece of a paperclip that I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
stick this piece of a paperclip that I
just<00:00:38.219> snipped<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> jam

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
just snipped off of here in there to jam

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.740 
just snipped off of here in there to jam
it<00:00:40.350> open<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.309> align<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> two<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it open so we can align the two and the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.180 
it open so we can align the two and the
easiest<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:43.920> made<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
easiest way to do that is I just made a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.319 
easiest way to do that is I just made a
little<00:00:44.430> hook<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:49.910> put<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> through<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
little hook there put it through the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.910 
little hook there put it through the
barrel<00:00:51.570> hole<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.930 

now<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> notice<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> can

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.090 

bend<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.690> like<00:01:01.720> that<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.410> pull<00:01:02.590> that<00:01:02.739> piece<00:01:02.920> out

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
bend it like that to pull that piece out

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.510 
bend it like that to pull that piece out
you<00:01:03.370> see<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.579> gap<00:01:03.820> that's<00:01:04.059> opening<00:01:04.390> up<00:01:04.480> there

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
you see the gap that's opening up there

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.940 
you see the gap that's opening up there
that<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:07.330> where<00:01:08.200> you're<00:01:08.350> going<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.560> stick<00:01:08.770> this

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
that is where you're going to stick this

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.580 
that is where you're going to stick this
piece<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:13.570> force<00:01:13.870> that<00:01:14.220> open<00:01:16.590> stick

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
piece so there you force that open stick

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.719 
piece so there you force that open stick
that<00:01:17.740> right<00:01:17.800> in<00:01:18.100> there<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:24.130> it's<00:01:24.369> stuck<00:01:24.550> in

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
that right in there now it's stuck in

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
that right in there now it's stuck in
there<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:27.009> piece<00:01:27.220> has<00:01:27.369> been<00:01:27.400> forced<00:01:27.850> out

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.070 

now<00:01:32.470> you<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:33.009> align<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.399> two<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.840> can

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
now you can align the two and you can

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.230 
now you can align the two and you can
get<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.229> total<00:01:35.440> perfect<00:01:36.009> hole<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.850> into<00:01:40.000> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
get a total perfect hole and into that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.400 
get a total perfect hole and into that
hole<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.690> where<00:01:40.869> you're<00:01:40.990> going<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.170> drop<00:01:41.350> your

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
hole is where you're going to drop your

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.200 
hole is where you're going to drop your
screw<00:01:42.190> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.750> handy<00:01:44.020> tweezers<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:45.210> but

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
screw I have handy tweezers for that but

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.100 
screw I have handy tweezers for that but
you<00:01:46.420> can<00:01:46.570> do<00:01:47.350> with<00:01:47.530> fingers<00:01:47.890> because<00:01:48.160> luckily

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you can do with fingers because luckily

00:01:49.110 --> 00:02:01.500 
you can do with fingers because luckily
that<00:01:50.110> joint<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.530> pretty<00:01:50.770> clear

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.530 

and<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.430> screws<00:02:03.430> right<00:02:03.730> in<00:02:03.970> with<00:02:04.150> no

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
and I just screws right in with no

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.859 
and I just screws right in with no
resistance<00:02:05.260> at<00:02:05.650> all<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.300> then<00:02:10.450> when<00:02:10.600> it's<00:02:10.720> done

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
resistance at all so then when it's done

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.360 
resistance at all so then when it's done
now<00:02:11.230> you'll<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.530> kind<00:02:11.710> of<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.040> floppy

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
now you'll have kind of like a floppy

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.820 
now you'll have kind of like a floppy
temple<00:02:13.110> until<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.350> pull<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.650> piece

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
temple until you just pull this piece

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.450 
temple until you just pull this piece
out<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.340> see<00:02:18.490> totally<00:02:18.850> back<00:02:19.000> together

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
out now you see totally back together

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.380 
out now you see totally back together
spring<00:02:21.460> hinge<00:02:21.610> functioning<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.210> every

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
spring hinge functioning and every

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.230 
spring hinge functioning and every
that's<00:02:22.690> all<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.080> takes
