00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
would also use muskets where they put

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.139 
would also use muskets where they put
the<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:34.020> tinder<00:00:34.710> into<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> pan<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
sparks light the tinder

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.740 
sparks light the tinder
so<00:00:40.829> yeah<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.820> relied<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.120> flint<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.660> steel

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so yeah they relied on flint and steel

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
so yeah they relied on flint and steel
and<00:00:45.260> when<00:00:46.260> people<00:00:46.590> use<00:00:48.559> flint<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> steel<00:00:49.800> they

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and when people use flint and steel they

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
and when people use flint and steel they
assumed<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> char<00:00:51.210> cloth<00:00:51.300> was<00:00:51.629> used<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
assumed that char cloth was used but and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.819 
assumed that char cloth was used but and
char<00:00:53.280> cloth<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.320> used<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
char cloth is not it was used in the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
char cloth is not it was used in the
18th<00:00:56.129> century<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.699> lighting<00:00:57.030> fires<00:00:57.300> but

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
18th century for lighting fires but

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.110 
18th century for lighting fires but
mainly<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.199> cities<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.730> only<00:00:59.850> be

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
mainly in cities and that would only be

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110 
mainly in cities and that would only be
made<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.840> rags<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.309> were<00:01:02.430> no

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
made with rags you know that were no

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.170 
made with rags you know that were no
other<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.870> anything<00:01:04.880> obviously<00:01:05.880> cloth

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
other use for anything obviously cloth

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
other use for anything obviously cloth
would<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.510> been<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.960> more<00:01:07.110> valuable<00:01:07.530> back

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
would have been a lot more valuable back

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
would have been a lot more valuable back
then<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.080> just

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
then so before it was you know just

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
then so before it was you know just
burnt<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.040> used<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> start<00:01:11.549> fires<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.090> would

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
burnt to be used to start fires it would

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
burnt to be used to start fires it would
have<00:01:12.299> been<00:01:12.420> used<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.900> anything<00:01:13.530> else

possible especially woodsmen even if

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.730 
possible especially woodsmen even if
they<00:01:17.909> did<00:01:18.119> take<00:01:18.299> char<00:01:18.570> cloth<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.590> gonna

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
stuffed so they had to char all the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.359 
stuffed so they had to char all the
materials<00:01:24.930> when<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.170> were<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.770> the

materials when they were out on the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
materials when they were out on the
trail<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.869> know<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.290> able<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
trail you know that would be able to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
trail you know that would be able to
take<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> spark<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.430> mainly<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:29.939> plant

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
take a spark so they mainly use plant

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.080 
take a spark so they mainly use plant
tenders<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.340> things<00:01:32.790> such<00:01:33.060> as

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
tenders and you know things such as

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.200 
tenders and you know things such as
chowder<00:01:33.630> fungus

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
chowder fungus

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
chowder fungus
so<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.590> period-correct

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so that's period-correct

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.179 
so that's period-correct
clinton<00:01:39.060> steel<00:01:39.329> fire<00:01:39.630> lighting<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.950> no

guys<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.479> about<00:02:00.570> 18th<00:02:01.020> century

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
guys so think about 18th century

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.740 
guys so think about 18th century
charring<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.579> would<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.850> had<00:02:02.969> tinderboxes

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
charring they would have had tinderboxes

charring they would have had tinderboxes
so<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.979> imagine<00:02:05.399> no<00:02:05.759> standard<00:02:06.509> tin

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
so you can imagine no standard tin

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.040 
so you can imagine no standard tin
fingers<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.729> wouldn't<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.149> pierced<00:02:09.929> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
fingers they wouldn't have pierced a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.229 
fingers they wouldn't have pierced a
hole<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.190> char<00:02:11.430> something<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
hole in it just to char something the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.339 
hole in it just to char something the
idea<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> tinderbox

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
idea of the tinderbox

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
idea of the tinderbox
obviously

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
obviously

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
obviously
keep<00:02:14.010> tinder-dry<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.480> they're<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.840> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
keep tinder-dry so they're not going to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.010 
keep tinder-dry so they're not going to

compromise such a valuable item just to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.810 
compromise such a valuable item just to
char<00:02:19.260> something<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.810> traditional<00:02:22.320> way<00:02:22.380> of

let's<00:02:59.830> get<00:02:59.950> another<00:03:06.269> seal<00:03:07.269> like<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.510> said<00:03:07.720> this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
let's get another seal like I said this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.309 
let's get another seal like I said this
was<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.110> main<00:03:08.410> way<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:09.030> charring<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
was the main way of charring the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.360 
was the main way of charring the
material<00:03:11.319> back<00:03:11.440> then<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.190> know<00:03:12.220> you

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
material back then and you know you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.880 
material back then and you know you
don't<00:03:12.580> have<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.030> pierce<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.140> tinder<00:03:14.530> box<00:03:14.650> or

don't have to pierce your tinder box or
anything<00:03:15.870> right<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.260> charred<00:03:17.560> there<00:03:17.799> you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
anything right so it's charred there you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.150 
anything right so it's charred there you
can<00:03:18.099> see<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> what<00:03:20.049> they're<00:03:20.230> next<00:03:20.620> what<00:03:21.069> they

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
can see so what they're next what they

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.910 
can see so what they're next what they
do<00:03:21.220> next<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.870> they'd<00:03:23.080> get<00:03:23.290> their<00:03:23.440> tinder<00:03:23.769> box

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
do next is they'd get their tinder box

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.949 
do next is they'd get their tinder box
that<00:03:24.549> hasn't<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> hole<00:03:25.330> in<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:30.810> put<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
that hasn't got a hole in it put the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.280 
that hasn't got a hole in it put the
charred<00:03:32.260> material<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.099> there<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.049> then<00:03:35.049> close

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
charred material in there and then close

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.039 
charred material in there and then close
the<00:03:35.319> lid<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:36.400> block<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.819> oxygen<00:03:37.299> and<00:03:37.510> you

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
the lid just to block the oxygen and you

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.430 
the lid just to block the oxygen and you
know<00:03:39.090> extinguish<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.450> charred<00:03:40.720> material

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.990 

another<00:03:44.440> way<00:03:44.650> of<00:03:44.769> doing<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:45.790> they

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
another way of doing it is if they

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.380 
another way of doing it is if they
didn't<00:03:46.180> have<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.329> tinder<00:03:46.660> box<00:03:48.209> which<00:03:49.209> is

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
didn't have a tinder box which is

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.600 
didn't have a tinder box which is
unlikely<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.170> another<00:03:50.620> thing<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:50.980> can<00:03:51.190> do<00:03:51.430> is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
unlikely but another thing you can do is

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.000 
unlikely but another thing you can do is
dig<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.269> small<00:03:52.450> hole<00:03:52.599> in<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.140> earth<00:03:53.200> you<00:03:53.890> know

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
dig a small hole in the earth you know

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.250 
dig a small hole in the earth you know
put<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:54.370> charred<00:03:54.670> material<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.299> then<00:03:55.510> bury

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
put your charred material in then bury

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.610 
put your charred material in then bury
it<00:03:56.380> over<00:03:56.769> again<00:03:57.069> just<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.549> block<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.940> oxygen

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
it over again just to block the oxygen

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.009 
it over again just to block the oxygen
alright<00:03:59.620> so<00:03:59.799> here<00:04:00.010> we<00:04:00.040> go<00:04:00.160> oh<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.690> charred
