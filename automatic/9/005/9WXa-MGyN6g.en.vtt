00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.660
 I connect you the usb key to your 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.329
 computer and then that's where I 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.790
 start so you open horizon this is 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 already done and you press here and varied 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.969
 with the aspects that appears to choose and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.710
 game boy game profile to me I took 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.860
 a profile that has no live it was 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 just for the video you click on it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.820
 and white musicians I tell myself it's 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.820
 well summer 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.430

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.250
 profile edit ah I hold well that's all 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.160
 that there was version 2.0 not 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.510
 works more so click on 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.510
 the appetite it steals bbox open 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.329
 euros 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.640
 poor and the publisher had not benefited 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.690
 the profile open now so now 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.460
 they must display your your not 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.979
 too with this will not necessarily be big 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:52.450
 so here you are going to have your 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:54.070
 gamerscore so the success and he goes 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.149
 show all the games you're playing 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.440
 have played so for example I'm going 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:08.020
 take pay 2 is so there you see the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:13.900
 local boss a few which he has zero 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.320
 success so yeah if for example you 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.050
 want to pick up in unravel that 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.090
 click on the one you want and there 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.340
 so you look at yourself if its marks 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.970
 and online the you the developer 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.670
 online but if it's not marked all 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.049
 in one the council of france line 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 like that you do not need to do 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.830
 the date 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.600
 so that's done offline 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.840
 in fact it's an offline locate 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.840
 well that's good 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.159
 then for example you want 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.290
 unlock all hits at once so 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.459
 it's precious 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.480
 understand that I play it only to you 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.349
 want by christ king and you do 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.540
 a rag hall of light 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.099
 you are told to be careful because he 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.420
 worth all this last flying blue 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.090
 it's because of what I told you 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:26.030
 that I flatter myself the fact yes which one 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.090
 offline online ok so this is the case 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.459
 all zeros may not be me 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.900
 prick I was on the game and their 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:39.790
 able to judge on the budget so that's 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.139
 good as we can see I went from 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.139
 195 to 1605 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:55.910
 I want to cremate something that this 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:04:00.859
 mode to give you the stats to 0 so 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.900
 I advise you I advise you any 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.220
 just 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:12.900
 to do it by maximum 5000 g per day 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.280
 so here you have unlocked 2.3 you 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.760
 unlock two or three complete games 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.280
 we are about and then after you 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.490
 you are and you start the next day 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.940
 because after towards the ten thousand and a thousand 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.100
 like that the xbox live notices it and 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.420
 you ben ali finally they are not going there 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.440
 will reset successes and all 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.110
 which has been moderated at most 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.980

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.780
