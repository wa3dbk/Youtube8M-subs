the legacy here when you mash it mat it
it's<00:03:48.890> going<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.100> go<00:03:49.220> up<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.430> about<00:03:49.490> 5,500<00:03:50.360> rpms

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
stay there just stays there that's the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.210 
stay there just stays there that's the
weird<00:03:53.600> thing<00:03:53.690> about<00:03:53.960> the<00:03:54.080> CVT<00:03:54.470> there's<00:03:55.070> no

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
weird thing about the CVT there's no

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.670 
weird thing about the CVT there's no
shifting<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:56.330> just<00:03:56.540> stays<00:03:56.840> there<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.410> your

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
shifting it just stays there and your

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.880 
shifting it just stays there and your
speed<00:03:57.890> climbs<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.960> knows<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.230> you<00:04:00.650> want

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
speed climbs so it knows that you want

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830 
speed climbs so it knows that you want
maximum<00:04:01.640> torque<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.090> horsepower<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.750> it

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
maximum torque and horsepower so it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.590 
maximum torque and horsepower so it
gives<00:04:03.020> it<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.320> you<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.970> then<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:06.580> just<00:04:07.600> get

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
gives it to you and then you just get

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.860 
gives it to you and then you just get
what<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.840> want<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.680> depending<00:04:10.220> on<00:04:10.340> where<00:04:10.550> your

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
what you want so depending on where your

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.660 
what you want so depending on where your

where<00:04:14.060> you're<00:04:14.270> going<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:15.489> get<00:04:16.489> your<00:04:16.670> reps<00:04:17.620> so

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
where you're going to get your reps so

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.410 
where you're going to get your reps so
if<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.859> want<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.130> save<00:04:19.340> gas<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:20.000> just<00:04:20.209> stay

light on the puddle it'll get there

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.670 
light on the puddle it'll get there
you'll<00:04:22.310> eventually<00:04:22.520> get<00:04:22.850> up<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.120> speed<00:04:23.680> you'll

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
you'll eventually get up to speed you'll

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.580 
you'll eventually get up to speed you'll
never<00:04:24.920> go<00:04:25.130> over<00:04:25.160> tree<00:04:25.580> grain<00:04:26.170> but<00:04:27.170> if<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.410> want

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.170 
never go over tree grain but if you want
to<00:04:27.710> get<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.920> Reds<00:04:28.130> up<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.730> can<00:04:28.880> get<00:04:28.970> some

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
to get the Reds up so you can get some

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.640 
to get the Reds up so you can get some
power<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.630> get<00:04:29.780> out<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.110> corner<00:04:30.500> or

power to get out of a corner or

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.070 
power to get out of a corner or
something

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
something

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.279 
something
they<00:04:33.009> will<00:04:33.250> give<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.940> but<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.080> any

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
they will give it to you but like any

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.200 
they will give it to you but like any
automatic<00:04:36.220> transmission<00:04:36.849> you<00:04:36.970> gotta

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
automatic transmission you gotta

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.180 
automatic transmission you gotta
anticipate<00:04:37.930> when<00:04:38.650> you're<00:04:38.800> going<00:04:38.949> to<00:04:39.009> want

anticipate when you're going to want

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.589 
anticipate when you're going to want
that<00:04:39.370> power<00:04:39.639> because<00:04:39.849> there<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.210> some<00:04:40.389> lag

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
that power because there is some lag

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.920 
that power because there is some lag
sort<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.650> like<00:04:41.770> turbo<00:04:42.129> lag<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:43.449> know<00:04:43.599> if<00:04:43.810> I

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
sort of like turbo lag you know if I

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.050 
sort of like turbo lag you know if I
want<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.289> come<00:04:44.860> out<00:04:45.009> of<00:04:45.039> this<00:04:45.250> corner<00:04:45.729> at<00:04:45.940> a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
want to come out of this corner at a

want to come out of this corner at a
high<00:04:46.180> rate<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.419> speed<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.720> got<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> mash<00:04:47.319> it<00:04:47.530> now

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.070 

not<00:04:50.830> when<00:04:51.819> I<00:04:51.879> actually<00:04:52.120> need<00:04:52.569> it<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:52.870> right

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
not when I actually need it like right

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.659 
not when I actually need it like right
now<00:04:53.259> I<00:04:53.289> don't<00:04:53.470> really<00:04:53.770> want<00:04:54.069> the<00:04:54.190> power<00:04:54.400> now

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
now I don't really want the power now

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.230 
now I don't really want the power now
but<00:04:55.509> this<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:57.430> when<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.789> would<00:04:57.879> manage<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
but this is when you would manage the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.980 
but this is when you would manage the
cuddle<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.349> if<00:04:59.560> you<00:04:59.650> brake<00:05:00.780> you're<00:05:01.780> going<00:05:01.930> to

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
cuddle and if you brake you're going to

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.330 
cuddle and if you brake you're going to
definitely<00:05:02.110> want<00:05:02.409> to<00:05:02.560> manage<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.949> toggle<00:05:03.280> to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
definitely want to manage the toggle to

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.480 
definitely want to manage the toggle to
keep<00:05:03.520> your<00:05:03.639> speed<00:05:03.879> up<00:05:04.919> you'd<00:05:05.919> be<00:05:05.949> a<00:05:06.099> bit<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.400> a

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
keep your speed up you'd be a bit of a
