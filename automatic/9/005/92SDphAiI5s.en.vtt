a pre-rendered movie then there's always
going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:37.960> speculation<00:02:38.380> about<00:02:38.650> well<00:02:38.860> yeah

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
going to be speculation about well yeah

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.230 
going to be speculation about well yeah
sure<00:02:39.280> your<00:02:39.460> engines<00:02:39.730> not<00:02:39.820> gonna<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.030> able<00:02:40.090> to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
sure your engines not gonna be able to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.030 
sure your engines not gonna be able to
do<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.410> think<00:02:41.440> what<00:02:41.650> we're<00:02:41.770> trying<00:02:41.890> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
do that and I think what we're trying to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.460 
do that and I think what we're trying to
show<00:02:42.220> firmly<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.300> orange<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.290> do

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
show firmly is that orange and can do

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.570 
show firmly is that orange and can do
the<00:02:44.590> stuff<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:44.980> say<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.460> do

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
the stuff that we say it's going to do

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.690 
the stuff that we say it's going to do
and<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:45.820> doing<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.150> right<00:02:46.300> now<00:02:47.460> what<00:02:48.460> we're

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and I'm doing it right now what we're

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.150 
and I'm doing it right now what we're
building<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.630> our<00:02:49.990> bar<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.710> where<00:02:50.920> we're

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
building here is our bar for where we're

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.680 
building here is our bar for where we're
going<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.370> shoot<00:02:51.580> for<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:52.180> real<00:02:52.510> gameplay<00:02:54.690> it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
going to shoot for in real gameplay it's

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.900 
going to shoot for in real gameplay it's
great<00:02:55.990> there's<00:02:56.200> 90<00:02:56.560> guys<00:02:56.740> here<00:02:57.100> half<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.820> them

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
great there's 90 guys here half of them

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.790 
great there's 90 guys here half of them
are<00:02:58.060> artists<00:02:58.450> half<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.080> them<00:02:59.140> are<00:02:59.320> engineers

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
are artists half of them are engineers

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.640 
are artists half of them are engineers
and<00:03:00.490> it's<00:03:00.670> like<00:03:00.850> oil<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.270> water<00:03:01.360> all<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> left

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and it's like oil and water all the left

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.110 
and it's like oil and water all the left
brain<00:03:02.830> people<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.640> right<00:03:03.820> bring

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
brain people and all the right bring

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.120 
brain people and all the right bring
people<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.690> both<00:03:05.170> groups<00:03:05.530> think<00:03:05.860> that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
people and both groups think that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.060 
people and both groups think that
they're<00:03:06.640> really<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.120> people<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.510> charge

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
they're really the people in charge

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.260 
they're really the people in charge
apparently<00:03:09.070> engineering<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.970> quite

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
apparently engineering is quite

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.150 
apparently engineering is quite
important<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:11.230> right<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.620> course<00:03:11.830> it's<00:03:12.070> a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
important all right so of course it's a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.060 
important all right so of course it's a
science<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.420> draw<00:03:13.600> pretty<00:03:13.840> pictures

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.010 

so<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.100> get<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.670> do<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.209> suppose<00:03:19.600> it's<00:03:19.959> all

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
so I get to do that I suppose it's all

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.270 
so I get to do that I suppose it's all
about<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.320> lighting<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.800> all<00:03:20.890> about<00:03:21.070> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
about the lighting it's all about the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.949 
about the lighting it's all about the
you<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.910> additional<00:03:22.209> detail<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.780> bump

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
you know the additional detail the bump

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.330 
you know the additional detail the bump
mapping<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:23.890> remember<00:03:24.010> all<00:03:24.220> their

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
mapping and I can remember all their

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.280 
mapping and I can remember all their
terminologies<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.209> Buddha<00:03:25.870> hada<00:03:26.050> and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
terminologies and the Buddha hada and

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.900 
terminologies and the Buddha hada and
the<00:03:26.350> triple<00:03:26.680> specular<00:03:27.100> shields<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:27.820> on

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
the triple specular shields and so on

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.870 
the triple specular shields and so on
and<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.030> forth<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.720> Halo<00:03:28.959> 3<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.680> have<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.760> know

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and so forth in Halo 3 you have you know

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.210 
and so forth in Halo 3 you have you know
like<00:03:31.030> entire<00:03:31.450> dynamic<00:03:31.720> range<00:03:32.170> available<00:03:32.530> for

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
like entire dynamic range available for

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.800 
like entire dynamic range available for
you<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:33.610> know<00:03:33.880> things<00:03:34.120> are<00:03:34.300> bright<00:03:34.570> are

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
you so you know things are bright are

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.030 
you so you know things are bright are
bright<00:03:35.080> things<00:03:35.380> are<00:03:35.530> normal

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
bright things are normal

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.250 
bright things are normal
you<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.579> whole<00:03:36.790> contrast<00:03:37.360> there<00:03:37.629> for

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
you have the whole contrast there for

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.559 
you have the whole contrast there for
example<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.739> sky<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.700> new<00:03:39.909> way<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.120> doing

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
example the sky it's a new way of doing

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.459 
example the sky it's a new way of doing
our<00:03:40.810> sky<00:03:41.079> like<00:03:41.469> from<00:03:41.829> halo<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:43.140> every<00:03:44.140> now<00:03:44.260> and

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
our sky like from halo to every now and

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.649 
our sky like from halo to every now and
then<00:03:44.590> it'll<00:03:45.099> catch<00:03:45.400> my<00:03:45.609> eye<00:03:45.640> still<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.359> then

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
then it'll catch my eye still and then

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.160 
then it'll catch my eye still and then
realizing<00:03:47.230> wow<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:48.359> can't<00:03:49.359> believe<00:03:49.390> we're<00:03:49.959> able

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
realizing wow I can't believe we're able

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.009 
realizing wow I can't believe we're able
to<00:03:50.319> pull<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.620> long<00:03:51.689> for<00:03:52.689> the<00:03:52.810> announcement

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
to pull that long for the announcement

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.309 
to pull that long for the announcement
it's<00:03:53.829> gone<00:03:54.010> really<00:03:54.189> well<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:55.480> hasn't<00:03:55.870> been<00:03:55.900> as

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
it's gone really well it hasn't been as

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.300 
it's gone really well it hasn't been as
much<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.750> know<00:03:58.840> monkey<00:03:59.409> fight<00:03:59.620> as

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
much of a you know monkey fight as

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.300 
much of a you know monkey fight as
it<00:04:00.519> could<00:04:00.700> have<00:04:00.790> been<00:04:00.909> pund<00:04:01.420> would<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:02.310> people

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
it could have been pund would be people

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.009 
it could have been pund would be people
make<00:04:03.459> decisions<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.909> affect<00:04:04.420> us<00:04:04.569> that<00:04:04.810> and

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
make decisions that affect us that and

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.660 
make decisions that affect us that and
they<00:04:05.139> don't<00:04:05.260> really<00:04:05.799> worry<00:04:06.069> about<00:04:06.159> it<00:04:06.430> my

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
they don't really worry about it my

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.830 
they don't really worry about it my
God's<00:04:06.879> alright<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.299> sound<00:04:07.480> guys<00:04:07.599> will<00:04:07.719> figure

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
God's alright the sound guys will figure

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.990 
God's alright the sound guys will figure
it<00:04:07.989> out<00:04:08.049> at<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:08.200> end<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.439> chain<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.849> we<00:04:09.849> do

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
it out at the end of the chain and we do

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.210 
it out at the end of the chain and we do
always<00:04:10.480> sometimes<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.319> feels<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.620> little<00:04:11.769> like

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
always sometimes it feels a little like

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.849 
always sometimes it feels a little like
you<00:04:12.310> got<00:04:12.459> shat<00:04:12.700> on<00:04:12.730> few<00:04:13.450> too<00:04:13.540> many<00:04:13.569> times

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
you got shat on few too many times

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.839 
you got shat on few too many times
everyone<00:04:14.859> else<00:04:15.069> is<00:04:16.530> prolonging<00:04:17.530> my<00:04:17.949> part<00:04:18.729> of

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
everyone else is prolonging my part of

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.670 
everyone else is prolonging my part of
the<00:04:18.910> job<00:04:19.150> I'm<00:04:19.690> actually<00:04:19.989> just<00:04:20.229> making<00:04:20.590> it

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
the job I'm actually just making it

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.540
