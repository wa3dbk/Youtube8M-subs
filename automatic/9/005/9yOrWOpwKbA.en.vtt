00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.089 
much of this game for me is realigning
myself<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.510> shakes<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.650> feels<00:02:27.860> very

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
myself with the shakes so it feels very

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.220 
myself with the shakes so it feels very
weird<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.209> point<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.750> I'm<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.079> gonna

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
weird at this point and I'm just gonna

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.490 
weird at this point and I'm just gonna
jump<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:31.040> probably<00:02:31.880> wasn't<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> good<00:02:32.150> idea

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
jump that probably wasn't a good idea

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.930 
jump that probably wasn't a good idea
just<00:02:33.500> gonna<00:02:33.650> leave<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.920> blue<00:02:34.129> ones<00:02:34.310> up<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.610> boil

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
just gonna leave the blue ones up a boil

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.259 
just gonna leave the blue ones up a boil
time<00:02:35.690> no<00:02:35.930> no<00:02:36.200> no<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.829> can<00:02:36.980> go<00:02:37.160> forward<00:02:37.549> off

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.229 

this<00:02:41.269> is<00:02:41.480> actually<00:02:42.019> um<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.709> doesn't<00:02:43.250> work<00:02:43.849> hard

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
this is actually um it doesn't work hard

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.210 
this is actually um it doesn't work hard
because<00:02:45.110> uh<00:02:45.319> because<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:48.049> guys<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.500> think<00:02:49.099> I

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
because uh because you guys I think I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.520 
because uh because you guys I think I
was<00:02:49.549> hearing<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:50.000> afraid<00:02:50.840> who<00:02:50.989> said<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.319> but

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
was hearing on afraid who said this but

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.229 
was hearing on afraid who said this but
if<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.829> can't<00:02:52.099> feel<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> control<00:02:52.849> you<00:02:53.030> can't

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
if you can't feel the control you can't

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.660 
if you can't feel the control you can't
really<00:02:53.420> understand<00:02:54.049> them<00:02:54.319> why<00:02:55.190> something<00:02:55.579> is

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
really understand them why something is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.979 
really understand them why something is
hard<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.180> think<00:02:56.359> this<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.540> one<00:02:56.780> case<00:02:56.930> where

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
hard and I think this is one case where

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.020 
hard and I think this is one case where
it<00:02:57.230> definitely<00:02:57.560> applies<00:02:57.799> like<00:02:58.100> just<00:02:58.940> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it definitely applies like just the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.120 
it definitely applies like just the
jumping<00:02:59.389> it<00:02:59.480> feels<00:02:59.660> very<00:02:59.930> weird<00:03:00.829> without

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
jumping it feels very weird without

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.190 
jumping it feels very weird without
using<00:03:01.639> the<00:03:01.850> shake<00:03:02.030> ability<00:03:02.389> that's<00:03:02.569> ok<00:03:02.959> that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
using the shake ability that's ok that's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.259 
using the shake ability that's ok that's
a<00:03:03.290> pastilla<00:03:04.450> um<00:03:06.099> if<00:03:07.099> definitely<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.880> just<00:03:08.090> it

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
a pastilla um if definitely it just it

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.030 
a pastilla um if definitely it just it
