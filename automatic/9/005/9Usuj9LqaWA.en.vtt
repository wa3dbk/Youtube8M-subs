00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
it was not just about the action which I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.070

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.270 
it also had to do with character
development<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.740> just<00:02:25.740> about<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> human

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
development and just about the human

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.820 
development and just about the human
spirit<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.760> how<00:02:27.360> strong<00:02:27.660> humanity<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.590> is

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
