00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 welcome, welcome to the channel 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.290
 light graf 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.360
 My name is Felipe and this is ours. 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 first video I'll're showing 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.500
 How do you import photos? 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.940
 to light on in two ways 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.070
 importing from your card 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.150
 memory card or 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 importing photos that are already on the disc 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.160
 so I was there and light on the one that is 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.179
 his home screen if you make your 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 installation 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.620
 you will come across this screen here and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.690
 I'll click here and import when 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 I do this my camera is already 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 connected in the usb it already recognizes it and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.289
 already uploads the photos that are in there 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 Card're seeing here 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.780
 She is showing you how to do it. 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.520
 this import from the camera 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 first 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 then he has already loaded those three 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.379
 photos that I have a card and then I 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 I have option here already in importing 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.600
 take a photo or another that is not the case 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 that it was important three and a resource that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.409
 I find it interesting that at the time of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 import this here o rename file 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.240
 what is it here during the copy of the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.100
 the memory card file to your 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.340
 computer will apply this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 name because the pronoun you want 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 that already has some some pre 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 defined but I will not use the strike 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.759
 I will not edit paying here and here I 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.689
 I like an additional pronoun 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.549
 My picture 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.630
 the first thing I like about 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:54.570
 add is the year the year followed by the month 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 followed by the day and hour in a minute 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.530
 here I already have a default a date that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.430
 it is always growing 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.969
 check in online and say in a few 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.520
 What is the Catalan word for 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.629
 for example a wedding by marriage 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 from a customer 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.830
 you put that wedding name on 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.440
 customer 15 years 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:26.790
 A big touch I'm going to import 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:30.050
 video and here is the last attribute that 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.320
 I like to add is the sequence 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.240
 it would be here that sequence to each photo 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.360
 imported will be added plus one 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.100
 in the first 12 in the second and three in the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.390
 third and so on complete 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.920
 He already gave here 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.020
 a sample of how the name of the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.050
 file marked pc here and something else 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.560
 that I like to do is always matter 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.100
 the memory card photo to a 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.090
 centralized place on your computer 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.300
 here i have a hard disk here 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.660
 of a land that I use for this 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.300
 that his name is with 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.050
 paste all the photos I care 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.620
 independent about what you want to come here 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.030
 he organizes who by date is and the photos 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.120
 will be played here 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.209
 here it will stay centralized cities 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.540
 and in the future I want to copy make a 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.280
 backup the photos just save this page 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:42.209
 and as here it contains all the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.100
 click here to import when I 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.280
 do this it copies there from my 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.209
 memory and will play here in the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.459
 my catalog 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.860
 he could not eject he could connect 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.680
 by usb 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.790
 so here I have my three photos 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.410
 which is important from my card 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.570
 memory with the one that was the way 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.810
 number 1 that most people use 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.290
 I wanted a new catalog is always good 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.900
 create a catalog by wedding subject 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.650
 this customer's plan 15 years name 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.140
 client 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.580
 so when you want, just open it 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.810
 that catalog to make the treatment 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.450
 of photos 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 there is no other way to 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.500
 to import here is John for 33 from 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.440
 from my camera 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.910
 to import again and here I no longer 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.030
 I choose my camera more 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.730
 I'll say another origin and here I've separated 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.640
 graf luddy great 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.190
 separate sharing photos here 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.710
 my own unity for what he 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.570
 brought here 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.880
 He brought me these photos that are 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.830
 13 with his pasta 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.520
 and here is the same thing I can 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.530
 unmark a photo that I do not want by 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.440
 example 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.520
 and here is the difference here is to follow 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.680
 what already changed 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.390
 he has already put here a unit that is 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.970
 Where is the origin of the photo? 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.490
 and here I have the option to copy the photo 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.500
 then we fell that same question 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.350
 previous I'll copy 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.669
 only here as the origin is mine 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.470
 own hd 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.630
 If I clicked copy I went back to the photo 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.940
 in two different places 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.070
 I will generate duplicity, I can 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.340
 use the move option that it will take 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.310
 photo here of this folder and will play here 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.760
 that my passion and I can with 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.700
 add when I have to add the 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.600
 the photo will be added to the 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.700
 catalog 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.070
 but she will continue there on the spot 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.729
 and the catalog will create only the 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.160
 a reference to this file here I 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.850
 use this option add do not want 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.360
 copying a property in the photo may 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.330
 Note that when you speak you use the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.760
 adding you do not have the 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.460
 rename why the picture will stay 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.500
 there in the original place it has no way 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.450
 Are you making any kind of 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.270
 modification it will only point to this 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:19.600
 folder that in case the graf light 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:23.740
 catalog photos click on import 12 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.870
 because I unselected one of them here 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.570
 if you observe he created this ticket 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.820
 tock previous import that's that 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.790
 It's an import I just made. 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.650
 my last import were 12 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.320
 photos and here 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.849
 all the photos that are my last 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.279
 import but the 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.899
 the one that already had in the case were three 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.389
 photos that I cared about 

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:47.919
 memory so if you want to know that 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.599
 you matter last 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.599
 just click here on previous quotation 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.080
 One last tip here is to press the 

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:59.309
 tab 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.990
 When you do this the sellers are 

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:04.569
 he hides to you here 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.969
 2 - sides you pass the mouse shows 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:11.139
 but he hides it in order to facilitate his 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:15.249
 images of a 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.529
 another feature here you can increase the 

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:22.959
 Thumbnail size also finds great 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:24.819
 or small size and that's it you 

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.809
 have these two ways you are creating your 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.809
 capital 

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:29.740
 There is no mystery, it's very simple. 

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:32.229
 that's personal 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.899
 the first video was much simpler 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:37.449
 to show you these two ways 

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:39.909
 photo of matter from the car 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.889
 from a folder on the disc or the part 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:45.369
 of the camera memory card 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:47.469
 And if you liked the video, give it a jewel. 

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:50.829
 leave an additional comment the 

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:53.919
 favoring the ability to grow and 

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:55.300
 Let's talk, I'd like to redo the 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.419
 other two videos 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.229
 leave your comments and feedback to the 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:01.229
 next staff
