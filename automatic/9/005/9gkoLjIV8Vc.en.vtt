00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 here in the background you can see the medium 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.420
 bridge this is the map we at 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.070
 last time I played and I have 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.660
 thought there again new submission 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.010
 got there is still old things 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 There are certainly also want to see 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.720
 there again today four maps the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 for election next time 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.899
 now comes the to be played 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 number one, the number one I give you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.309
 will present today is the number 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 two of the last time that is namely 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.559
 Gods miserable and the idol and only completely 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.870
 very close to the victory 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.819
 I've gotten past it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 decided today again good zealand 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.440
 to stand for election so if you want 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.899
 that the next let's play on this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210
 map terrain already knows the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.429
 I already at the last let's go cards 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 have shown choice if you want it 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.140
 that niessl sp takes place 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.610
 this map is waiting here with yours 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 Coming for the misery next show 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 I am your new home and that is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 also a new map that I hold and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.790
 and here it was 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 I have the map myself 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
 never seen before and I am whole 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.900
 curious what she expects so I see 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.980
 here on the left forest and that's also cool 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.510
 could this time mountains at many many and 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.520
 Here there is also the resource 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.070
 It's a bit like that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.780
 right edge position and a new one 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.540
 home sounds like after departure 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 sounds like something new to see and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 We definitely see that here as well 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.100
 here is namely slow this barren 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.900
 desert to a lush pasture yet 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.400
 there are players there too 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.420
 obviously after new filds 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.850
 look around too my goodness okay here 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.820
 but it also laid some very very very 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.770
 many wolves guard these relics 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.570
 There is also a starting point here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.420
 unlike you here the whole 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.100
 different 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.600
 against which you have combined with each other 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.890
 here, for example, it is getting white 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.910
 me where we still in the west the desert 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.090
 is here in the east ice at the start and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.520
 that's not too short we see one here 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.750
 coniferous snowy and here at the very 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.150
 the end, so to speak, the contact with the deserts 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.459
 Settlement in the west is located here 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 a little folks at one 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.330
 mountain brook in the middle of ice very cool so 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.590
 interesting web in any case also like 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.930
 I think about it now 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.370
 You can playable without end man 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.800
 should not just chop wood what will happen 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.690
 but many wolves are otherwise synonymous for 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.050
 you to vote a new home 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.640
 Do you want that to be the next card? 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.620
 which we play together here 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.560
 let's play then wait with yours coming 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.750
 for a new home 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.780
 and that is the third map of today 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.110
 Every day she wears the sonorous one 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.690
 name battle on ice in white forest 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.959
 that sounds like a nice rhythm and 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.390
 in fact it is a 4 hediger tokios 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.040
 and who knows more about the verse and lyric 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.760
 I would like to know who can hof me 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.739
 speak to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.570
 In any case , that's an app for me 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.430
 me too very up to date 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.290
 has reached and we look what it is here 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.030
 In this white ball we see 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.000
 definitely see starting points here 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.370
 a team is obviously here on the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.470
 a side of the frozen river 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.810
 on the road and on the other side that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.030
 others also team up again 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.299
 only bridge this time only snowy 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.790
 this time with a completely frozen one 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.500
 river and also several accesses like 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.790
 can see here though there are two 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.340
 Year could also be here on the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.610
 middle center but much darker 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.110
 forest dark snowy forest on each 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.549
 also a very nice one 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.540
 interesting thing here we see too 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.400
 so the relics are also measured 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.329
 the proximity here are again so extra 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.579
 can be seen with individual raw materials 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.380
 very good could be very very good 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.139
 So balance will be on everyone 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.239
 if it is with the game strengthen the 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.040
 individual players also balanced 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.480
 was a very balanced 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.930
 could be the match so you could say that 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.270
 here you fight on ice in the white forest who 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.640
 Who wants to see this map wants 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.120
 should do it and we'll take a look 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.610
 last and fourth card 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.350
 and that's the end of it, too, I throw it again 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.160
 my hat in the ring 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.190
 you all have the first match on endor 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.150
 seen what tension and emotions 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.490
 absolutely impossible to beat at all 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.230
 and I also want this simple one 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.780
 but really, really 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.180
 interesting map hereby to vote 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.650
 so if you want my 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.870
 map endor the forest moon if this map 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.220
 also be back on the start if you 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.130
 want us to play this here then 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.990
 vote for the forest votet for endo you 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.360
 So you have four options again 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.210
 for election in this cold election 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.070
 So let's summarize number one 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.230
 would be very miserable number two would be one 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.540
 new home number three who butcher 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.020
 white in the white forest and number four is 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.470
 endor votet and we play the number 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.470
 one
