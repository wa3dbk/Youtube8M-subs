everything the way that you saw me doing
the<00:01:41.460> other<00:01:41.700> tutorials<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.180> take<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the other tutorials so if you take a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.499 
the other tutorials so if you take a
little<00:01:45.509> while<00:01:45.780> half<00:01:46.229> an<00:01:46.380> hour<00:01:46.530> 10<00:01:47.369> minutes<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
little while half an hour 10 minutes you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.149 
little while half an hour 10 minutes you
could<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> look<00:01:49.619> something<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.009> this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
could get it to look something like this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.110 
all button and as you can see you are
able<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:19.099> vertices<00:02:20.099> but<00:02:20.909> you<00:02:21.030> are

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
able to see all the vertices but you are

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.229 
able to see all the vertices but you are
still<00:02:21.209> able<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.720> modify<00:02:21.959> those<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
still able to modify those with the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.250 
still able to modify those with the
modifier<00:02:24.690> applied<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.590> I'm<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.159> going<00:02:27.090> to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
modifier applied so I'm just going to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.920 
modifier applied so I'm just going to
edit<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.290> part<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.510> as<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.629> can<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:30.810> i

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
edit this part here and as you can see i

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.289 
edit this part here and as you can see i
selected<00:02:31.440> these<00:02:31.650> four<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.580> when<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.000> narrow

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
selected these four so when I narrow

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.080 
selected these four so when I narrow
these<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.750> its<00:02:34.470> own<00:02:34.650> those<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.250> selected<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
these in its own those are selected and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.059 
these in its own those are selected and
I'll<00:02:36.750> actually<00:02:36.989> move<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.920> bit

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
I'll actually move these in a bit

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.569 
I'll actually move these in a bit
further<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.349> now<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.950> looks<00:02:41.220> more

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
further like so so now it looks more

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:48.170 
further like so so now it looks more
like<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.620> bar<00:02:44.159> bottom<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:46.200> button<00:02:47.030> here<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
like the bar bottom the button here and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.990 
like the bar bottom the button here and
it<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:48.599> select<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.400> remove<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.790> out

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
it just select this and remove this out

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.830 
it just select this and remove this out
back<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> bit<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> nice<00:02:54.510> round

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
back a bit like so to get a nice round

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.759 
back a bit like so to get a nice round
shape<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.790> basically<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.049> how<00:02:58.349> you<00:02:58.410> add<00:02:58.739> a

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
shape so basically this is how you add a

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.720 
shape so basically this is how you add a
modifier<00:02:59.010> to<00:03:00.000> make<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.299> look<00:03:00.420> smoother<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
modifier to make it look smoother and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.680 
modifier to make it look smoother and
you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.879> actually<00:03:03.060> convert<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.109> into<00:03:04.349> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you can actually convert this into a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.180 
you can actually convert this into a
editable<00:03:06.690> poly<00:03:06.840> again<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:07.980> see

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
editable poly again and you will see

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.819 
editable poly again and you will see
that<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:08.780> many<00:03:09.780> more<00:03:10.019> vertices<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.680> you

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
that you get many more vertices and you

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.400 
that you get many more vertices and you
got<00:03:11.160> before<00:03:11.549> but<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
got before but this is because the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.890 
got before but this is because the
modification<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.280> has<00:03:14.609> been<00:03:14.940> applied<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.599> your

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
modification is has been applied to your

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.270 
modification is has been applied to your
model<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:18.139> so<00:03:19.139> that's<00:03:19.349> basically<00:03:19.560> what<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
model so so that's basically what I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.430 
model so so that's basically what I
wanted<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.669> talk<00:03:20.910> about<00:03:20.970> now<00:03:21.329> in<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.290> next

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
wanted to talk about now in the next

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.780 
wanted to talk about now in the next
tutorial<00:03:22.620> I'll<00:03:23.099> show<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.400> how<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:24.049> make<00:03:25.049> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
tutorial I'll show you how to make a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.430 
tutorial I'll show you how to make a
sketch<00:03:26.790> put<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> skeleton<00:03:27.690> inside<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.230> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
sketch put a skeleton inside it to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.520 
sketch put a skeleton inside it to
animate<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.190> model<00:03:30.079> before<00:03:31.079> we<00:03:31.349> do<00:03:31.500> that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
animate this model before we do that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.430 
animate this model before we do that
I'll<00:03:31.919> just<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.639> hit<00:03:32.970> C<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.599> undo<00:03:34.049> the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
I'll just go and hit C to undo the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.210 
I'll just go and hit C to undo the
merging<00:03:34.889> and<00:03:35.450> i'll<00:03:36.450> see<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:36.989> next<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.709> this

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
merging and i'll see you on next to this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.120 
merging and i'll see you on next to this
