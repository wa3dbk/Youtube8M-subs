or a gif the general rule of thumb is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
or a gif the general rule of thumb is
for<00:01:32.460> photographs<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.240> pretty<00:01:33.509> much<00:01:33.570> save<00:01:33.930> it

for photographs you pretty much save it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
for photographs you pretty much save it
as<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> JPEG<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> keep<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
as a JPEG so we're going to keep it as a
