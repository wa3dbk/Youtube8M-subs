00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello everyone I'm sweet and 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.300
 salty and today we are going to make a chicken 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.100
 fried in the oven that in a matter of 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.440
 texture and taste is very similar to 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.570
 normal fried chicken but this one has less 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.640
 Perfect calories to eat more 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.650
 healthy this year as always the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.420
 link this recipe will be available at 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.080
 end of the video and the box 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.080
 information 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.669
 to make this chicken fried in the oven 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.800
 we are going to use chicken breasts that 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.329
 They are healthier and we will remove them 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.329
 all the fat you have 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.160
 and how can you see this half breast 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.320
 It's a bit thick so we're going to 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.409
 cut in half to have a portion 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.960
 thinner we place our hand on 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.879
 the breast and very carefully we do 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.879
 a cut on the side of the breast 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.949
 We are cutting with the knife slowly 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 until you can open the breast and then the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 we cut in half 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.150
 in this way we end up with a breast 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.730
 thinner chicken 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.190
 now let's season the breasts well 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.990
 I am seasoned with paprika but 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.880
 if you want, you can use chile 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.880
 in powder or even cumin 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.060
 they are also masters with a little bit of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.060
 onion powder 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.229
 garlic powder 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.000
 and salt and pepper to taste and this 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.000
 let's do on both sides 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.830
 then in a container that is not very 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.020
 We are going to place a little serum 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.970
 of milk and if they can not get serum 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.820
 of milk can be substituted with milk 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.790
 whole lemon and a little too 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.530
 add a spoonful of mustard this 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.560
 It is optional but it gives very good flavor to 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.620
 chicken and season with salt and pepper 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.620
 taste 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.120
 Now we stir well 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.890
 and we put our seasoned breasts 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.690
 in the whey 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.410
 we make sure they are well 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.410
 covers 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.170
 we cover the container with plastic 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.069
 kitchen or paper film and refrigera moss by 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 at least 30 minutes 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.260
 Now let's prepare the flour for 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.090
 turn off I'm using panko flour 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.499
 which is more crispy but you 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.469
 they can also use bread crumbs 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:25.060
 regular and this flour we are going to season 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.060
 well with salt and pepper to taste 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.110
 then we take the breasts from the fridge 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.570
 and we're going to cover them well with the flour 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.610
 after covering them we will place them 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.190
 on a greased rack that is 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.320
 on a baking tin of this 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.490
 shape will circulate air and flour 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.490
 it's not going to be very wet 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.080
 then we bake the chicken at 350 degrees 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.180
 for approximately 20 to 25 minutes and 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.160
 for the last 2 to 3 minutes to me 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.720
 I like to learn the broiler so that 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.720
 they are more golden on top 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.210
 and that's how easy it is to prepare a fried chicken 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.190
 baked that is healthy but that 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.190
 it is also crispy and delicious 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.990
