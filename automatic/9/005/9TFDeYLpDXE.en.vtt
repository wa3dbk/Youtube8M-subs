00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
in-home diagnostic video brought to you

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.240 
in-home diagnostic video brought to you
by<00:00:20.400> appliance<00:00:20.880> video<00:00:21.150> comm<00:00:21.920> all<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.070> we're

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
by appliance video comm all right we're

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.570 
by appliance video comm all right we're
on<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> LG<00:00:24.330> washing<00:00:24.689> machine<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.769> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
on a LG washing machine that is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.300 
on a LG washing machine that is
squealing<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
squealing so what we're going to do is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.209 
squealing so what we're going to do is
run<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.820> through<00:00:30.029> its<00:00:30.560> diagnostic<00:00:31.560> tests<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
run it through its diagnostic tests and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
run it through its diagnostic tests and
the<00:00:33.059> way<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the way to do that is to have it in the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
the way to do that is to have it in the
idle<00:00:35.610> mode<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.239> nothing<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.739> they

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
idle mode with nothing on and then they

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.209 
idle mode with nothing on and then they
hit<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> soil<00:00:39.329> level<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> spin<00:00:40.440> speed<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
hit the soil level and spin speed at the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
hit the soil level and spin speed at the
same<00:00:41.430> time<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.660> hit<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> power<00:00:43.140> button

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
same time and then hit the power button

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.630 
same time and then hit the power button
and<00:00:44.360> right<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.660> it'll<00:00:45.899> it'll<00:00:46.710> flash<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and right here it'll it'll flash the the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.290 
and right here it'll it'll flash the the
code<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> tell<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.570> machine<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
code to tell it what machine it is and

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.130 
code to tell it what machine it is and
then<00:00:51.300> we'll<00:00:51.870> hit<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> start<00:00:52.890> button<00:00:52.980> once<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
then we'll hit the start button once it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.639 
then we'll hit the start button once it
immediately<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:56.309> locks<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> door<00:00:57.440> turns<00:00:58.440> on

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
immediately it locks the door turns on

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.959 
immediately it locks the door turns on
the<00:00:58.829> drain<00:00:59.129> pump<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> starts<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> tumble<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
the drain pump and starts to tumble and

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
the drain pump and starts to tumble and
then<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> advance<00:01:03.960> through<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
then if we want to advance through the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.929 
then if we want to advance through the
steps<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.350> start<00:01:07.619> button<00:01:07.979> again<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
steps with the start button again you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.810 
steps with the start button again you
have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> wait<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.700> our

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
have to wait so right now we're in our

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
have to wait so right now we're in our
loads<00:01:12.450> low<00:01:13.290> speed<00:01:14.040> spin<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> display

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
loads low speed spin and the display

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.140 
loads low speed spin and the display
shows<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.979> RPMs<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> we're<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> hit<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
shows the RPMs so we're going to hit the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.660 
shows the RPMs so we're going to hit the
start<00:01:21.150> button<00:01:21.270> again<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.930> advance<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> now

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
start button again to advance it and now

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.550 
start button again to advance it and now
it's<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.630> high<00:01:25.290> speed<00:01:25.710> spin

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's going to go into a high speed spin

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.399 
it's going to go into a high speed spin
and<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> watch<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> RPMs<00:01:29.850> start<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> raise

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.550 

for<00:01:34.399> most<00:01:34.610> squealing<00:01:35.360> sounds<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.110> is<00:01:36.320> where

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
for most squealing sounds this is where

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.500 
for most squealing sounds this is where
you<00:01:36.770> would<00:01:36.950> hear<00:01:37.750> your<00:01:38.750> squealing

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.050 

so<00:01:44.810> right<00:01:45.110> now<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:45.410> have<00:01:45.620> achieved<00:01:45.950> our<00:01:46.580> our

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
so right now we have achieved our our

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.170 
so right now we have achieved our our
highest<00:01:47.480> RPMs<00:01:48.290> on<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.190> high<00:01:49.400> speed<00:01:49.790> spin

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
highest RPMs on the the high speed spin

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.600 
highest RPMs on the the high speed spin
and<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:51.460> don't<00:01:52.460> hear<00:01:52.730> any<00:01:52.910> noise<00:01:52.940> right<00:01:53.600> now

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
and I don't hear any noise right now

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.880 
and I don't hear any noise right now
we're<00:01:55.610> going<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.820> advance<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.750> again<00:01:57.080> what

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
we're going to advance it again what

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.030 
we're going to advance it again what
this<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:58.580> should<00:01:58.910> do<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.390> turn<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.260> the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
this one should do is turn on the the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.820 
this one should do is turn on the the
pre-wash<00:02:01.580> inlet<00:02:02.420> valve<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:03.050> that's<00:02:03.680> only

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
pre-wash inlet valve and that's only

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.230 
pre-wash inlet valve and that's only
going<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.100> happen<00:02:04.310> when<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.390> RPMs<00:02:06.320> go<00:02:06.770> down

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
going to happen when the RPMs go down

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.490 
going to happen when the RPMs go down
enough<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.510> advance<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.410> next<00:02:09.440> step<00:02:10.240> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
enough to advance to the next step and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.320 
enough to advance to the next step and
as<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.710> continue<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.490> through<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.940> steps

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
as we continue on through the steps

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.660 
as we continue on through the steps
we'll<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.350> checking<00:02:15.590> all<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.310> different

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
we'll be checking all the different

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.960 
we'll be checking all the different
valves<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.930> your<00:02:18.280> hot<00:02:19.280> water<00:02:20.140> bleach

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
valves for your hot water bleach

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.470 
valves for your hot water bleach
softener<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.630> pre-wash<00:02:24.940> we'll<00:02:25.940> also<00:02:26.120> check

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
softener and pre-wash we'll also check

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.330 
softener and pre-wash we'll also check
the<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.960> heater<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> circulation<00:02:28.310> pump

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the the heater of the circulation pump

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.330 
the the heater of the circulation pump
and<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.940> drain<00:02:29.240> pump<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.680> right<00:02:30.890> now<00:02:31.070> it's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
and the drain pump so right now it's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.600 
and the drain pump so right now it's
just<00:02:31.550> settling<00:02:32.450> down<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.980> we're<00:02:34.190> waiting<00:02:34.430> to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
just settling down and we're waiting to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.380 
just settling down and we're waiting to
advance<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.570> next<00:02:35.600> level<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.980> our

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
advance to the next level on our

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.000 
advance to the next level on our
Diagnostics<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.200> far<00:02:39.470> ever<00:02:39.710> everything

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
Diagnostics so far ever everything

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.830 
Diagnostics so far ever everything
sounds<00:02:40.670> pretty<00:02:40.910> good

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.070 

and<00:02:43.959> our<00:02:44.709> drum<00:02:45.370> has<00:02:45.610> stopped<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.269> we're

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
and our drum has stopped and we're

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.339 
and our drum has stopped and we're
filling<00:02:47.290> through<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.800> pre-wash<00:02:49.170> we're<00:02:50.170> going

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
filling through the pre-wash we're going

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.080 
filling through the pre-wash we're going
to<00:02:50.410> advance<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.220> fill<00:02:51.459> through<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.849> main

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
to advance and fill through the main

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.680 
to advance and fill through the main
wash<00:02:53.489> advancing<00:02:54.489> one<00:02:54.670> more<00:02:54.879> time<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.599> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
wash advancing one more time for the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.309 
wash advancing one more time for the
softener<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.500> through<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.610> little<00:02:58.319> cover

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
softener and through this little cover

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.190 
softener and through this little cover
we<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.860> see<00:03:00.099> all<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.000> where<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:01.810> water<00:03:02.049> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
we can see all the where the water is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.220 
we can see all the where the water is
flowing<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.700> as<00:03:04.090> we<00:03:04.299> advance<00:03:04.720> through<00:03:05.080> our

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
flowing so as we advance through our

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.979 
flowing so as we advance through our
steps<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.330> turning<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.480> different

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
steps and turning on the different

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.979 
steps and turning on the different
valves<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.620> fill<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.160> unit<00:03:09.519> we<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.540> lift

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
valves that fill the unit we just lift

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.070 
valves that fill the unit we just lift
up<00:03:11.140> lift<00:03:11.680> up<00:03:11.860> our<00:03:12.250> cover<00:03:12.580> here<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.840> see

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
up lift up our cover here and can see

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.380 
up lift up our cover here and can see
where<00:03:14.500> all<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.040> water<00:03:15.220> where<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.060> different

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
where all the water where the different

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.839 
where all the water where the different
valves<00:03:16.810> are<00:03:16.959> opening<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.530> closing<00:03:18.099> then

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
valves are opening and closing then

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.759 
valves are opening and closing then
right<00:03:19.329> now<00:03:19.510> we're<00:03:19.780> filling<00:03:20.019> up<00:03:20.260> our<00:03:20.730> softener

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
right now we're filling up our softener

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.250 
right now we're filling up our softener
the<00:03:23.769> next<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.459> will<00:03:24.910> have<00:03:25.060> our<00:03:25.360> our<00:03:25.660> bleach

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the next one will have our our bleach

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.430 
the next one will have our our bleach
and<00:03:26.940> we<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.120> water<00:03:28.450> coming<00:03:28.660> through<00:03:29.230> there

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
and we have water coming through there

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.390 
and we have water coming through there
so<00:03:29.829> all<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.370> different<00:03:30.700> valves<00:03:30.940> are<00:03:31.360> working

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
so all the different valves are working

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.059 
so all the different valves are working
the<00:03:33.400> next<00:03:33.730> step<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.239> it's<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.819> tumble

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the next step is it's going to tumble

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.610 
the next step is it's going to tumble
counterclockwise<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:41.319> doing<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:43.620> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
counterclockwise and it's doing that the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.190 
counterclockwise and it's doing that the
next<00:03:44.920> step<00:03:45.129> on<00:03:45.340> our<00:03:45.629> Diagnostics<00:03:46.629> is<00:03:46.750> turning

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
next step on our Diagnostics is turning

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.949 
next step on our Diagnostics is turning
the<00:03:47.319> heater<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:48.120> that's<00:03:49.120> something<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
the heater on that's something that you

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.780 
the heater on that's something that you
would<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.829> get<00:03:50.920> down<00:03:50.980> there<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.459> make

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
would have to get down there to make

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.629 
would have to get down there to make
sure<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.420> happening<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:54.160> now<00:03:54.310> we're<00:03:54.549> going

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
sure it's happening but now we're going

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.270 
sure it's happening but now we're going
to<00:03:54.730> turn<00:03:54.970> on<00:03:55.180> our<00:03:55.389> circulation<00:03:56.319> pump<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:57.220> is

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
to turn on our circulation pump this is

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.890 
to turn on our circulation pump this is
another<00:03:57.700> point<00:03:58.000> where<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.329> could<00:03:58.510> get<00:03:58.660> some

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
another point where you could get some

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.289 
another point where you could get some
some<00:03:59.319> noise<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:01.269> if<00:04:02.019> we<00:04:02.139> look<00:04:02.349> in<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.590> front

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
some noise and if we look in the front

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.849 
some noise and if we look in the front
we<00:04:04.299> can<00:04:04.480> not<00:04:04.599> only<00:04:04.630> hear<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.260> circulation

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
we can not only hear the circulation

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.039 
we can not only hear the circulation
pump<00:04:05.889> going<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.269> can<00:04:07.420> see<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.810> water

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
pump going but you can see the water

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.379 
pump going but you can see the water
actually<00:04:08.549> circulating<00:04:09.549> through<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.090> front

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
actually circulating through the front

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.360 
actually circulating through the front
and<00:04:11.910> everything<00:04:12.910> sounds<00:04:13.359> normal<00:04:13.660> there<00:04:14.370> so

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
and everything sounds normal there so

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.000 
and everything sounds normal there so
the<00:04:15.579> next<00:04:15.819> step<00:04:16.090> will<00:04:16.959> advance<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.590> turn<00:04:17.829> the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
the next step will advance to turn the

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.849 
the next step will advance to turn the
drain<00:04:18.310> pump<00:04:18.639> on<00:04:18.849> and<00:04:19.209> we<00:04:20.049> can<00:04:20.200> keep<00:04:20.410> everything

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
drain pump on and we can keep everything

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.760 
drain pump on and we can keep everything
in<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.280> drain<00:04:21.669> pump<00:04:21.880> sounds<00:04:22.360> normal<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:23.740> can

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
in the drain pump sounds normal you can

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.890 
in the drain pump sounds normal you can
hear<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.520> water<00:04:25.000> going<00:04:25.360> out<00:04:25.860> into<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.430> drain

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
hear the water going out into the drain

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.629 
hear the water going out into the drain
you<00:04:28.900> can<00:04:29.080> actually<00:04:29.380> see<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.770> disappearing

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
you can actually see it disappearing

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.719 
you can actually see it disappearing
quickly<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.530> basically<00:04:32.979> runs<00:04:33.310> through

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
quickly and that basically runs through

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.210 
quickly and that basically runs through
all<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:33.940> all<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.750> steps<00:04:35.110> on<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.919> the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
all the all the steps on here the the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.089 
all the all the steps on here the the
last<00:04:36.460> step<00:04:37.450> in<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.750> Diagnostics<00:04:38.530> will<00:04:38.740> unlock

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
last step in the Diagnostics will unlock

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:44.800 
last step in the Diagnostics will unlock
the<00:04:39.340> door<00:04:39.700> and<00:04:41.370> so<00:04:42.370> currently<00:04:42.760> we<00:04:43.120> find<00:04:43.450> no

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
the door and so currently we find no
