00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.680 
second is an inside miter now watch they
don't<00:02:14.650> fit<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.910> have<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.359> is<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.660> to

remove all of the wood in back of the
leading<00:02:18.910> edge<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:19.780> called<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.170> cope

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
leading edge and that's called a cope

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.809 
leading edge and that's called a cope
cut<00:02:20.739> let<00:02:21.040> me<00:02:21.100> show<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.280> how<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.609> that

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
alright now the first thing I've done is

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.190 
alright now the first thing I've done is
I've<00:02:24.160> darkened<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.299> leading<00:02:25.630> edge<00:02:25.810> with<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
I've darkened the leading edge with a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.080 
I've darkened the leading edge with a
pencil<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.799> can<00:02:26.859> follow<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.519> I'm<00:02:28.000> going

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
pencil so I can follow it and I'm going

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.090 
pencil so I can follow it and I'm going
to<00:02:28.150> cut<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.660> with<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.019> coping<00:02:29.620> saw<00:02:29.799> right

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
to cut that with this coping saw right

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.759 
to cut that with this coping saw right
here<00:02:30.130> thin<00:02:31.000> blade<00:02:31.359> will<00:02:31.870> curve<00:02:32.260> right<00:02:32.530> around

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
here thin blade will curve right around

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.039 
here thin blade will curve right around
to<00:02:32.980> follow<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.459> now<00:02:34.180> hold<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> right

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
to follow it now hold it in the right

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.410 
to follow it now hold it in the right
orientation<00:02:35.310> holding<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.430> saw<00:02:36.639> level<00:02:37.299> with

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
orientation holding the saw level with

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.780 
orientation holding the saw level with
the<00:02:37.569> split<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.139> floor<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:39.160> want<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.489> tilt

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
the split the floor and I want to tilt

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.870 
the split the floor and I want to tilt
it<00:02:39.970> back<00:02:40.209> slightly<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.069> just<00:02:42.190> follow<00:02:42.639> that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
it back slightly now I just follow that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.540 
it back slightly now I just follow that
leading<00:02:43.180> edge

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.250 

does<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> blade<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.209> thin<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.810> can<00:02:52.870> follow

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
does the blade is so thin it can follow

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:06.619 
does the blade is so thin it can follow
on<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> curve<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.099> even<00:02:54.489> turn<00:02:54.730> tight<00:02:55.090> angles

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.570 

so<00:03:07.629> it's<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.200> leading<00:03:08.470> edge<00:03:08.590> them<00:03:08.799> yep

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
so it's just the leading edge them yep

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.729 
so it's just the leading edge them yep
that's<00:03:10.239> all<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.599> gonna<00:03:10.690> see<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.379> ideas

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
that's all you're gonna see the ideas

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.920 
that's all you're gonna see the ideas
remove<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.340> would<00:03:12.519> behind<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.360> lines<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
remove it would behind the lines of the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.780 
remove it would behind the lines of the
two<00:03:14.140> pieces<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.530> molding<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.099> meet<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.760> I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
two pieces of molding to meet that I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.850 
two pieces of molding to meet that I
want<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.239> make<00:03:16.390> sure<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.989> leave<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.560> line<00:03:19.860> now

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
want to make sure to leave the line now

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.680 
want to make sure to leave the line now
before<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.340> install<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.910> molding<00:03:22.329> I'll<00:03:22.510> need

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
before I install this molding I'll need

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.330 
before I install this molding I'll need
to<00:03:22.780> smooth<00:03:23.079> out<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.349> rough<00:03:23.650> edges<00:03:23.920> with<00:03:24.190> some

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
to smooth out the rough edges with some

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.449 
to smooth out the rough edges with some
fine<00:03:24.640> grit<00:03:24.670> sandpaper<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:26.110> for<00:03:26.349> now<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:27.220> hard

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
fine grit sandpaper but for now the hard

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.729 
fine grit sandpaper but for now the hard
part<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.880> done<00:03:28.060> that's<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.079> basic<00:03:29.410> idea

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
part is done that's the basic idea

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.910 
part is done that's the basic idea
behind<00:03:29.799> an<00:03:30.310> inside<00:03:30.640> cope
