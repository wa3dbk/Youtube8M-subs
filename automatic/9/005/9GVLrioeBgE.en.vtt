hi I'm Corbett Lunsford from Green dream

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.330 
hi I'm Corbett Lunsford from Green dream
group<00:00:06.630> in<00:00:07.380> this<00:00:07.559> segment<00:00:07.740> we're<00:00:08.010> gonna<00:00:08.069> work

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
group in this segment we're gonna work

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.390 
group in this segment we're gonna work
on<00:00:08.519> caulking<00:00:09.269> small<00:00:09.630> gaps<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.530> cracks<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.309> we

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
on caulking small gaps and cracks and we

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.789 
on caulking small gaps and cracks and we
can<00:00:11.519> see<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.150> infrared<00:00:12.480> camera<00:00:12.929> here<00:00:13.139> that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
can see on the infrared camera here that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.499 
can see on the infrared camera here that
there<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> small<00:00:14.400> area<00:00:14.759> up<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:14.910> which<00:00:15.330> has

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
there is a small area up there which has

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.930 
there is a small area up there which has
dark<00:00:15.839> which<00:00:16.110> means<00:00:16.350> cold<00:00:16.680> next<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.550> light

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
dark which means cold next to light

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
dark which means cold next to light
colors<00:00:18.330> which<00:00:18.600> mean<00:00:18.810> warm<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.860> that<00:00:19.980> means

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
colors which mean warm so that means

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.620 
colors which mean warm so that means
that<00:00:20.280> there's<00:00:20.490> air<00:00:20.700> leakage<00:00:21.000> through<00:00:21.450> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that there's air leakage through that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.690 
that there's air leakage through that
area<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> I've<00:00:22.920> marked<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> small

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
area and I've marked it with a small

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000 
area and I've marked it with a small
tape<00:00:23.940> if<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.540> do<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.870> have<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> $5,000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
tape if you do not have a $5,000

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
tape if you do not have a $5,000
infrared<00:00:26.490> camera<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.600> find<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.020> where

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
infrared camera you can find out where

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
infrared camera you can find out where
your<00:00:28.530> cracks<00:00:28.860> and<00:00:29.100> gaps<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:30.450> are<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
your cracks and gaps are that are the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
your cracks and gaps are that are the
important<00:00:31.080> ones<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.650> an<00:00:31.770> energy<00:00:32.070> audit<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
important ones with an energy audit and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.799 
important ones with an energy audit and
this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> standard<00:00:33.030> procedure<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.660> our

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
this is standard procedure with all our

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
this is standard procedure with all our
energy<00:00:34.079> audits<00:00:34.379> you'd<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.830> a<00:00:35.270> detailed

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
energy audits you'd get a detailed

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
energy audits you'd get a detailed
report<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.740> all<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.130> images<00:00:38.490> of<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
report that has all the images of the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.700 
report that has all the images of the
important<00:00:39.090> places<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.450> focus<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.470> we're

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
important places to focus on so we're

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530 
important places to focus on so we're
gonna<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.980> ahead<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.130> caulk<00:00:41.400> that<00:00:41.460> area<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
gonna go ahead and caulk that area the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
gonna go ahead and caulk that area the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
only thing you'll need for this project

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
only thing you'll need for this project
is<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.090> caulk<00:00:45.420> gun<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.410> canister<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> caulk

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
is a caulk gun and a canister of caulk

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
is a caulk gun and a canister of caulk
this<00:00:47.579> costs<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.450> two<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.810> three<00:00:48.840> dollars

this costs about two or three dollars

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.800 
this costs about two or three dollars
and<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.670> relatively<00:00:51.120> inexpensive<00:00:51.329> as

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
and this is relatively inexpensive as

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
well I've already used this so I don't

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.190 
well I've already used this so I don't
need<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:53.730> snippet<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> caulk<00:00:54.630> gun<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
need a snippet but a caulk gun has a

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.790 
need a snippet but a caulk gun has a
little<00:00:55.620> hole<00:00:56.130> where<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:57.079> open<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.350> tip

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
little hole where you can open the tip

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.330 
little hole where you can open the tip
of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.310> caulk<00:01:00.270> canister<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.770> I've<00:01:01.950> opened

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
of the caulk canister so I've opened

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
of the caulk canister so I've opened
that<00:01:02.700> up<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.720> did<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.619> very<00:01:05.129> small

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that up and I did it in this very small

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.940 
that up and I did it in this very small
way<00:01:06.060> there<00:01:06.299> are<00:01:06.420> markings<00:01:06.749> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.530> tip<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.829> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
way there are markings on the tip of the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.109 
way there are markings on the tip of the
caulk<00:01:08.130> gun<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.399> tell<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.639> how<00:01:08.759> big<00:01:08.939> you're

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
caulk gun to tell you how big you're

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.959 
caulk gun to tell you how big you're
gonna<00:01:09.179> do<00:01:09.920> take<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.069> out<00:01:14.329> break<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.479> seal

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
gonna do take this out break the seal

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.020 
gonna do take this out break the seal
put<00:01:17.969> that<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.560> load<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.340> call<00:01:20.549> canister

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
put that back load the call canister

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.879 
put that back load the call canister
into<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> gun<00:01:22.369> tighten<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.459> up<00:01:23.579> so<00:01:23.819> that<00:01:24.889> it's

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:25.889 
into the gun tighten it up so that it's

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:28.489 
into the gun tighten it up so that it's
tight<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:26.429> it's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.759> coming<00:01:26.969> out<00:01:27.209> and<00:01:27.499> now

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
tight and it's not coming out and now

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.859 
tight and it's not coming out and now
caulk<00:01:28.799> will<00:01:28.979> start<00:01:29.189> coming<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.639> the<00:01:29.869> spout

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
caulk will start coming out of the spout

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:41.750 
caulk will start coming out of the spout
there

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.590 

working<00:01:42.570> smoke<00:01:42.930> slowly<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.650> smoothly

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
working smoke slowly and smoothly

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.940 
working smoke slowly and smoothly
applying<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> nice<00:01:45.960> bead<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.470> caulk<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
applying the nice bead of caulk and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
applying the nice bead of caulk and
again<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.640> don't<00:01:47.760> have<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.180> make<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.450> look

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
again you don't have to make it look

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.760 
again you don't have to make it look
perfect<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.290> because<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.680> gonna

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
perfect right now because we're gonna

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.220 
perfect right now because we're gonna
come<00:01:49.980> back<00:01:50.100> later<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.610> clean<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.510> up<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
come back later and clean it up if you

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.380 
come back later and clean it up if you
find<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.650> your<00:01:52.800> caulk<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.640> bumpy<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
find that your caulk is really bumpy and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.590 
find that your caulk is really bumpy and
not<00:01:54.660> very<00:01:54.900> even<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.680> mine<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:56.300> you<00:01:57.300> can<00:01:57.450> use

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not very even like mine is you can use

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.330 
not very even like mine is you can use
this<00:01:57.810> tool<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.620> looks<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> witch's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this tool that looks like a witch's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.150 
this tool that looks like a witch's
finger<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:01.140> clean<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.680> while<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:01.920> still

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
finger to clean it up while it's still
