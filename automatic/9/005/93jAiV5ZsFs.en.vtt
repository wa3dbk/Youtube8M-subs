 professional issues

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.300
 solidarity football new the workshop is not 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.460
 more in climbing and it's a natural point 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.860
 between technique and own language 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.230
 with acquiring knowledge and resources 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.390

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 Pledge to explore our spaces more

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.460
 creativity and humiliated expression 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.760
 What I like to do most is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.370
 is to work very directly with the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.670
 metal I try not to measure does not cheer not 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.600
 close to weld and this leads to the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.610
 hammer forge and a piece of metal 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.049

 techniques such as casting the profusion 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.049
 the jewelry design or the silverware the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 another mythical wedding workshop the courses are 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 designed for people who tend 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.149
 start the jewelry as for initiates and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.149
 professionals of the sector 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.969
 normally what is proposed here in the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.560
 vegueries field that was previously 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.539
 If the jewelry is metal or stone 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.799
 that you take a stone that had some 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.289
 special features that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.659
 it worked as surely as an amulet 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.050
 and it did something to bring 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.019
 put the theme of ornamentation or went to 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.900
 backwards one takes a metal that had some 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.459
 very special features and it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920
 he tried to do something to take it to 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.880
 identify yourself in america 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 I'm leaving that goes is preached without thinking 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.709
 you see civilizations and cultures 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.020
 that theoretically are less advanced 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.710
 that our 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.610
 Well, you have to think that it was the stone 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.950
 or the object 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.830
 the best time is when I see that the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.120
 communication is good and that the student 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.990
 thrills when there is that moment for me 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.990
 it's quite gratifying
