 the little plant that you sent me I have it in 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.260
 the entrance of the house I planted in a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.570
 Y 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.870
 Of course, what happens is that I am 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:17.910
 fanatic of 2009 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.910
 enough to sell your dad's plants 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:29.000
 I'm obsessed and clear 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.830
 it starts that the mind is going to get over 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.080
 the change goes with this piece 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 and then there may be more pieces 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 then you can remove 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.910
 then that's what the new 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.540
 about this why I was telling you 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.790
 that we do not spare anything and not only 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.810
 as gold because otherwise but also 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.810
 as for the use 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.000
 Beauty and all the pieces are the jewels 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.870

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.180

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.099
 this comes a promotion 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.600
 big 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.740
 just like MichoacÃ¡n and suddenly before 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.740

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.770

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.310
 miserable 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.620
 where our metal fabrics always 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.810
 they throw in a different way and then a 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.290
 invitation to be great pieces 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.050
 proportion using several many 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.980

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.980

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.409
 starts 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.940

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.940

 they require an entire store and I will pay 

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:31.040
