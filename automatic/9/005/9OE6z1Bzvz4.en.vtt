00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.330
 Hello everyone, let's talk about the stars 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 a pair of white 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.339
 these stars are alternately excised 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.320
 by purchasing what accordingly prevents 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.330
 hit the chain and gives the opportunity 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.609
 use one star take care of 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.960
 pedal system in the absence of any 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.269
 dampers on this magnificent 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.240
 unit installed a double system 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.810
 two leading stars they will change to 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.870
 one 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.870
 oval star tech bytes people 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.180
 as usual for work we will need 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.940
 tool bike and brains 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.859
 and of course the hands without which all this 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.340
 it would be impossible to apply and so 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.170
 start the process first you need 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.210
 release front perekidka 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.210
 so we remove vypressovyvaem pin 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.530
 carefully remove the chain 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.200
 get rid of spare parts to 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.660
 technology can also lose weight system 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.590
 carriage bb 30 provides stubborn 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.410
 nut and and you must first release and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:35.830
 wring out now the left step is removed he 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:41.030
 unscrew the release bolt itself and 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.210
 We hang together with the rod often 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:49.880
 in production 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:56.450
 vypressovyvayem shaft not means them all 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.100
 do neatly connect with on 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 removed details in the future you need 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.300
 will work therefore enough 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.300
 it would be logical to clear them immediately from 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.940
 old lubricants push 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.009
 we remove ponki which keeps small 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 the star 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.530
 unscrewing process can remove them 3 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.530
 by hand 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.670
 and the rest of the spare parts where 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.950
 using a special key for 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.950
 holding the canopy unscrew the remaining 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.260
 along with the punks clean decorative 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.260
 lining 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.060
 release the leading star from the spider 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.770
 Some parts obviously still useful 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.620
 consider a new oval star and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.560
 an indicator is detected on it for 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.420
 correct installation 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.420
 indicator is set to the direction of the connecting rod 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.680
 try to install 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:45.000
 racing through the trim and without 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.849
 these star has its own thread for each 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.819
 race we need to see the difference 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.280
 bank entry into thread with reverse 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.260
 side star 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.379
 the difference is obvious decorative trim 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.620
 does not allow bonki to go deep enough 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.489
 on the thread while its absence makes 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.750
 stronger connection 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.700
 it looks like this decision 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.209
 remove the lining to increase 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.530
 strength prepare parts and 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.530
 we put on them fresh lubricant 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.210
 we distribute evenly over the landing 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.210
 surface 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.830
 extra wiping is superfluous 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.110
 Now 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.110
 install the system in reverse order 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.639
 rubber hammer originally spacer 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.639
 the nut needs to be tightened 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.840
 the connecting rod sitting happens on 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.840
 lubricant 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:06:01.770
 we press and fix the clamp tightly 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:01.770
 we adjust the spacer nut and fix 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.510
 it is possible to install a new chain 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.420
 on the ride teeth 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.660
 we put on the appropriate bin thickness 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.040
 chains 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:33.010
 pass the chain along the grip path and 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:33.010
 tension using chain lock 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:54.870
 draw the lock at the top of the line and with pressure 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:59.060
 pedal lock connects check 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.060
 band tension back perekidki 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.139
 benefits of an oval star 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.879
 redistribution and increase 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:25.180
 efficiency 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:28.659
 and the variable feeling of the teeth allows not 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:33.580
 use tensioners thereby reducing 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:35.919
 the total mass and weight of the structure according to 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:40.860
 the end of the work we get very 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:40.860
 efficient and easy transmission 110
