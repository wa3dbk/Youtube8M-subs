00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.230
 will the world's energy panel 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.230
 son 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.010
 this column and here the power panel 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.830
 let's go the power panel of the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.830
 monorail fall 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.780
 this is the power panel leaves panel 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.640
 the monorail has 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.100
 have 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.899
 and I went from there 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 may be part of the auxiliary power supply 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.410
 of co2 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.410
 it's all there 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.629
 ie a power-driven train 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:58.000
 and the real estate tire the tire 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.000
 jaish up the rail only peneus 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 who lost at the top in part 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.729
 lateral and superior to that which has a motor 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.979
 natural 7 seven pressure the guides is not 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.770
 keep his balance remember or 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.250
 not the father of the sad but give up the tire in the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.210
 also has upper 2 which is 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.039
 more likely because here is a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.710
 each engine season 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:32.500
 the monorail moves on tires in a 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.770
 beam concrete teams with energy 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.060
 electric powered so useless 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 bounded by a lateral network 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040
 thanks 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.090
 This is the front of the beast. 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.940
 only lost the side david simms and venus 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.280
 Absolutely surprised. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.280
 greater taking on life 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.970
 ae 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.450
 that's the way people pay the age 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.290
 go inside 1,000 people what 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 means mec 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:13.420
 I thought I was going to stay for eternity 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.870
 the tec rai paolo nÃ©spoli 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 us to the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 I better get out of here, it's competitive.
