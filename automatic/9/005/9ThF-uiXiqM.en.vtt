00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.080
 and what's up we're here with Jason 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.800
 kreis and we will bring the new objects 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.740
 that for the pse are 4 season 4 we 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.990
 They presented the moment we have by 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.410
 here these are the trinquets are already 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.500
 you have a video about them there 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.020
 who occupy this seventh hole then 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.220
 we have 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.280
 around here the first object was this is the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.630
 philosopher but I do not know what it would be like in 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.989
 Spanish we would be the daughter of the stone 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 Philosopher and you 25 golden regeneration 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.580
 every five seconds three weeks each 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.150
 five seconds and a very nice passive 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:49.710
 which makes me give you two gold each time 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.650
 that a minimum allied with a minion that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.810
 be near you forgive an enemy die 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.489
 but they have not killed you that is to say it is 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.510
 an object totally of the super and of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.609
 fact is a football start object 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.610
 this and then the stone can be improved 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.060
 philosopher etc etc that of course is 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.390
 changed let's talk a repeat in 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.790
 this in this chapter of the objects 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.149
 new no of the changed objects because 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.640
 if we are not going to take until tomorrow 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.759
 we have here the scooter in the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.659
 emblem execution or something like 50 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.720
 life 66 of life every five seconds with 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.430
 which also at the price that is 365 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.460
 is a starting object would be bought 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.130
 as with the philosopher's stone baby 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.409
 you would buy the object and three 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.380
 positions 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.090
 and this gives you a passive that says 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.450
 base attacks running aluminum by 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.130
 under 200 of life if you are in champion 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.670
 ally by this effect can not 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.570
 occur more than twice every minute 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.020
 this means that a support can 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 and I mentioned it to the domain in every minute 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.450
 easily and then also says another 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.790
 passive the domain is killed by 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.680
 Execution restore 2% of life 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:17.420
 maximum of the champion next to him 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.290
 and gives the gold equal to kiel plus 5 of 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.500
 gold is to say 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.330
 in theory you would take soro and the champion 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 which is next to you would also take 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.990
 gold only in those domains 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.690
 each minute 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.450
 with which it is a pretty object 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.700
 decent of your by care 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.459
 especially if we consider now his 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.460
 improvement that we are going to analyze we have 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.920
 here 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.380
 rivers the emblem 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.080
 I think repel rapist or something 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.940
 in the case of a little bit I'm going to 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.260
 look for it 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 so the harvester emblem gives it 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.020
 175 life 12 life regeneration 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.080
 every five seconds and still have the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.220
 passive that had our emblem of 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.580
 run 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.530
 very well but we have another improvement that is 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.000
 also another new object that is called 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.490
 the calls of the martín martín is that no 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 do not worry about this because in some 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.940
 and have simply put a drawing 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.640
 again this for example is the crystal of 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.150
 ruby of all life 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.770
 the call of the martyr 400 of life 25 of 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 regeneration of life every five seconds 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.560
 pretty and we have over here that has 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.420
 the two passives before and the one 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.070
 execution and that of giving it life and gold 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.930
 when the ideas with the execution and 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.659
 then you have an active 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.799
 it's called the cure bomb album 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.760
 consume 20 percent of your life 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.109
 current granting a shield to an ally 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.329
 equal to 10 percent of your life 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.420
 for four seconds after those four 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:09.110
 seconds he 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.180
 around we go the shield that has or 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.480
 although the four have been spent 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.780
 seconds it explodes from the ally and makes 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.410
 an area that hurts is to say you 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.699
 you take life tis give life to another in 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.280
 shield form no yes and then there is a 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.260
 explosion around the champion to which 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.830
 he has stretched the shield 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.190
 equal to 10% of your maximum life is worth as 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.900
 magical damage is pretty good enough 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.370
 all right 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.460
 for support that are tanks like me 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.400
 I know how they can join you 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.729
 come very well and of course it will come out 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.669
 in some other goal it's safe I wanted 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.770
 think imagine a shock that has this 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.919
 and he throws the lane and now he has the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.139
 I would like a shield that says you oh my cut 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.660
 it really would not be that big because a 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.330
 model a lot will not have more than 4000 of 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.870
 life more than 5000 so shield 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.169
 It would not be great either but you know 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.539
 it is quite well does not promise promises 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.340
 Well, these are the truth of 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.969
 at the moment the only ones and so new 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.680
 Anibal is strangely a reborn that 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.169
 argued there a lot more and also 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.360
 they are made differently etc 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.020
 but we'll talk about that in another 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.150
 occasion because if we are not going to take 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.800
 a good time I wanted to differentiate it and here 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.500
 you have it 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.080
 and the baby philosopher's stone I'm going to 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.930
 call yes yes 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.110
 you have here the emblem of they executed their 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.150
 improved version and the call of the 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.930
 Hammer the four new milestones 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.880
 not what is said new so that what 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.850
 I hope you liked favorite life 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.820
 and such help a lot anything 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:08.020
 for Kim Jig Craig 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.020
 and if nothing I'm rolling now
