the<00:00:17.070> way<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.029> chassis<00:00:18.689> has<00:00:18.869> been

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
the way to the the chassis has been

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.350 
the way to the the chassis has been
taken<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.619> some<00:00:19.830> stands<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> back<00:00:20.610> so<00:00:21.300> as

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
the wheels are just off the ground so if

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.339 
the wheels are just off the ground so if

the whole thing and we'll put these
springs<00:01:10.230> in<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:11.010> oh<00:01:11.280> look<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.270> guys<00:01:13.310> it's

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
springs in there oh look these guys it's

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
springs in there oh look these guys it's
not<00:01:14.550> out<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.970> probably<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.480> got<00:01:15.630> from

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
not out it's probably when you got from

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.000 
not out it's probably when you got from
under<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> bench<00:01:18.290> okay<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.440> will<00:01:19.770> check<00:01:19.980> a

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
under the bench okay I will check a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.410 
under the bench okay I will check a
couple<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> things<00:01:20.490> we'll<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
couple of things we'll make sure that

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.110 
couple of things we'll make sure that
the<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> set<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> bolts<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.850> not

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
the where the set of bolts go is not

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.820 
the where the set of bolts go is not
elongated<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> differential<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
elongated on the differential that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
elongated on the differential that
sometimes<00:01:26.250> happens<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.910> they<00:01:27.660> just<00:01:27.870> make

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
sometimes happens and they just make

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.450 
sometimes happens and they just make
sure<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.440> they're<00:01:28.620> not<00:01:28.980> round<00:01:29.250> off

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
sure that they're not round off

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.040 
sure that they're not round off
sometimes<00:01:30.210> you've<00:01:30.390> got<00:01:30.510> to<00:01:30.540> put<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> plate<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
sometimes you've got to put a plate on

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.080 
sometimes you've got to put a plate on
there<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.620> well<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.010> but<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.670> often

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
there or well them up but not very often

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.970 
there or well them up but not very often
and<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.780> locate<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.380> whole<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.800> it's

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
and they locate the whole thing it's

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.910 
and they locate the whole thing it's
actually<00:01:35.310> dries<00:01:36.260> forward<00:01:37.260> braking<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.860> all

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
actually dries forward braking and all

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
actually dries forward braking and all
that's<00:01:38.130> taken<00:01:38.580> virtually<00:01:38.940> on<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> little

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that's taken virtually on that little

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.110 
that's taken virtually on that little
center<00:01:39.810> bolt<00:01:40.010> but<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.160> u-bolts<00:01:41.550> clamp<00:01:41.850> down

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
center bolt but the u-bolts clamp down

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.940 
center bolt but the u-bolts clamp down
and<00:01:42.150> help<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:42.990> course<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.410> locates

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and help it of course but that locates

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.040 
channel and that's because as you

straight<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.819> one<00:02:43.819> interesting<00:02:44.269> point<00:02:44.510> about

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
straight in one interesting point about

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.740 
grease it's not in the center and that's

this shackle that could turn up inside

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.770 

now<00:03:21.490> all<00:03:21.790> we've<00:03:21.970> done<00:03:22.000> now<00:03:22.300> is<00:03:22.360> Jack<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
now all we've done now is Jack the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.540 
now all we've done now is Jack the
spring<00:03:23.020> up<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.200> little<00:03:23.410> bit<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.370> wheels

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.670 
spring up a little bit so as the wheels
off<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.820> ground<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.960> means<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.380> center

and<00:03:57.050> they<00:03:57.110> don't<00:03:57.320> get<00:03:57.500> them<00:03:57.590> covered<00:03:57.860> in<00:03:57.980> dirt

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
and they don't get them covered in dirt

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.550 
and they don't get them covered in dirt
after<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.610> briefly<00:03:58.940> give<00:03:59.750> us<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.170> Bach<00:04:00.380> in

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
after I briefly give us that you Bach in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.630 
after I briefly give us that you Bach in
oh<00:04:02.110> yeah<00:04:03.110> this<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.680> make<00:04:03.890> sure<00:04:03.920> when<00:04:04.280> your<00:04:04.400> time

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
oh yeah this is make sure when your time

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.460 
oh yeah this is make sure when your time
in<00:04:04.790> new<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.000> bolts<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.630> actually<00:04:06.050> watch

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
in new you bolts that you actually watch

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.910 
in new you bolts that you actually watch
that<00:04:06.860> they<00:04:07.010> are<00:04:07.210> nicely<00:04:08.710> parallel<00:04:09.710> to<00:04:09.830> the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
that they are nicely parallel to the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.290 
that they are nicely parallel to the
axle<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:11.120> they<00:04:11.750> tighten<00:04:12.140> up<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.380> stay<00:04:12.620> tight

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
axle so they tighten up and stay tight

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.690 
axle so they tighten up and stay tight
is<00:04:14.300> not<00:04:14.720> an<00:04:14.810> out<00:04:15.440> like<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.800> in<00:04:16.070> in<00:04:16.430> coast

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
is not an out like that in in coast

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.420 
is not an out like that in in coast
pretty<00:04:17.090> close<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.750> we<00:04:18.410> recheck<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.100> u-bolts

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
pretty close and we recheck the u-bolts

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.450 
pretty close and we recheck the u-bolts
after<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.940> thousand<00:04:20.359> K<00:04:20.980> because<00:04:21.980> there's<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.310> bit

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
after a thousand K because there's a bit

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.020 
after a thousand K because there's a bit
of<00:04:22.490> movement

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
of movement

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.660 
of movement
there's<00:04:23.390> paint<00:04:23.630> between<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.170> spring<00:04:24.440> leaves

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
there's paint between the spring leaves

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.420 
there's paint between the spring leaves
and<00:04:25.670> they'll<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:27.200> perhaps<00:04:27.470> need<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:28.100> check

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and they'll just perhaps need a a check

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.360 
and they'll just perhaps need a a check
with<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.610> spanner<00:04:29.560> these<00:04:30.560> wheel<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:30.950> need<00:04:31.250> to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
with a spanner these wheel I I need to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.480 
with a spanner these wheel I I need to
leave<00:04:31.550> friction<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.900> doesn't<00:04:33.230> pay<00:04:33.410> to

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
leave friction and it doesn't pay to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.680 
leave friction and it doesn't pay to
lubricate<00:04:34.490> between<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.090> spring<00:04:35.330> leaves<00:04:35.540> to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
lubricate between the spring leaves to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.930 
lubricate between the spring leaves to
make<00:04:35.720> them<00:04:35.990> ride<00:04:36.200> better<00:04:36.460> that's<00:04:37.460> not<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.730> good

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
make them ride better that's not a good

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.290 
make them ride better that's not a good
idea

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
idea

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.760 
idea
people<00:04:38.660> say<00:04:38.810> it'll<00:04:38.990> break<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.350> spring<00:04:39.590> leaves

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
people say it'll break the spring leaves

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.710 
people say it'll break the spring leaves
what<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.070> does<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.430> allow<00:04:40.669> them<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:41.060> collapse

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
what it does is allow them to collapse

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.590 
what it does is allow them to collapse
more<00:04:42.050> than<00:04:42.260> they<00:04:42.410> should<00:04:43.030> they<00:04:44.030> rely<00:04:44.360> on<00:04:44.390> that

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
more than they should they rely on that

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.210 
more than they should they rely on that
in<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.810> leaf<00:04:44.990> friction<00:04:45.380> there's<00:04:45.710> actually<00:04:46.190> a

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
in the leaf friction there's actually a

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.590 
in the leaf friction there's actually a
partial<00:04:46.700> shock<00:04:46.880> absorber<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.270> people<00:04:47.540> that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
partial shock absorber and people that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.930 
partial shock absorber and people that
say<00:04:47.780> that's<00:04:47.960> why<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:48.230> ride<00:04:48.440> rough<00:04:48.680> but

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
say that's why they ride rough but

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.220 
say that's why they ride rough but
they'll<00:04:49.940> gradually<00:04:50.300> come<00:04:50.600> good<00:04:50.780> sometimes

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
they'll gradually come good sometimes

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.770 
they'll gradually come good sometimes
they<00:04:51.650> make<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.890> clicking<00:04:52.280> noise<00:04:52.600> because<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
they make a clicking noise because the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.500 
they make a clicking noise because the
steering<00:04:54.080> pushes<00:04:54.650> across<00:04:55.130> this<00:04:55.550> way<00:04:55.760> when<00:04:56.390> you

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
steering pushes across this way when you

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.090 
steering pushes across this way when you
get<00:04:56.600> across<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.020> one<00:04:57.140> side<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.680> spring<00:04:57.919> lays

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
get across to one side the spring lays

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.200 
get across to one side the spring lays
hand<00:04:58.370> together<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.760> all<00:04:58.820> of<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.910> sudden<00:04:58.940> they

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
hand together and all of a sudden they

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.790 
hand together and all of a sudden they
just<00:04:59.330> let<00:04:59.540> go<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.900> click<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.140> bit<00:05:00.350> but

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
just let go and click a bit but

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.180 
just let go and click a bit but
sometimes<00:05:01.250> because<00:05:01.640> these<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:03.620> little

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
sometimes because these and little

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.490 
sometimes because these and little
rebound<00:05:04.820> clips<00:05:05.210> have<00:05:05.690> come<00:05:05.990> loose<00:05:06.200> and<00:05:06.440> you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
rebound clips have come loose and you

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.840 
rebound clips have come loose and you
can<00:05:06.530> actually<00:05:06.950> squeeze<00:05:07.190> them<00:05:07.490> up<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.669> little

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
can actually squeeze them up a little

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.690 
can actually squeeze them up a little
bit<00:05:08.050> but<00:05:09.050> you'll<00:05:09.890> notice<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.340> clicking

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
bit but you'll notice the clicking

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.880 
bit but you'll notice the clicking
noises<00:05:10.910> sometimes<00:05:11.510> sounds<00:05:12.260> pretty<00:05:12.470> dramatic

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
noises sometimes sounds pretty dramatic

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.560 
noises sometimes sounds pretty dramatic
but<00:05:13.040> it's<00:05:13.190> actually<00:05:13.490> just<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.820> lose<00:05:14.030> just

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
but it's actually just to lose just

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
but it's actually just to lose just
sliding<00:05:14.960> sideways<00:05:15.250> under<00:05:16.250> strain

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.680 

you<00:05:19.590> know<00:05:19.710> this<00:05:20.310> really<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.730> all<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.180> can<00:05:21.540> do

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
you know this really is all you can do

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.930 
you know this really is all you can do
at<00:05:21.900> home<00:05:22.130> but<00:05:23.130> invite<00:05:23.430> your<00:05:23.610> neighbor<00:05:23.820> over

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
at home but invite your neighbor over

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.820 
at home but invite your neighbor over
for<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.420> couple<00:05:24.600> of<00:05:24.720> years<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:25.140> just<00:05:25.410> want<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.710> do

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
for a couple of years we just want to do

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.360 
for a couple of years we just want to do
it<00:05:25.860> right

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
it right

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
not Alateen under the time yeah hit it

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.180 
not Alateen under the time yeah hit it
with<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.800> hammer<00:05:37.460> what<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:38.640> see<00:05:38.820> in<00:05:38.940> favors<00:05:40.190> I'm

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
with a hammer what you see in favors I'm

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:49.300 
with a hammer what you see in favors I'm
doing<00:05:41.430> some<00:05:41.730> way<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.480> hand<00:05:45.830> you<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:47.120> safety

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
doing some way to hand you a safety
