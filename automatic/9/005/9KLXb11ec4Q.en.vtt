wrench<00:00:11.450> I<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> bak<00:00:13.440> makes<00:00:13.740> it

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
wrench I think that the bak makes it

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.060 
wrench I think that the bak makes it

step<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> make<00:00:45.960> sure<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.379> engine

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
step just to make sure that your engine

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.540 
step just to make sure that your engine
is<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> top<00:00:47.010> dead<00:00:47.219> center<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.520> the

is the top dead center on the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.209 
is the top dead center on the
compression<00:00:48.030> stroke<00:00:48.260> what<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
compression stroke what you do is you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
compression stroke what you do is you
rotate<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.550> flywheel<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.750> crf50<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> fire

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
rotate the flywheel on a crf50 the fire

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.720 
rotate the flywheel on a crf50 the fire
was<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> look<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> lot<00:00:53.340> different<00:00:53.399> than

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
was going to look a lot different than

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
was going to look a lot different than
this<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.329> older<00:00:54.539> motor<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this this is an older motor but the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.650 
this this is an older motor but the
principle<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> same<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> make

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
principle is the same you got to make

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.599 
principle is the same you got to make
sure<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.800> team<00:00:59.039> mark<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sure that it's at the team mark on the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
sure that it's at the team mark on the
compression<00:01:00.059> stroke<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
compression stroke now this is not on

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
compression stroke now this is not on
the<00:01:01.530> compression<00:01:01.949> stroke<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.579> tell

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the compression stroke and I can tell

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.100 
the compression stroke and I can tell
because<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.780> spinning

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
because it's it's not it's not spinning

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
because it's it's not it's not spinning
easily<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> that's<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.360> valve

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
easily and that's because it's on valve

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.890 
easily and that's because it's on valve
overlap<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:12.060> springs<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.570> wanting<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
overlap and the springs are wanting to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
overlap and the springs are wanting to
keep<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.260> motor<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
keep this motor right here and if you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039 
keep this motor right here and if you
twist<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.360> way<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> hard<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
twist it this way it's hard and if you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
twist it this way it's hard and if you
twist<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.799> hard<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:17.880> going

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
twist it this way it's hard so I'm going

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
twist it this way it's hard so I'm going
to<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.119> another<00:01:18.590> 360<00:01:19.590> degrees<00:01:20.060> until<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
to go another 360 degrees until I get to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.999 
to go another 360 degrees until I get to
the<00:01:21.479> same<00:01:21.750> mark<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.830> hard

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the same mark and it's going to be hard

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.289 
the same mark and it's going to be hard
to<00:01:23.130> turn<00:01:23.310> getting<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.000> that's<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to turn getting up to it and that's the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
to turn getting up to it and that's the
compression<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
compression know when you get here it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
compression know when you get here it's
going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.549> easy<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.939> spin<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to be really easy to spin and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.149 
going to be really easy to spin and
that's<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> top<00:01:28.560> dead<00:01:28.770> center<00:01:29.070> on

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that's because it's a top dead center on

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.700 
that's because it's a top dead center on
impressions<00:01:29.700> trouble<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> next<00:01:31.350> step<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
impressions trouble the next step is to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.970 
impressions trouble the next step is to
take<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.100> big<00:01:32.310> 17<00:01:32.880> millimeter<00:01:33.270> wrench

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
take your big 17 millimeter wrench

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.660 
take your big 17 millimeter wrench
and<00:01:35.280> pull<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.470> unscrew<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> tap<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and pull out and unscrew this tap it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.360 
and pull out and unscrew this tap it
cover<00:01:42.920> don't<00:01:43.920> lose<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.190> little<00:01:44.460> oring<00:01:44.760> here

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
cover don't lose this little oring here

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.620 
cover don't lose this little oring here
and<00:01:47.370> you<00:01:47.730> don't<00:01:47.880> need<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> replace<00:01:48.330> its<00:01:48.510> to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
little bit of a little bit of pull on

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
little bit of a little bit of pull on
that<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.990> don't<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.290> mean<00:03:05.440> not<00:03:05.530> pull<00:03:05.740> but<00:03:05.950> a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
little bit of friction and then you put

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.990 
little bit of friction and then you put
this<00:03:10.390> back<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.709> then<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.610> manual<00:03:12.970> says

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
this back on and then the manual says

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.670 
this back on and then the manual says
you<00:03:13.270> gotta<00:03:13.420> torque<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.930> 10<00:03:14.140> foot<00:03:14.350> pounds

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
you gotta torque this to 10 foot pounds

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.860 
you gotta torque this to 10 foot pounds
but<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.520> don't<00:03:15.670> really<00:03:15.760> need<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.150> but<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870

but you don't really need to but the
point<00:03:17.080> I'm<00:03:17.170> making<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.709> don't<00:03:17.890> want

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
point I'm making is that you don't want

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.320 
point I'm making is that you don't want
to<00:03:18.100> over<00:03:18.340> tighten<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.700> because<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.060> doesn't

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
to over tighten it because it doesn't

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.550 
to over tighten it because it doesn't
need<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> be<00:03:19.540> very<00:03:19.810> tight<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.730> just

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
need to be very tight so just

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.550 
need to be very tight so just
so<00:03:24.099> I'm<00:03:24.190> glad<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.489> there<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.959> could<00:03:26.080> make

in the big shop ok now the exhaust side
is<00:03:29.260> exactly<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.800> same<00:03:30.989> he's<00:03:31.989> missing<00:03:32.530> up

make<00:03:35.180> sure<00:03:35.210> that<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.600> engine<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.870> still<00:03:36.080> at

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
make sure that the engine is still at

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.550 
make sure that the engine is still at
top<00:03:36.350> dead<00:03:36.530> center<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.670> don't<00:03:37.820> want<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.560> they

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
top dead center you don't want it they
