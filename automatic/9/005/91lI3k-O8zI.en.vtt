00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
same the thing that really changes is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.360 
same the thing that really changes is
the<00:02:08.599> outer<00:02:08.810> shell<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:11.170> unlike<00:02:12.370> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the outer shell it is unlike the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.130 
the outer shell it is unlike the
evolution<00:02:13.940> which<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.510> almost<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.020> a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
evolution which is so almost like a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.120 
evolution which is so almost like a
shell<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.710> top<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.370> EPS<00:02:16.700> foam<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:18.140> almost

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
shell on top of the EPS foam it's almost

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.330 
shell on top of the EPS foam it's almost
one<00:02:19.250> piece<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:20.390> camera<00:02:20.690> can<00:02:20.870> see<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.950> shell

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
one piece the camera can see the shell

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.020 
one piece the camera can see the shell
and<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:24.230> foam<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.740> one<00:02:25.010> piece

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
and the foam is one piece

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.760 
and the foam is one piece

there's none nothing like that it's
almost<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.290> always<00:02:30.530> looks<00:02:30.740> like<00:02:30.860> it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
almost the always looks like it's

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.720 
almost the always looks like it's
painted<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:32.920> good<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.130> obviously<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
painted on good so obviously the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.970 
painted on good so obviously the
superlight<00:02:35.120> helmet<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.810> much<00:02:36.470> better

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
superlight helmet is a much better

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.310 
superlight helmet is a much better
helmet<00:02:37.460> deal<00:02:37.610> than<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.210> evolution<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.900> terms

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
helmet deal than the evolution in terms

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.000 
helmet deal than the evolution in terms
of<00:02:39.530> lightness<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:41.000> also<00:02:41.180> comes<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.660> premium

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
of lightness it also comes at a premium

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.290 
of lightness it also comes at a premium
slightly<00:02:43.010> more<00:02:43.190> expensive<00:02:43.880> than<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
slightly more expensive than the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.840 
slightly more expensive than the
standard<00:02:44.900> evolution<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.610> know<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
standard evolution but you know the
