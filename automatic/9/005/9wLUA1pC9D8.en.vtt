like melting and working of cities so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.999 
like melting and working of cities so
for<00:01:41.450> me<00:01:41.570> that<00:01:41.780> was<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.110> more<00:01:42.500> interesting

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
for me that was the more interesting

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.389 
for me that was the more interesting
theoretical<00:01:43.759> aspect<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.079> done<00:01:46.009> and

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
theoretical aspect of it and done and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.639 
theoretical aspect of it and done and
then<00:01:47.030> I<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.180> we<00:01:47.479> really<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:48.079> to<00:01:48.229> Marco

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
then I think we really going to Marco

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.710 
then I think we really going to Marco
Polo<00:01:48.890> for<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.250> long<00:01:49.399> time<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.909> I<00:01:50.060> we<00:01:50.600> were

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
Polo for a long time and I we were

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.770 
Polo for a long time and I we were
trying<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:50.960> figure<00:01:51.110> out<00:01:51.259> ways<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.560> make<00:01:51.950> that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
trying to figure out ways to make that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.780

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
yeah yeah i think i'm part of the idea

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.160 
yeah yeah i think i'm part of the idea
there<00:03:05.750> too<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.230> good<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:08.420> Venice

one<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.569> was<00:03:33.690> when<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.930> realized<00:03:34.080> we

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
one so so that was when we realized we

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.199 
one so so that was when we realized we
had<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.709> make<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.920> screens<00:03:35.190> appear<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
had to make the screens appear and

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.430 
had to make the screens appear and
disappear<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:37.019> then<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.920> kind<00:03:39.440> coalesced

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
disappear and then that kind coalesced

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.930 
disappear and then that kind coalesced
into<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.830> idea<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.250> network<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
into that idea of the network that the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.089 
into that idea of the network that the
network<00:03:42.150> would<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.380> way<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
network would just be the way that the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.300 
network would just be the way that the
world<00:03:44.840> reconfigured<00:03:45.840> itself<00:03:46.200> around<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
world reconfigured itself around a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.949 
world reconfigured itself around a
character<00:03:47.670> depending<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.599> situation<00:03:50.959> the

character depending on the situation the
buddhist<00:03:52.260> association<00:03:52.440> who<00:03:53.069> created<00:03:53.489> the

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
buddhist association who created the

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.509 
buddhist association who created the
piece<00:03:53.760> they<00:03:54.150> developed<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.810> website<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.530> is

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
piece they developed a website that is

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.370 
piece they developed a website that is
going<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.060> work<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.390> conjunction<00:03:57.569> with<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
going to work in conjunction with the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.350 
going to work in conjunction with the
performance<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:58.890> continuous<00:03:59.370> city<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.790> it's

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
performance of continuous city and it's

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.380 
performance of continuous city and it's
the<00:04:01.019> site<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:01.650> azubu<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:03.150> entire

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the site for azubu the entire

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.660 
the site for azubu the entire
performance<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> conceit<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.670> this

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
performance is a conceit that this

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.300 
performance is a conceit that this
social<00:04:06.120> networking<00:04:06.420> site<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.720> also<00:04:06.900> launched

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
social networking site is also launched

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.059 
social networking site is also launched
so<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.269> real<00:04:09.450> world<00:04:09.660> zoo<00:04:10.349> brew<00:04:10.470> exists<00:04:10.920> as

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
so in the real world zoo brew exists as

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.000 
so in the real world zoo brew exists as
a<00:04:11.130> site<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.450> can<00:04:12.690> go<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.260> record<00:04:13.920> a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
a site that you can go to and record a

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.000 
a site that you can go to and record a
30-second<00:04:14.579> video<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:16.769> send<00:04:16.919> to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
love that kind of stuff and we set up

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.990 
love that kind of stuff and we set up
zooboo<00:04:27.840> hubs<00:04:28.050> at<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.740> couple<00:04:29.160> key<00:04:29.490> locations<00:04:29.910> on

zooboo hubs at a couple key locations on
campus<00:04:30.120> we<00:04:30.510> set<00:04:30.660> them<00:04:30.750> up<00:04:30.870> in<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.710> campus<00:04:31.979> why

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
campus we set them up in the campus why

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.090 
campus we set them up in the campus why
and<00:04:32.490> in<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.389> globe<00:04:33.570> Blood<00:04:33.750> Center<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.139> and

and in the globe Blood Center is and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.310 
and in the globe Blood Center is and
they<00:04:36.060> will<00:04:36.389> incorporate<00:04:36.720> some<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.200> these

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
they will incorporate some of these

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.409 
they will incorporate some of these
videos<00:04:37.530> into<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.100> performance<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.150> if<00:04:39.240> you'd

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
videos into the performance so if you'd

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.000 
videos into the performance so if you'd
record<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.780> video<00:04:39.930> go<00:04:40.260> pumas<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.710> might<00:04:40.830> see

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
record a video go pumas you might see
