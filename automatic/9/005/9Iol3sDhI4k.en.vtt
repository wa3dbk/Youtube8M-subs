do<00:02:18.760> basically<00:02:19.540> two<00:02:19.780> dealers<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:21.340> went

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
do basically two dealers they went

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.460 
do basically two dealers they went
through<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.910> taste<00:02:22.180> verified<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.960> so<00:02:23.350> they

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
through the taste verified it so they

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.110 
through the taste verified it so they
said<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:23.770> got<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.980> reconstruct<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.760> hand<00:02:24.970> we

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
said we got to reconstruct the hand we

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.340 
said we got to reconstruct the hand we
don't<00:02:25.330> know<00:02:25.480> what<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> other<00:02:25.990> players

we're gonna give him his hand and we're

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.000 
we're gonna give him his hand and we're
gonna<00:02:30.850> reconstruct<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.900> all<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.500> draw

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
gonna reconstruct the all in draw

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.040 
gonna reconstruct the all in draw
meanwhile<00:02:33.820> had<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.120> already<00:02:34.480> scooped<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:34.960> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
meanwhile had you already scooped in the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.070 
meanwhile had you already scooped in the
chips<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.680> move<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.540> put<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.660> back<00:02:37.870> out

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
chips and like move on put it back out

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.030 
chips and like move on put it back out
so<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.770> know<00:02:39.700> now<00:02:40.270> I'm<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> math<00:02:40.870> guy<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.440> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so you know now I'm a math guy but you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.310 
so you know now I'm a math guy but you
know<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.400> feels<00:02:42.700> like<00:02:42.850> okay<00:02:43.690> he's<00:02:43.840> got<00:02:43.960> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
know this feels like okay he's got the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.370 
know this feels like okay he's got the
low<00:02:44.500> card<00:02:44.830> now<00:02:45.660> run<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.780> twice<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.170> don't<00:02:47.320> I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
low card now run it twice I don't I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.590 
low card now run it twice I don't I
don't<00:02:47.440> want<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.710> do<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.920> right<00:02:48.130> he<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.450> we

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
don't want to do that right he so we

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.060 
don't want to do that right he so we
reconstruct<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.200> hand<00:02:50.350> he<00:02:50.470> draws<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.920> it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
reconstruct the hand he draws it it

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.560 
reconstruct the hand he draws it it
looks<00:02:51.250> like<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> little<00:02:51.730> card<00:02:51.880> at<00:02:51.940> first<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:52.420> it

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
looks like a little card at first but it

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.540 
looks like a little card at first but it
pairs<00:02:52.840> them<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.770> first<00:02:57.070> time<00:02:57.310> I've

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
pairs them like this is first time I've

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.420 
pairs them like this is first time I've
had<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.910> pay<00:02:58.120> two<00:02:58.480> draws<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:59.260> single<00:03:00.220> draw

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
had to pay two draws in single draw

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.570 
had to pay two draws in single draw
deuces<00:03:01.000> seven<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.020> know<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.459> guys

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
deuces seven so you know and you guys

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.070 
deuces seven so you know and you guys
were<00:03:03.730> able<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.090> really<00:03:04.480> go<00:03:04.750> through<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
were able to really go through the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.620 
were able to really go through the
reconstruction<00:03:05.830> semi<00:03:06.280> well<00:03:07.090> they<00:03:07.330> had<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
reconstruction semi well they had the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.960 
reconstruction semi well they had the
cameras<00:03:08.080> on<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.470> sure<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:09.070> like<00:03:09.280> it's<00:03:09.580> deep<00:03:09.820> in

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
cameras on I'm sure it like it's deep in

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.910 
cameras on I'm sure it like it's deep in
the<00:03:10.000> money<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.540> kind<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.410> tournament

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
the money and just kind of tournament

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.949 
the money and just kind of tournament
right<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.160> guess<00:03:12.610> Dave<00:03:12.850> lamb<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.270> wanted<00:03:13.540> like

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
right I guess Dave lamb just wanted like

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.870 
right I guess Dave lamb just wanted like
I<00:03:14.110> don't<00:03:14.170> know<00:03:14.470> about<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.010> rolling<00:03:15.400> just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
I don't know about the rolling just

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.300 
I don't know about the rolling just
because<00:03:16.300> you<00:03:16.600> know<00:03:16.720> there's<00:03:17.230> some<00:03:17.500> duty<00:03:18.070> that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
because you know there's some duty that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.100 
because you know there's some duty that
the<00:03:18.400> players<00:03:18.670> should<00:03:18.820> protect<00:03:19.180> himself<00:03:19.360> like

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
the players should protect himself like

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.350 
the players should protect himself like
if<00:03:20.320> he<00:03:20.470> had<00:03:20.500> said<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.640> know<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.820> gave<00:03:22.060> me<00:03:22.180> back

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
if he had said you know you gave me back

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
if he had said you know you gave me back
my<00:03:22.390> discard<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.650> know<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:24.400> one<00:03:24.580> right<00:03:25.380> like

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
my discard you know that one right like

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.210 
my discard you know that one right like
what<00:03:26.800> if<00:03:26.980> for<00:03:27.160> example<00:03:27.269> he<00:03:28.590> had<00:03:29.590> discarded<00:03:29.800> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
what if for example he had discarded a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.949 
what if for example he had discarded a
jack<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.760> gotten<00:03:31.090> back<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.660> jack<00:03:32.140> but<00:03:32.980> say<00:03:33.959> he

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
jack and gotten back the jack but say he

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.890 
jack and gotten back the jack but say he
had<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.080> smoother<00:03:35.470> jack<00:03:35.769> than<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.070> did<00:03:36.310> right<00:03:37.269> III

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
had a smoother jack than I did right III

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.930 
had a smoother jack than I did right III
sent<00:03:38.620> out<00:03:38.739> with<00:03:38.860> my<00:03:38.980> Jack<00:03:39.190> he<00:03:39.370> breaks<00:03:39.640> off<00:03:39.790> his

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
sent out with my Jack he breaks off his

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.720 
sent out with my Jack he breaks off his
Jack<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.450> gets<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.750> back

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
Jack and gets it back

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.449 
Jack and gets it back
you<00:03:42.660> know<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.930> don't<00:03:42.989> know<00:03:43.200> obviously<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.370> make

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
you know I don't know obviously to make
