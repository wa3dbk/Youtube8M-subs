00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay so if you've now decided that you

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.970 
okay so if you've now decided that you
there's<00:00:03.629> no<00:00:03.780> chance<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.500> getting<00:00:04.680> into

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
there's no chance of you getting into

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.450 
there's no chance of you getting into
medicine<00:00:06.020> and<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.410> really<00:00:07.770> want<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.309> it

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
medicine and you really want to do it

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.850 
medicine and you really want to do it
and<00:00:08.670> you've<00:00:08.820> decided<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.780> know<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.620> is

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and you've decided that you know this is

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.709 
and you've decided that you know this is
the<00:00:11.099> course<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.090> you're<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.509> for

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the course for you and you're going for

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.250 
the course for you and you're going for
the<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.679> because<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.580> choices

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
the for it because of the right choices

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.470 
the for it because of the right choices
then<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.289> suggest<00:00:16.440> don't<00:00:17.430> panic<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.359> all

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
then I suggest don't panic first of all

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.500 
then I suggest don't panic first of all
don't<00:00:19.080> panic<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.949> too<00:00:20.160> late<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.699> do

don't panic it's not too late to do

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
don't panic it's not too late to do
medicine<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.170> still<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.859> okay<00:00:23.490> it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
medicine you can still do it okay it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.439 
medicine you can still do it okay it's
not<00:00:24.240> too<00:00:24.480> late<00:00:25.519> basically<00:00:26.519> what<00:00:26.849> i<00:00:26.880> suggest

not too late basically what i suggest
the<00:00:27.840> best<00:00:28.109> choice<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> getting

the best choice that you have is getting

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.610 
the best choice that you have is getting
into<00:00:29.970> biomedical<00:00:30.330> science<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.859> remember<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
into biomedical science now remember a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
into biomedical science now remember a
lot<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> people<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.370> biomedical<00:00:36.120> science

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
lot of people in biomedical science

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.069 
lot of people in biomedical science
rethink<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:38.670> initially<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:39.809> wanted

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
rethink that initially think they wanted

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.459 
rethink that initially think they wanted
to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.410> medicine<00:00:41.180> change<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.329> mind<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.200> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
to do medicine change your mind so just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
to do medicine change your mind so just
be<00:00:44.010> careful<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.910> may<00:00:45.149> happen<00:00:45.450> I'm

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
be careful because that may happen I'm

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
be careful because that may happen I'm
not<00:00:46.020> trying<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.559> scare<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.860> i'm<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.370> trying

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
not trying to scare you i'm just trying

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
not trying to scare you i'm just trying
to<00:00:47.760> tell<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.170> happened<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.890> okay

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
to tell you what has happened to me okay

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
to tell you what has happened to me okay
I<00:00:51.690> thought<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> wanted<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.250> medicine<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.969> got

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I thought I wanted to do medicine I got

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.660 
I thought I wanted to do medicine I got
into<00:00:54.570> biomedical<00:00:54.899> science<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> realized

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
into biomedical science then I realized

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
into biomedical science then I realized
in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> second<00:00:57.570> year<00:00:57.600> hey<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
in the second year hey I don't want to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 
in the second year hey I don't want to
do<00:00:59.100> medicine<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.820> don't<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.750> anything

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
do medicine I don't want to do anything

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.600 
do medicine I don't want to do anything
with<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:02.600> just<00:01:03.600> yeah<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.220> health

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
with you know just yeah in the health

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
with you know just yeah in the health
department<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.479> don't<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.990> nothing<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.530> do

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
department I don't want nothing to do

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880 
department I don't want nothing to do
with<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> change<00:01:09.890> courses

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
with it so then I had to change courses

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
with it so then I had to change courses
so<00:01:11.340> first<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.790> changed<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so first I changed over I'm in the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
so first I changed over I'm in the
second<00:01:13.920> year<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> biomedical<00:01:14.700> science<00:01:15.090> i

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
second year of biomedical science i

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
second year of biomedical science i
applied<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.570> architecture<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.710> Melbourne

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
applied for architecture at Melbourne

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.200 
applied for architecture at Melbourne
University<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.450> real<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
University I real I got in but then I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.170 
University I real I got in but then I
realized<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.700> couldn't<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:24.000> bothered

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
realized that I couldn't be bothered

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
realized that I couldn't be bothered
going<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.290> Melbourne<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
going all the way to Melbourne and I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
going all the way to Melbourne and I
didn't<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:26.970> enough<00:01:27.180> good<00:01:27.420> reasons<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> do

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
didn't have enough good reasons to do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.890 
didn't have enough good reasons to do
architecture<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> rethought<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
architecture so then I rethought it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.020 
architecture so then I rethought it
again<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.890> spoke<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> few<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:32.790> dads

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
again and I spoke to a few of my dads

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
again and I spoke to a few of my dads
fam<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.960> dad's<00:01:34.200> friends<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.100> decided<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
fam my dad's friends and I decided that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.940 
fam my dad's friends and I decided that
engineering<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.409> course<00:01:37.710> for

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
engineering would be a good course for

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.760 
engineering would be a good course for
me<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.579> enjoy<00:01:38.729> maths<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.770> traveling

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
me because I enjoy maths and traveling

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.469 
me because I enjoy maths and traveling
and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.100> suppose<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.670> enjoy<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> business

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and I suppose I enjoy the business

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
and I suppose I enjoy the business
aspect<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.079> things<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.500> well<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
aspect of things as well so that was a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.600 
aspect of things as well so that was a
great<00:01:44.430> blend<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.200> mean<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.369> look

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
great blend for me so I mean if I look

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
great blend for me so I mean if I look
back<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.360> 12<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.869> someone<00:01:49.200> would<00:01:49.320> tell<00:01:49.560> me

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
back at you 12 and someone would tell me

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.710 
back at you 12 and someone would tell me
that<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.490> doing<00:01:50.790> engineering<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that I'm going to be doing engineering I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
that I'm going to be doing engineering I
would<00:01:51.840> laugh<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.259> them<00:01:52.409> saying<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> there's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
would laugh at them saying that there's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.340 
would laugh at them saying that there's
no<00:01:53.670> way<00:01:53.880> someone<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.170> do

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
no way someone like me could do

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.899 
no way someone like me could do
engineering<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.250> don't<00:01:56.430> understand

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
engineering because I don't understand

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.749 
engineering because I don't understand
you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.960> how<00:01:58.200> could<00:01:58.409> i<00:01:58.500> ever<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:59.159> really

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
you know like how could i ever do really

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
you know like how could i ever do really
complicated<00:02:00.299> maths<00:02:00.570> i<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:00.960> laugh<00:02:01.140> them<00:02:01.439> out

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
complicated maths i would laugh them out

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.560 
complicated maths i would laugh them out
and<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:02.520> i'm<00:02:02.729> sitting<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.180> doing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and now i'm sitting here doing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
and now i'm sitting here doing
engineering<00:02:04.110> law<00:02:04.530> double<00:02:04.950> degree<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.759> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
engineering law double degree which is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.119 
engineering law double degree which is
completely<00:02:06.329> different<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.530> what<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> first

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
completely different to what I first

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.609 
completely different to what I first
initially<00:02:08.640> thought<00:02:08.879> I'll<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:10.349> not

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
initially thought I'll do and I'm not

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.809 
initially thought I'll do and I'm not
even<00:02:10.649> saying

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
even saying

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.479 
even saying
I<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.299> be<00:02:12.420> doing<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> end<00:02:14.249> of<00:02:14.370> my

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
I will be doing this to the end of my

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.459 
I will be doing this to the end of my
life<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.939> probably<00:02:15.180> change<00:02:15.749> a<00:02:15.930> million<00:02:16.260> times

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
life I probably change a million times

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.470 
life I probably change a million times
so<00:02:16.859> it's<00:02:17.489> really<00:02:17.730> hard<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.209> make<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.359> decision

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so it's really hard to make a decision

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.599 
so it's really hard to make a decision
especially<00:02:19.139> when<00:02:19.590> you're<00:02:19.709> young<00:02:19.739> when<00:02:20.459> you're

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
especially when you're young when you're

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.239 
especially when you're young when you're
17<00:02:21.200> if<00:02:22.200> you're<00:02:22.409> lucky<00:02:22.530> enough<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.129> know

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249 
17 if you're lucky enough to know

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.610 
17 if you're lucky enough to know
initially<00:02:23.519> what<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:23.999> want<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.420> well<00:02:25.230> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
initially what you want to do well you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.399 
initially what you want to do well you
you're<00:02:25.950> really<00:02:26.219> blessed<00:02:26.519> okay<00:02:27.269> because<00:02:27.659> a<00:02:27.930> lot

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
you're really blessed okay because a lot

we all we don't some of us don't even

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.190 
we all we don't some of us don't even
know<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:36.840> we're<00:02:36.959> doing<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.669> just<00:02:39.200> back

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
know what we're doing it so I just back

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.250 
know what we're doing it so I just back
to<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.379> topic<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:41.040> Medicine<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.049> don't

to the topic of Medicine if you don't

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.339 
to the topic of Medicine if you don't
get<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.919> you<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:44.489> go<00:02:44.669> to<00:02:44.730> biomedicine<00:02:45.540> keep<00:02:46.200> in

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
get in you can go to biomedicine keep in

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.020 
get in you can go to biomedicine keep in
mind<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.919> have<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.219> get<00:02:47.370> distinctions

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
mind that you have to get distinctions

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.520 
mind that you have to get distinctions
and<00:02:48.209> high<00:02:48.359> distinctions<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.169> even<00:02:49.409> be

and high distinctions to even be

and high distinctions to even be
considered<00:02:49.560> into<00:02:50.250> medicine<00:02:50.639> now

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
considered into medicine now

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.119 
considered into medicine now
distinctions<00:02:52.079> in<00:02:52.199> the<00:02:52.290> high<00:02:52.439> distinctions<00:02:52.980> at

study it's not the same as VCE so a

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.289 
study it's not the same as VCE so a
distinction<00:03:50.609> is<00:03:51.090> quite<00:03:51.509> a<00:03:51.829> at<00:03:52.829> University<00:03:53.549> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
distinction is quite a at University a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.569 
distinction is quite a at University a
high<00:03:54.659> distinction<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.290> even<00:03:55.590> better<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.489> you

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
high distinction is even better so you

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.369 
high distinction is even better so you
want<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:56.969> achieve<00:03:57.060> high<00:03:57.299> distinctions<00:03:59.269> and

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
want to achieve high distinctions and

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.839 
want to achieve high distinctions and
also<00:04:01.379> if<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.859> want<00:04:01.949> to<00:04:02.099> get<00:04:02.219> into<00:04:02.340> medicine

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
also if you want to get into medicine

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.339 
also if you want to get into medicine
you<00:04:03.209> have<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:03.569> do<00:04:03.719> something<00:04:03.989> called<00:04:04.229> the

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
you have to do something called the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.479 
you have to do something called the
gamsat<00:04:04.859> now<00:04:05.669> the<00:04:05.729> gamsat<00:04:06.769> all<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.829> know<00:04:08.039> about

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
gamsat now the gamsat all I know about

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.479 
gamsat now the gamsat all I know about
it<00:04:08.879> is<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.509> a<00:04:09.689> kind<00:04:10.139> of<00:04:10.229> arm<00:04:10.489> tests

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
it is that it's a kind of arm tests

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.869 
it is that it's a kind of arm tests
tests<00:04:12.329> your<00:04:12.479> knowledge<00:04:13.039> not<00:04:14.039> like<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.639> you

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
tests your knowledge not like the you

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.459 
tests your knowledge not like the you
Matt's<00:04:15.090> not<00:04:15.359> on<00:04:15.509> your<00:04:15.659> IQ<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.349> your

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:16.469 
Matt's not on your IQ and your

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.199 
Matt's not on your IQ and your
communication<00:04:17.250> skills<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.669> that's<00:04:17.849> kind<00:04:18.150> of

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
communication skills and that's kind of

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.599 
communication skills and that's kind of
stuff<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:19.259> gaps<00:04:19.500> are<00:04:19.739> actually<00:04:20.130> tests<00:04:20.519> your

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
stuff the gaps are actually tests your

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.879 
stuff the gaps are actually tests your
knowledge<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:21.090> chemistry<00:04:21.719> you<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.019> sciences

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
knowledge on chemistry you know sciences

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.560 
knowledge on chemistry you know sciences
and<00:04:23.190> things<00:04:23.340> like<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.550> so

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
and things like that so

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.260 
and things like that so
it<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.930> quite<00:04:25.380> an<00:04:25.530> important<00:04:26.010> exam<00:04:26.700> held<00:04:27.030> in

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
it is quite an important exam held in

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.740 
it is quite an important exam held in
March<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.990> think<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:30.180> will<00:04:30.360> determine

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
March I think and that will determine

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.350 
March I think and that will determine
whether<00:04:31.140> or<00:04:31.260> not<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.650> get<00:04:31.890> into<00:04:32.310> medicine<00:04:32.760> now

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
whether or not you get into medicine now

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.780 
whether or not you get into medicine now
you<00:04:34.350> may<00:04:34.560> think<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.920> biomedicine<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.760> a

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
you may think that biomedicine is a

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.140 
you may think that biomedicine is a
waste<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.210> time<00:04:36.270> waster<00:04:36.900> three<00:04:37.200> years<00:04:37.790> well<00:04:38.790> in

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
waste of time waster three years well in

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.330 
waste of time waster three years well in
fact<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.720> isn't<00:04:39.900> because<00:04:40.260> when<00:04:40.890> you<00:04:41.010> finish

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
fact it isn't because when you finish

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.980 
fact it isn't because when you finish
that<00:04:41.370> three<00:04:41.700> years<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:42.000> biomedical<00:04:42.600> science

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
that three years of biomedical science

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.660 
that three years of biomedical science
then<00:04:43.230> you<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.470> apply<00:04:43.680> for<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:44.010> lot<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.250> credit

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
then you can apply for a lot of credit

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.540 
then you can apply for a lot of credit
for<00:04:44.880> medicine<00:04:45.810> course<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.800> really<00:04:47.250> you're

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
for medicine course so really you're

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.330 
for medicine course so really you're
three<00:04:48.330> years<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.690> biomedicine<00:04:49.220> after<00:04:50.220> your

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
three years of biomedicine after your

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.860 
three years of biomedicine after your
three<00:04:50.580> years<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:50.850> biomedicine<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.510> just<00:04:51.720> do

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
three years of biomedicine you just do

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.420 
three years of biomedicine you just do
another<00:04:52.020> four<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.830> half<00:04:52.860> years<00:04:53.280> of

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
another four and a half years of

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.180 
another four and a half years of
medicine<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.230> you<00:04:55.230> graduated<00:04:55.980> you're<00:04:56.160> a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
medicine and you graduated you're a

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
medicine and you graduated you're a
doctor<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:57.330> it's<00:04:57.750> not<00:04:57.900> really<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.470> much

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
doctor so it's not really that much

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.590 
doctor so it's not really that much
dramatically<00:04:59.400> different<00:04:59.640> it's<00:05:00.060> maybe<00:05:00.270> an

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
dramatically different it's maybe an

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.840 
dramatically different it's maybe an
extra<00:05:01.050> two<00:05:01.230> years<00:05:01.530> or<00:05:01.680> something<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:02.250> think

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
extra two years or something I think

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.710 
extra two years or something I think
you're<00:05:02.970> studying<00:05:04.010> and<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.700> mean<00:05:06.090> if<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.690> really

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
you're studying and I mean if you really

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.900 
you're studying and I mean if you really
want<00:05:07.260> to<00:05:07.350> do<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.680> then<00:05:07.710> yes<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.280> is<00:05:08.400> worth<00:05:08.640> it

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
want to do it then yes it is worth it

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.880 
want to do it then yes it is worth it
okay<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.820> just<00:05:11.820> remember<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.630> thing<00:05:12.660> if<00:05:13.200> you

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
okay so just remember one thing if you

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.810 
okay so just remember one thing if you
really<00:05:14.400> want<00:05:14.700> to<00:05:14.880> do<00:05:15.090> medicine<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:17.610> have

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
really want to do medicine and you have

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.170 
really want to do medicine and you have
stuffed<00:05:18.120> up<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:18.480> some<00:05:18.750> way<00:05:18.900> UVC<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:20.580> not<00:05:20.880> too

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
stuffed up in some way UVC it's not too

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.930 
stuffed up in some way UVC it's not too
late<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:21.960> can<00:05:22.140> still<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:23.490> can<00:05:23.670> also

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
late you can still do it you can also

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.050 
late you can still do it you can also
apply<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.510> science<00:05:25.280> okay<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.700> know<00:05:26.760> that

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
apply to science okay and I know that

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.640 
apply to science okay and I know that
people<00:05:27.270> have<00:05:27.540> even<00:05:27.690> gotten<00:05:28.020> into<00:05:28.350> medicine

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
people have even gotten into medicine

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.190 
people have even gotten into medicine
from<00:05:28.890> science<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:29.640> it's<00:05:29.790> not<00:05:30.090> too<00:05:30.480> late<00:05:30.720> okay

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
from science so it's not too late okay

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.680 
from science so it's not too late okay
if<00:05:31.470> you<00:05:31.950> really<00:05:32.550> want<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.850> do<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.060> particular

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
if you really want to do a particular

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.530 
if you really want to do a particular
course<00:05:34.230> don't<00:05:34.830> give<00:05:35.100> up<00:05:35.280> on<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.490> keep<00:05:35.880> on<00:05:36.030> going

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
course don't give up on it keep on going

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.440 
course don't give up on it keep on going
for<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.830> worst<00:05:38.100> thing<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.490> do<00:05:38.820> is<00:05:39.060> just<00:05:39.090> to

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
for it the worst thing to do is just to

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.690 
for it the worst thing to do is just to
give<00:05:39.690> up<00:05:39.840> upon<00:05:40.170> your<00:05:40.350> goal<00:05:40.590> because<00:05:41.100> it's<00:05:41.370> hard

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
give up upon your goal because it's hard

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.180 
give up upon your goal because it's hard
after<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.240> it's<00:05:42.690> hard<00:05:43.020> during<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.380> VCE<00:05:43.860> or

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
after the it's hard during the VCE or

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.880 
after the it's hard during the VCE or
something<00:05:44.610> don't<00:05:45.450> let<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:45.780> stop<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.710> can

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
something don't let it stop you you can
