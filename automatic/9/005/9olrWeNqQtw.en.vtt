the<00:02:58.200> first<00:02:58.470> guy<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.040> probably<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> best

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the further back you go on the inside

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.690 
the further back you go on the inside
line<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.990> think<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> more<00:03:07.590> challenging<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.460> she

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
