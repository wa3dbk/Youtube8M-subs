so<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.540> want<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.750> find<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.140> most<00:00:38.380> distal

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
so you want to find the most distal

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.680 
so you want to find the most distal
point<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.430> recovery<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.090> work<00:00:40.510> your<00:00:40.630> way

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
point of recovery and work your way

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.350 
point of recovery and work your way
backwards<00:00:40.989> so<00:00:41.380> if<00:00:41.980> we<00:00:42.610> had<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.820> previous<00:00:43.090> injury

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
any discomfort and then going to ask

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.650 
any discomfort and then going to ask
them<00:04:54.220> well<00:04:54.640> I've<00:04:54.790> got<00:04:54.850> my<00:04:55.090> son<00:04:55.300> they're<00:04:55.510> not

yeah<00:05:12.250> you're<00:05:12.400> going<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.580> see<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.910> kind<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.360> a

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
yeah you're going to see that kind of a

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.530 
yeah you're going to see that kind of a
exam<00:05:14.620> right<00:05:15.250> now<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.490> fingers<00:05:15.910> locked<00:05:16.210> and

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
exam right now the fingers locked and

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.570 
exam right now the fingers locked and
it's<00:05:16.870> probably<00:05:17.200> abided<00:05:17.680> by<00:05:17.710> my<00:05:17.980> thumb<00:05:18.250> putting

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
it's probably abided by my thumb putting

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.580 
it's probably abided by my thumb putting
pressure<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.120> pulley<00:05:19.540> if<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.140> then<00:05:20.380> give<00:05:20.560> a

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
pressure on that pulley if I then give a

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.740 
pressure on that pulley if I then give a
little<00:05:20.830> forceful<00:05:21.160> pull<00:05:21.730> on<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.330> unlocks

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
little forceful pull on it it unlocks

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.630 
little forceful pull on it it unlocks
with<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.290> sim<00:05:23.620> all<00:05:23.980> right<00:05:24.100> that's<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.370> trigger

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
with a sim all right that's a trigger
