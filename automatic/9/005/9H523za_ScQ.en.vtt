now<00:00:00.210> we're<00:00:00.390> going<00:00:00.480> to<00:00:00.570> talk<00:00:00.780> about<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.170> sun's

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
now we're going to talk about the sun's

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.889 
now we're going to talk about the sun's
photosphere<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.730> photosphere<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.629> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
photosphere the photosphere is the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.809 
photosphere the photosphere is the
visible<00:00:04.410> layer<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.890> Sun<00:00:05.100> when<00:00:05.670> you're

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
visible layer of the Sun when you're

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.550 
visible layer of the Sun when you're
looking<00:00:06.029> at<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> Sun<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.569> again<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> don't

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
looking at the Sun and again I don't

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.960 
looking at the Sun and again I don't
recommend<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.189> look<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.519> Sun<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
recommend you look at the Sun with the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.490 
recommend you look at the Sun with the
naked<00:00:09.090> eye<00:00:09.450> without<00:00:09.719> any<00:00:09.900> protection<00:00:10.260> you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
naked eye without any protection you

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.049 
naked eye without any protection you
want<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.710> have<00:00:10.889> special<00:00:11.370> filters<00:00:11.790> when<00:00:11.969> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
want to have special filters when you

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.490 
want to have special filters when you
look<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> Sun<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.110> when<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.380> take

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
look at the Sun and when we take

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.110 
look at the Sun and when we take
pictures<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.099> Sun<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.610> able<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.880> look

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
pictures of the Sun are we able to look

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.939 
pictures of the Sun are we able to look
at<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> Sun<00:00:15.509> through<00:00:15.540> special<00:00:16.080> filters<00:00:16.470> we

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
at the Sun through special filters we

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.040 
at the Sun through special filters we
see<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> surface<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> Sun<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
see the surface of the Sun and the

being<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> atmosphere<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.890> Sun<00:00:35.100> which

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
being in the atmosphere of the Sun which

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.130 
being in the atmosphere of the Sun which
is<00:00:35.370> called<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> chromosphere<00:00:36.090> milk<00:00:36.809> will

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is called the chromosphere milk will

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569 
is called the chromosphere milk will
talk<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.710> chromosphere<00:00:37.920> later

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
talk about the chromosphere later

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
talk about the chromosphere later
now<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> photosphere<00:00:39.840> even<00:00:40.350> though<00:00:40.440> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
now the photosphere even though it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
now the photosphere even though it's
still<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> physical<00:00:41.430> limit<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> Sun<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
still the physical limit of the Sun the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
still the physical limit of the Sun the
physical<00:00:42.719> serves<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> Sun<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.950> denser<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
physical serves the Sun the denser the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330 
physical serves the Sun the denser the
sort<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.239> photosphere<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:46.079> much<00:00:46.890> less

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
sort of the photosphere is much less

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.850 
sort of the photosphere is much less
dense<00:00:47.670> than<00:00:47.879> Earth's<00:00:48.059> atmosphere<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
dense than Earth's atmosphere and so the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.660 
dense than Earth's atmosphere and so the
density<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> photosphere<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:52.670> very

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
density of the photosphere is very very

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
density of the photosphere is very very
tenuous<00:00:54.440> compared<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> Earth's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
tenuous compared to the Earth's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.479 
tenuous compared to the Earth's
atmosphere

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
atmosphere

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
atmosphere
it's<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:58.250> 0.01%<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> density<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's about 0.01% the density of the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
it's about 0.01% the density of the
Earth's<00:01:02.340> atmosphere<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.840> imagine

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
Earth's atmosphere so you can imagine

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
Earth's atmosphere so you can imagine
it's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:05.040> dense<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.060> hard<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it's not very dense so it's hard to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's not very dense so it's hard to
imagine<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.229> photosphere<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:08.040> being<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
imagine of the photosphere as being the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
imagine of the photosphere as being the
surface<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> Sun<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> remember

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
surface the Sun but you have to remember

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
surface the Sun but you have to remember
that<00:01:10.979> by<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.760> reads<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.150> outer

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that by the time it reads the outer

that by the time it reads the outer
layers<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> Sun<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.890> Sun<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.400> very

surface<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.220> photosphere<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.880> very

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
surface because the photosphere is very

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.280 
surface because the photosphere is very
opaque<00:01:46.310> when<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.460> pen<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> starting<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> give

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
opaque when my pen is starting to give

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.310 
opaque when my pen is starting to give
out<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.649> me<00:01:49.680> opaque<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.659> opaque<00:01:51.990> mean

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
out on me opaque so what is opaque mean

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.090 
out on me opaque so what is opaque mean
opaque<00:01:53.130> means<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.470> penetrable<00:01:55.470> by

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
opaque means that it's not penetrable by

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.179 
opaque means that it's not penetrable by
visible<00:01:56.640> light<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.630> any<00:01:57.960> light<00:01:58.710> coming<00:01:59.159> from

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
visible light so any light coming from

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
visible light so any light coming from
the<00:01:59.640> interior<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> Sun<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.930> tries<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the interior of the Sun that tries to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.230 
the interior of the Sun that tries to
make<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> Sun<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> gets

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
make it out of the Sun kind of gets

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
make it out of the Sun kind of gets
blocked<00:02:03.600> by<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> photosphere<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.280> what

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
blocked by the photosphere so what

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
blocked by the photosphere so what
happens<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> photosphere<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
happens there is that the photosphere is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.040 
happens there is that the photosphere is
at<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> temperature<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> roughly<00:02:09.020> 5800<00:02:10.020> Kelvin

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
at a temperature of roughly 5800 Kelvin

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.589 
at a temperature of roughly 5800 Kelvin
which<00:02:11.039> causes<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
which causes the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.780 
which causes the
the<00:02:12.749> hydrogen<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.920> photosphere<00:02:14.370> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
the hydrogen in the photosphere to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.239 
the hydrogen in the photosphere to
sometimes<00:02:15.239> acquire<00:02:15.840> an<00:02:16.170> additional<00:02:16.829> electron

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.249 
sometimes acquire an additional electron

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.500 
sometimes acquire an additional electron
sometimes<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.879> gets<00:02:17.999> stripped<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.420> its

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
sometimes it gets stripped of its

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
sometimes it gets stripped of its
electrons<00:02:19.079> sometimes<00:02:19.469> it<00:02:19.620> requires<00:02:19.920> an

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
electrons sometimes it requires an

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.989 
electrons sometimes it requires an
additional<00:02:20.340> electron<00:02:20.969> and<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.239> when<00:02:22.109> hydrogen

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:22.999 
additional electron and so when hydrogen

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.270 
additional electron and so when hydrogen
ends<00:02:23.999> up<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.510> an<00:02:24.989> additional<00:02:25.620> electron<00:02:26.040> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
ends up with an additional electron it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.759 
ends up with an additional electron it
is<00:02:26.400> now<00:02:26.579> negatively<00:02:27.329> charged<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:28.739> has

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
is now negatively charged so it now has

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.580 
is now negatively charged so it now has
two<00:02:29.400> electrons<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.359> those<00:02:30.840> two<00:02:31.049> electrons

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
two electrons and those two electrons

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.649 
two electrons and those two electrons
play<00:02:32.040> havoc<00:02:32.549> with<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.819> photons<00:02:33.299> trying<00:02:33.599> to

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
play havoc with the photons trying to

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.390 
play havoc with the photons trying to
make<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.959> through<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.200> photosphere<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:35.069> tends

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
make it through the photosphere it tends

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.089 
make it through the photosphere it tends
to<00:02:35.549> absorb<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.959> these<00:02:37.170> hydrogens<00:02:37.739> tend<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
to absorb so these hydrogens tend to

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.610 
to absorb so these hydrogens tend to
absorb<00:02:38.219> the<00:02:38.879> radiations<00:02:39.569> coming<00:02:39.659> from<00:02:40.109> inside

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
absorb the radiations coming from inside

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.580 
absorb the radiations coming from inside
the<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.669> Sun<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.629> strip<00:02:43.049> that<00:02:43.230> extra<00:02:43.530> electron

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the the Sun to strip that extra electron

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.800 
the the Sun to strip that extra electron
away<00:02:44.069> from<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.370> hydrogen<00:02:44.730> causes<00:02:45.659> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
away from the hydrogen causes the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.110 
away from the hydrogen causes the
electron<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.829> photon<00:02:47.219> to<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.519> scattered<00:02:47.969> out

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
electron the photon to be scattered out

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
electron the photon to be scattered out
and<00:02:48.329> then<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.019> then<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.919> electron<00:02:52.919> will

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and then the then the the electron will

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
and then the then the the electron will
then<00:02:53.189> reunite<00:02:53.760> with<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> hydrogen<00:02:54.359> making<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
then reunite with a hydrogen making it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.809 
then reunite with a hydrogen making it
negative<00:02:55.169> again<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:56.459> will<00:02:56.609> then

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
negative again and that will then

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.209 
negative again and that will then
release<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> photon<00:02:58.019> by<00:02:58.469> again<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.680> photon

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
release a photon by again the photon

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.559 
release a photon by again the photon
will<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.609> released<00:02:59.849> in<00:03:00.060> two<00:03:00.150> random

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
will then be released in two random

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.569 
will then be released in two random
directions<00:03:00.689> so<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.739> radiation<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.370> came

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
directions so the radiation that came

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.539 
directions so the radiation that came
from<00:03:02.760> inside<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.959> Sun<00:03:04.409> will<00:03:05.040> get<00:03:05.219> scattered

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
from inside the Sun will get scattered

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.159 
from inside the Sun will get scattered
and<00:03:05.939> bounced<00:03:06.359> around<00:03:06.480> inside<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
and bounced around inside the

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.259 
and bounced around inside the
photosphere<00:03:07.500> before<00:03:08.069> leaves<00:03:08.370> which<00:03:08.969> makes

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
photosphere before leaves which makes

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.869 
photosphere before leaves which makes
the<00:03:09.389> photosphere<00:03:09.780> very<00:03:10.319> opaque<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.549> wasn't

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
the photosphere very opaque if it wasn't

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.459 
the photosphere very opaque if it wasn't
for<00:03:11.969> a<00:03:12.030> fact<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.599> photosphere<00:03:13.079> does

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
for a fact that the photosphere does

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.220 
for a fact that the photosphere does
that<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:14.099> could<00:03:14.310> actually<00:03:14.489> look<00:03:14.909> deep<00:03:15.750> into

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
that we could actually look deep into

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.080 
that we could actually look deep into
the<00:03:16.590> interior<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.189> Sun<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:17.909> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the interior of the Sun because the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.569 
the interior of the Sun because the
convection<00:03:18.750> zone<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:19.169> not<00:03:19.439> opaque<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.159> so<00:03:20.459> we

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
convection zone is not opaque and so we

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.399 
convection zone is not opaque and so we
should<00:03:20.759> be<00:03:20.939> able<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.269> look<00:03:21.540> right<00:03:22.019> into<00:03:22.229> the

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
should be able to look right into the

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.559 
should be able to look right into the
Sun<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.009> the<00:03:23.189> photosphere<00:03:23.609> because<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.449> its

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
Sun so the photosphere because of its

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.379 
Sun so the photosphere because of its
nature<00:03:24.829> causes<00:03:25.829> that<00:03:25.979> physical<00:03:26.849> visual

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
nature causes that physical visual

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.270 
nature causes that physical visual
boundary<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.169> Sun<00:03:28.409> that<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.709> cannot<00:03:29.040> look

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
boundary of the Sun that we cannot look

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.309 
boundary of the Sun that we cannot look
beyond<00:03:29.669> we<00:03:30.090> cannot<00:03:30.359> physically<00:03:30.900> see<00:03:31.109> any

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
beyond we cannot physically see any

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.740 
beyond we cannot physically see any
light<00:03:31.500> beyond<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.609> photosphere<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.599> we're

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
light beyond the photosphere so we're

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.479 
light beyond the photosphere so we're
limited<00:03:34.139> in<00:03:34.290> our<00:03:34.500> ability<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:34.919> look<00:03:35.040> into<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
limited in our ability to look into the

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.159 
limited in our ability to look into the
Sun<00:03:35.639> because<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.599> that's<00:03:36.959> what

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
Sun because of that and that's what
