so<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.140> first<00:00:29.380> thing<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:29.740> see<00:00:30.010> is<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.250> banshees

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
so the first thing we see is a banshees

so the first thing we see is a banshees
assault<00:00:31.390> on<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.600> pelican<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.710> banshee<00:00:33.130> looks<00:00:33.400> a

assault on a pelican the banshee looks a
little<00:00:33.880> bit<00:00:34.150> different<00:00:34.600> than<00:00:34.900> recent

iterations<00:00:35.830> I<00:00:36.010> have<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.370> say<00:00:36.550> however<00:00:37.150> what

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
iterations I have to say however what

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.240 
iterations I have to say however what
caught<00:00:37.840> everyone's<00:00:38.410> eye<00:00:38.680> was<00:00:39.100> the

caught everyone's eye was the
interesting<00:00:39.580> designs<00:00:40.239> on<00:00:40.570> it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
interesting designs on it

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.049 
interesting designs on it
could<00:00:41.470> this<00:00:41.590> Banshee<00:00:42.040> belong<00:00:42.400> to<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.760> storm

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
could this Banshee belong to the storm

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.630 
could this Banshee belong to the storm
faction<00:00:43.630> or<00:00:43.809> perhaps<00:00:44.470> an<00:00:44.830> entirely<00:00:45.220> new

somewhere else he grabs his battle rifle
which<00:00:53.830> could<00:00:54.100> be<00:00:54.250> symbolic<00:00:54.580> for<00:00:55.000> picking

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
which could be symbolic for picking

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.509 
which could be symbolic for picking
loadouts<00:00:55.809> he<00:00:56.260> has<00:00:56.379> seen<00:00:56.650> then<00:00:56.920> dropping<00:00:57.400> into

this<00:00:57.730> landscape<00:00:58.059> into<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:58.840> city<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.830> makes<00:01:00.040> me

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
this landscape into the city it makes me

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.490 
this landscape into the city it makes me
wonder<00:01:00.460> what<00:01:01.150> if<00:01:01.269> this<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:01.629> based<00:01:01.900> off<00:01:02.110> time<00:01:02.350> a

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
wonder what if this is based off time a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.280 
wonder what if this is based off time a
mission<00:01:02.979> or<00:01:03.250> how<00:01:03.790> agent<00:01:04.269> lock<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.659> dispatched

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
mission or how agent lock is dispatched

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.980 
mission or how agent lock is dispatched
into<00:01:05.770> missions<00:01:06.130> maybe<00:01:06.790> every<00:01:07.240> mission<00:01:07.600> with<00:01:07.780> a

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
into missions maybe every mission with a

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.080 
into missions maybe every mission with a
chola<00:01:08.380> key<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.740> dropped<00:01:09.130> into<00:01:09.370> battle<00:01:10.060> like

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
chola key is dropped into battle like

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.420 
chola key is dropped into battle like
this<00:01:10.450> after<00:01:10.840> picking<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.320> loadout<00:01:11.710> any<00:01:12.040> who

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
this after picking a loadout any who

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.789 
this after picking a loadout any who
like<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.150> said<00:01:13.360> in<00:01:13.450> my<00:01:13.570> last<00:01:13.720> video<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.740> is

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
like I said in my last video this is

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.430 
like I said in my last video this is
most<00:01:15.280> likely<00:01:15.400> sangai<00:01:16.210> Leo's<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.990> home<00:01:17.170> planet

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
most likely sangai Leo's the home planet

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.210 
most likely sangai Leo's the home planet
of<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:18.040> sengh<00:01:18.250> le<00:01:18.490> aka<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.750> elites

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
of the sengh le aka the elites

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.859 
of the sengh le aka the elites
regardless<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.400> where<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.270> it's

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
regardless of where this is it's

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.600 
regardless of where this is it's
believed<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.680> have<00:01:23.799> seen<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.190> multiple

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
believed that we have seen it multiple

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.660 
believed that we have seen it multiple
times<00:01:24.670> from<00:01:25.240> art<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.380> e3<00:01:26.950> trailer<00:01:26.979> and

times from art to the e3 trailer and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.270 
times from art to the e3 trailer and
even<00:01:28.150> some<00:01:28.390> cover<00:01:28.720> art<00:01:29.049> wherever<00:01:29.740> Locke<00:01:30.040> is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
even some cover art wherever Locke is

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.219 
even some cover art wherever Locke is
this<00:01:30.880> place<00:01:31.210> definitely<00:01:31.479> holds<00:01:32.080> some

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
this place definitely holds some

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.980 
this place definitely holds some
importance<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.009> Halo<00:01:33.219> 5<00:01:33.670> now<00:01:34.240> we<00:01:34.270> see<00:01:34.689> lock

importance to Halo 5 now we see lock

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.010 
importance to Halo 5 now we see lock

acting like a normal sparks and he is

going way faster now we know Spartans

going way faster now we know Spartans
are<00:01:48.310> badass<00:01:48.969> by<00:01:49.240> default<00:01:49.719> but<00:01:49.990> agent<00:01:50.740> Locke

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
are badass by default but agent Locke

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.200 
are badass by default but agent Locke
seems<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.939> be<00:01:52.030> going<00:01:52.390> super<00:01:53.049> fast<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.829> super

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
seems to be going super fast and super

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.200 
seems to be going super fast and super
quick<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:56.500> just<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.100> almost<00:01:57.429> too<00:01:57.820> hard<00:01:58.030> to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
quick and it just is almost too hard to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.910 
quick and it just is almost too hard to
follow<00:01:58.420> that's<00:01:59.020> why<00:01:59.140> we<00:01:59.289> need<00:01:59.469> breakdowns

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
follow that's why we need breakdowns

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.239 
follow that's why we need breakdowns
like<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:02.170> does<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.740> possibly

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
like this so what does this possibly

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.730 
like this so what does this possibly
mean<00:02:03.369> could<00:02:03.939> it<00:02:03.969> just<00:02:04.240> be<00:02:04.479> an<00:02:04.719> effect<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.469> make

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
mean could it just be an effect to make

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.950 
mean could it just be an effect to make
the<00:02:06.009> trailer<00:02:06.429> look<00:02:06.759> more<00:02:07.060> amped<00:02:07.539> up<00:02:07.630> to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the trailer look more amped up to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.950 
the trailer look more amped up to
advertise<00:02:08.800> better<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.399> make<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.759> make<00:02:10.450> heel<00:02:10.690> 5

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
advertise better to make it make heel 5

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.990 
advertise better to make it make heel 5
seem<00:02:11.290> more<00:02:11.470> exciting<00:02:12.130> than<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.490> really<00:02:12.670> is

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
seem more exciting than it really is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.820 
seem more exciting than it really is
because<00:02:13.600> no<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.020> would<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.319> able<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.590> follow

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
because no one would be able to follow

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.130 
because no one would be able to follow
along<00:02:15.220> without<00:02:15.819> having<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.360> stroke<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.990> it

could it be an actual ability or

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
on the banjee why this trailer seems

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.470 
on the banjee why this trailer seems
very<00:02:41.260> cool<00:02:41.620> we<00:02:41.770> can't<00:02:42.010> quite<00:02:42.310> tell<00:02:42.610> what<00:02:43.360> it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
very cool we can't quite tell what it

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.060 
very cool we can't quite tell what it
might<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.780> hinting<00:02:44.020> at<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.650> said<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.890> moment

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
might be hinting at like I said a moment

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.280 
might be hinting at like I said a moment
ago<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.240> an<00:02:46.390> effete<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.930> viewers

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
ago is it just an effete for the viewers

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.650 
ago is it just an effete for the viewers
or<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.160> hinting<00:02:48.550> at<00:02:48.670> something<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.390> take

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
or is it hinting at something so take

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.270 
or is it hinting at something so take
this<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.020> grain<00:02:50.080> of<00:02:50.260> salt<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:51.100> it's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
this with a grain of salt but it's

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.850 
this with a grain of salt but it's
possible<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.850> we<00:02:52.000> have<00:02:52.210> a<00:02:52.390> lock<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.990> boarding

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
possible that we have a lock on boarding

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.490 
possible that we have a lock on boarding
which<00:02:54.220> basically<00:02:54.700> means<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.300> maybe<00:02:56.170> if<00:02:56.350> you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
which basically means that maybe if you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.420 
which basically means that maybe if you
look<00:02:56.710> at<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> banshee

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
look at a banshee

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.880 
look at a banshee
it<00:02:57.580> locks<00:02:58.180> on<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.750> then<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.200> thrust

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
it locks on and then you can thrust

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.940 
it locks on and then you can thrust
towards<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.780> board<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.960> or<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.800> any

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
towards it and board it or for any

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.430 
towards it and board it or for any
vehicle<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:03.910> matter<00:03:04.240> anyways<00:03:05.140> that's

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
vehicle for that matter anyways that's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.590 
vehicle for that matter anyways that's
just<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.740> speculation<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.430> came<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.790> with<00:03:07.000> he

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
just a speculation I came up with he

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.570 
just a speculation I came up with he
crashes<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.140> Banshee<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.710> lands<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.400> in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
crashes the Banshee and lands like in

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.460 
crashes the Banshee and lands like in
the<00:03:09.670> ground<00:03:09.910> pound<00:03:10.150> position<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.110> Banshee

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
the ground pound position the Banshee

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.370 
the ground pound position the Banshee
takes<00:03:11.710> off<00:03:11.950> he<00:03:12.400> sprints<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.090> actually<00:03:13.810> slams

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
takes off he sprints and actually slams

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.530 
takes off he sprints and actually slams
into<00:03:14.710> it<00:03:14.950> much<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.430> another<00:03:15.610> ability<00:03:16.120> in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
into it much like another ability in

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.350 
into it much like another ability in
Halo<00:03:16.900> 5<00:03:17.200> sparks<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.130> charge<00:03:18.400> at<00:03:18.760> first<00:03:19.240> I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
Halo 5 sparks in charge at first I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.600 
Halo 5 sparks in charge at first I
thought<00:03:19.540> he'd<00:03:19.720> kicked<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:20.740> no<00:03:20.920> he<00:03:21.310> slimed

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
thought he'd kicked it but no he slimed

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.730 
thought he'd kicked it but no he slimed
into<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.240> a<00:03:22.270> charge<00:03:22.630> needless<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.710> say

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
into it like a charge needless to say

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.820 
into it like a charge needless to say

the Banshee Goes Down walk uses another

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.100 
the Banshee Goes Down walk uses another
ability<00:03:27.430> which<00:03:27.790> if<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.150> remember<00:03:28.300> helps

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
ability which if you remember helps

Spartans<00:03:29.560> up<00:03:29.770> on<00:03:30.010> ledges<00:03:30.550> right<00:03:31.060> now<00:03:31.240> it<00:03:31.480> looks

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
Spartans up on ledges right now it looks

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.780 
Spartans up on ledges right now it looks
like<00:03:31.810> agent<00:03:32.110> Locke<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> bit<00:03:32.920> juiced<00:03:33.220> up<00:03:33.520> and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
like agent Locke is a bit juiced up and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.670 
like agent Locke is a bit juiced up and
like<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.150> said<00:03:34.210> previously<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:35.140> could<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.500> be

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
like I said previously it could just be

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.740 
like I said previously it could just be
an<00:03:35.770> effect<00:03:36.130> for<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.670> trailer<00:03:37.090> itself<00:03:37.480> or

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
an effect for the trailer itself or

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.900 
an effect for the trailer itself or
maybe<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.380> special<00:03:39.010> ability<00:03:39.430> or<00:03:39.610> something

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
maybe a special ability or something

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.090 
maybe a special ability or something
that<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:40.180> obtain<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.900> game<00:03:41.110> but<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:41.860> looks

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
that we obtain in the game but it looks

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.850 
that we obtain in the game but it looks
like<00:03:42.340> his<00:03:42.580> clamper<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.330> much<00:03:44.110> more<00:03:44.470> effective

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
like his clamper is much more effective

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.610 
like his clamper is much more effective
maybe<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:46.630> campaign<00:03:47.170> we

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
maybe this is just for campaign we

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.500 
maybe this is just for campaign we

radius is just enormous now this could
be<00:04:21.250> because<00:04:21.430> he<00:04:22.000> saw<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.450> grenade<00:04:22.840> rolling<00:04:23.260> and

that's<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:34.360> some<00:04:34.480> speculation<00:04:35.140> but<00:04:35.320> there

that's just some speculation but there

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.950

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
was a frame of a grenade and it looked

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.170 
was a frame of a grenade and it looked
like<00:04:38.110> agent<00:04:38.560> Locke<00:04:38.770> had<00:04:39.250> his<00:04:39.400> eye<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:40.000> into

like agent Locke had his eye on it into

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.870 
like agent Locke had his eye on it into
the<00:04:40.419> ground<00:04:40.720> pound<00:04:41.020> on<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.260> but<00:04:42.010> again<00:04:42.640> just

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the ground pound on it but again just
