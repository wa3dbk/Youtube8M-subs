who's a very very good player upgraded

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670 
who's a very very good player upgraded
to<00:01:14.220> gold<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.240> game<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.810> he<00:01:16.560> was

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to gold now in this game and he was

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.289 
to gold now in this game and he was
going<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:16.920> quite<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> bit<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.880> he's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
going for quite a bit now I think he's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.570 
going for quite a bit now I think he's
quite<00:01:18.840> easy<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:19.560> he<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.830> only<00:01:20.009> 75

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
quite easy to get because he was only 75

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.910 
quite easy to get because he was only 75
raid<00:01:21.240> player<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.710> he's<00:01:22.830> probably

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
raid player and I think he's probably

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.499 
raid player and I think he's probably
only<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> couple<00:01:23.970> k<00:01:24.299> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
only going to go for a couple k but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
only going to go for a couple k but
still<00:01:24.750> best<00:01:25.200> player<00:01:25.439> we've<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.009> far<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
still best player we've got so far it's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.450 
still best player we've got so far it's
a<00:01:26.729> shiny<00:01:27.000> player<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.619> can't<00:01:28.920> complain<00:01:29.250> it's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
a shiny player so we can't complain it's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.520 
a shiny player so we can't complain it's
a<00:01:29.520> half-decent<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
a half-decent one at that and this is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.080 
a half-decent one at that and this is
another<00:01:31.680> reason<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.670> keeping<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
another reason I'm not keeping the

contracts just trade poles for then it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
contracts just trade poles for then it

and think I keep keeping the other stuff

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
and think I keep keeping the other stuff
like<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.030> stadiums<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> ball<00:02:57.990> because

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
like the stadiums and the ball because

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.440 
like the stadiums and the ball because
you<00:02:58.830> know<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.460> discard<00:02:59.760> them<00:03:00.000> later<00:03:00.210> or

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
you know you can discard them later or

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.080 
you know you can discard them later or
sell<00:03:00.660> them<00:03:00.690> off<00:03:01.020> later<00:03:01.230> issue<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.920> wish<00:03:02.190> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
sell them off later issue so wish I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.840

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
do it so I basically try again and then

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.860 
do it so I basically try again and then
discard<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.200> rest<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.860> pack<00:03:14.510> go<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.660> to
