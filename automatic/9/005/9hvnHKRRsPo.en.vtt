00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.990
 for everyone welcome to my kitchen a 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.690
 server and the company we're going to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 teach how to make a bestial recipe a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
 modification of a great classic that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.860
 recipe that we always make the day that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.689
 we want to create well with our partner 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.699
 we want to surprise her, let's go to the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.529
 fishmonger and our fishmonger tells us 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.000
 that I have a great golden to do 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.239
 wings to the problem for me is missing for 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.220
 see it lacks power and there is a part of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.199
 our world where is where 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.030
 they find some flavors that for our 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.879
 golden can be great citronella 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.019
 the delays a root that tastes like lemon a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.260
 bit hard we have the ginger we have 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.820
 lime leaves that fher we will do very 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.379
 simple we will take the ingredients more 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.379
 hard the citronella 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.660
 one day we will break into very fat pieces 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.800
 let's take the ginger not much quantity 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.369
 I am powerful we will put it in 34 the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.159
 pieces will open the only companion 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.250
 that we want is to chop it and introduce 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.979
 the first aromatic ingredients 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.830
 Asians that will give us a lot 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.770
 flavor we will go to the turbo and we will give 34 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.300
 blows until this medium chopped then 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.020
 we will apply to our ingredients a 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.020
 slightly softer 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.160
 here we have this first part when 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.110
 we have these harder ingredients 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.580
 cut what we will do is enter the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.010
 Trace of components a little more 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.170
 sides of the leek 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.170
 here we have an almost whole lining 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.110
 34 pieces of good joint could 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.600
 use a garlic happened in this case I'm going 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.600
 to use an agent a tender garlic 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.820
 I cilantro were three other such 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.920
 flavors that in the kitchen is there in the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.990
 oriental cuisine can not miss 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 Simplify a lot because our our 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.000
 will do the job 23 lemon zest 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.000
 we will add the lemon peel 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.909
 I encourage myself with a couple of whole watts 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.599
 we can only apply the same work 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.170
 that much at the beginning close our 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.170
 fellow portion 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.629
 others with the finished work 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.519
 all those super super components 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.190
 aromatic perfectly chopped and what 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.160
 I will use for two things to perform 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.610
 a fantastic farce that go inside 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.760
 the golden one I only have left 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.390
 something drier that is the salt we will take the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.940
 dried we will add mix the gold with the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.670
 salt big and what I'm going to do now 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.400
 is to introduce a little water very 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.030
 little that we mix everything and what 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.030
 we will have this 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.459
 to finish it I should add this pasta 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.409
 I have here this pasta is pasta 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.549
 miso rojo is a pasta made with its 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.549
 daughter and fermented 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.340
 and mix all the components here 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.500
 I have my farce about to fix the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.290
 golden that remains I have sex when fishing already 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.130
 so take my scale but which 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.090
 is to open up to the head 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.379
 open my fish 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.360
 and fill it with this farce so so 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.920
 so powerful and aromatic 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.470
 neither do you need to fill an excess 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.930
 Our only aim is to aromatize the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.810
 maybe with a Julian 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.810
 the typical lemon and wine julienne 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.000
 there are people who prowl the fish 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.340
 to better tell the temperature 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.330
 case of sea bream the salt does not make us 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.060
 no fault 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.870
 I already have the salt perfectly mixed 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.870
 a salt with all the aromas 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.190
 What I need for my fisherman is 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.540
 important that the salt has that tip of 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.180
 moisture to the bottom that will cause is 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.280
 that when cooking it will dry and it will be like 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.280
 a dome that will cover the fish 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.980
 what are we going to do very easy a good 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.980
 amount of salt 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.210
 we will cover all the background well in this 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.100
 source I think those who would have almost 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.400
 almost almost two golds of this size 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.220
 but good we put red 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.689
 we will place our fish 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.499
 and very cold 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.969
 Salt a lot of salt forming a dome 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:52.279
 We will close all parts of the fish 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.499
 we will look for a good perfect coat up 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:57.409
 here a lasted the classic salt with 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:05:00.240
 terrific great aromas and here at 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:03.860
 180 degree oven 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.729
 about 30 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.719
 30 35 between 25 to 35 minutes according to the 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.849
 power of our rice 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.389
 good good while cooking my adored 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.840
 and prepared these candied potatoes 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.389
 about 35 minutes 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.460
 I have this source to remove the salt 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.260
 truth is that it would be great 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.760
 bring this to the table and open it in front 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.410
 of our guests so as not to mess it up 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.360
 I like to remove the dome as you see 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:39.240
 the entire outer layer is removed 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.770
 that chicharron at a stroke when 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.039
 they separate well from the thorn is that this 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.020
 is that our market is juicy good 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.960
 and how it has to be 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.949
 we will remove the fish loin 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.250
 what we see on our potatoes 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.759
 smells good does not have the following 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.759
 coriander 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.950
 Sage flowers is easy easy with the 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.340
 help 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.370
 first of kitchen is not that the one of olé 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.370
 olé 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.309
 and 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.050
 and 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.050
 this 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.500
 with a minimum of dedication and help 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.410
