00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
these are going to be some tips to go

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.060 
these are going to be some tips to go
ahead<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.820> free<00:00:18.090> up<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.420> space<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.800> at

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
ahead and free up that space or to at

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.950 
ahead and free up that space or to at
least<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.460> some<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.789> back<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> start

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
least get some of it back so to start

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.109 
least get some of it back so to start
off<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.320> go<00:00:22.410> into<00:00:22.560> general<00:00:23.130> usage<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
off if you go into general usage and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
off if you go into general usage and
then<00:00:24.269> manage<00:00:24.689> storage<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.070> my

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
then manage storage you can see that my

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.519 
then manage storage you can see that my
photos<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.609> camera<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:26.970> taking<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.529> 336

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.040 
photos in camera are taking up 336
megabytes<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.330> just<00:00:30.330> keep<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.630> mind<00:00:30.750> I'll

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
megabytes so just keep that in mind I'll

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
megabytes so just keep that in mind I'll
go<00:00:31.170> ahead<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.439> show<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.890> after

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
go ahead and show you what it is after

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
go ahead and show you what it is after
we<00:00:32.520> change<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.090> stuff<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.140> first<00:00:34.380> tip

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
we change all this stuff the first tip

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
we change all this stuff the first tip
is<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.770> photos<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.250> camera<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.000> into

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
is in photos in camera if you go into

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.690 
is in photos in camera if you go into
photos<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.230> camera<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.590> settings<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.520> ahead

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
photos and camera and settings go ahead

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
photos and camera and settings go ahead
and<00:00:38.850> turn<00:00:39.000> off<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.510> photo<00:00:39.840> stream<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.800> photo

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and turn off my photo stream my photo

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.590 
and turn off my photo stream my photo
stream<00:00:41.160> essentially<00:00:41.760> makes<00:00:41.940> two<00:00:42.149> copies<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
stream essentially makes two copies of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
stream essentially makes two copies of
the<00:00:42.690> photo<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.920> device<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> then

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the photo one for your device and then

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
the photo one for your device and then
one<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.820> upload<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> photo<00:00:45.600> stream<00:00:45.960> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
one to upload to the photo stream so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.020 
one to upload to the photo stream so
you're<00:00:46.680> essentially<00:00:46.980> storing<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.640> copies<00:00:48.000> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you're essentially storing two copies of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.819 
you're essentially storing two copies of
each<00:00:48.149> photo<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.989> take<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.440> ton<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
each photo which can take up a ton of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
each photo which can take up a ton of
space<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.000> ahead<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> turn<00:00:51.390> off

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
space so you can go ahead and turn off

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
space so you can go ahead and turn off
photo<00:00:51.840> stream<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.710> will<00:00:52.860> delete<00:00:53.100> them

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
photo stream and it will delete them

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.279 
photo stream and it will delete them
from<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.640> device<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.600> next<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.079> you're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
from your device now next up you're
