00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.680 
plant them up and down the east coast
and<00:04:53.950> they're<00:04:54.950> great<00:04:55.250> for<00:04:55.280> windbreak<00:04:56.030> screens

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
and they're great for windbreak screens

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.740 
and they're great for windbreak screens
and<00:04:57.020> buffers<00:04:57.350> if<00:04:57.890> you<00:04:58.070> have<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> heavy

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
population of deer the tree will be

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.690 
population of deer the tree will be
damaged<00:05:02.150> slightly<00:05:02.840> yeah<00:05:03.770> what<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.520> might

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
damaged slightly yeah what you might

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.220 
damaged slightly yeah what you might
have<00:05:04.880> to<00:05:05.030> do<00:05:05.180> if<00:05:05.300> you<00:05:05.419> have<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.570> lot<00:05:05.750> of<00:05:05.780> deer<00:05:06.080> you

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
have to do if you have a lot of deer you

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.780 
have to do if you have a lot of deer you
might<00:05:06.410> have<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.710> spray<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.190> with<00:05:07.250> some<00:05:07.400> deer

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
might have to spray it with some deer

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.520 
might have to spray it with some deer
away<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.210> generally<00:05:08.810> speaking<00:05:09.050> if<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.380> have

away but generally speaking if you have

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.580 
away but generally speaking if you have
um<00:05:09.919> you<00:05:10.340> know<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.490> minor<00:05:11.270> deer<00:05:11.690> population<00:05:12.440> like

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
um you know a minor deer population like

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.140 
um you know a minor deer population like
a<00:05:12.620> deer<00:05:12.950> every<00:05:13.280> week<00:05:13.520> or<00:05:13.760> every<00:05:13.790> other<00:05:14.000> week

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
a deer every week or every other week

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.300 
a deer every week or every other week
walking<00:05:14.540> through<00:05:14.840> your<00:05:14.990> yard<00:05:15.169> this<00:05:15.710> tree<00:05:16.070> will

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
walking through your yard this tree will

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.550 
walking through your yard this tree will
not<00:05:16.340> be<00:05:16.520> bothered<00:05:17.090> if<00:05:17.270> you<00:05:17.750> have<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:17.960> minor<00:05:18.320> deer

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
not be bothered if you have a minor deer

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.880 
not be bothered if you have a minor deer
population<00:05:19.280> even<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:20.660> emerald<00:05:21.200> greens<00:05:21.500> can

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
population even the emerald greens can

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.570 
population even the emerald greens can
be<00:05:21.919> eaten<00:05:22.430> alive<00:05:23.169> so<00:05:24.169> we<00:05:24.800> recommend<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.430> green

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
be eaten alive so we recommend the green

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.550 
be eaten alive so we recommend the green
Giants<00:05:26.060> for<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> lot<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.870> windbreaks<00:05:27.350> and

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
Giants for a lot of windbreaks and

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.740 
Giants for a lot of windbreaks and
screens<00:05:27.919> and<00:05:28.160> buffers<00:05:28.520> for<00:05:29.210> their<00:05:29.419> deer

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
screens and buffers for their deer

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
screens and buffers for their deer
resistance<00:05:30.320> there

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
resistance there

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.129 
resistance there
resistance<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.759> another<00:05:32.330> good<00:05:32.750> feature<00:05:32.930> of

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
resistance and another good feature of

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.650 
resistance and another good feature of
this<00:05:33.379> tree<00:05:33.680> is<00:05:33.919> that<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.610> grows<00:05:34.759> predominantly

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
this tree is that it grows predominantly

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.020 
this tree is that it grows predominantly
with<00:05:35.840> one<00:05:36.229> single<00:05:36.889> leader<00:05:37.160> as<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.550> see<00:05:37.759> here

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
with one single leader as you see here

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.839 
with one single leader as you see here
now<00:05:38.720> this<00:05:38.930> leader<00:05:39.229> can<00:05:39.740> almost<00:05:40.039> be<00:05:40.340> bent<00:05:40.610> back

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
now this leader can almost be bent back

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:41.770 
now this leader can almost be bent back
to<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.180> ground

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
to the ground

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.800 
to the ground
it's<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.169> very<00:05:42.530> tough<00:05:42.860> plant<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:44.000> you<00:05:44.569> know<00:05:44.690> it

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
it's a very tough plant and you know it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.760 
it's a very tough plant and you know it
takes<00:05:45.379> a<00:05:45.560> lot<00:05:45.740> of<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:46.159> lot<00:05:46.580> of<00:05:46.639> abuse<00:05:47.090> and<00:05:47.659> it<00:05:48.650> can

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
takes a lot of a lot of abuse and it can

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.839 
takes a lot of a lot of abuse and it can
withstand<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.310> lot<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.610> wind<00:05:49.849> and<00:05:50.030> snow<00:05:50.240> damage

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
withstand a lot of wind and snow damage

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.719 
withstand a lot of wind and snow damage
it's<00:05:52.849> forgiving<00:05:53.509> on<00:05:53.629> the<00:05:53.780> soil<00:05:54.050> types<00:05:54.379> and<00:05:54.729> it

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
it's forgiving on the soil types and it

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.640 
it's forgiving on the soil types and it
can<00:05:55.879> take<00:05:56.090> a<00:05:56.120> little<00:05:56.419> bit<00:05:56.659> of<00:05:56.780> shade<00:05:57.050> the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
can take a little bit of shade the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.260 
can take a little bit of shade the
reason<00:05:57.979> it<00:05:58.069> can<00:05:58.190> take<00:05:58.370> some<00:05:58.550> shade<00:05:58.759> is<00:05:58.909> you<00:05:59.030> can

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
reason it can take some shade is you can

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.719 
reason it can take some shade is you can
see<00:05:59.419> it's<00:05:59.569> a<00:05:59.629> little<00:05:59.720> bit<00:05:59.930> open<00:06:00.169> a<00:06:00.500> very<00:06:01.280> close

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
see it's a little bit open a very close

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.879 
see it's a little bit open a very close
dense<00:06:02.270> tree<00:06:02.720> like<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.050> emerald<00:06:03.380> green<00:06:03.409> can

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
dense tree like the emerald green can

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.950 
dense tree like the emerald green can
take<00:06:04.130> no<00:06:04.430> shade<00:06:04.789> but<00:06:04.819> the<00:06:05.300> Green<00:06:05.479> Giant<00:06:05.509> is

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
take no shade but the Green Giant is

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.960 
take no shade but the Green Giant is
more<00:06:06.169> open<00:06:06.590> so<00:06:06.770> it<00:06:06.889> can<00:06:07.039> live<00:06:07.220> in<00:06:07.340> a<00:06:07.400> in<00:06:07.610> a
