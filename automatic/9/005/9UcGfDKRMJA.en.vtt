00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
really this might be a massive lie but

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.430 
really this might be a massive lie but
at<00:00:14.940> least<00:00:15.089> you're<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.480> first<00:00:15.750> person<00:00:15.929> shooter

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
right okay so this is obviously set in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.960

World<00:00:24.480> War<00:00:24.600> two<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.250> you're<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.490> Irish

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.360 
a whole lot of mess with the resistance
and<00:00:32.460> basically<00:00:33.360> they<00:00:33.840> choose<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:35.160> fight

for them and your character is a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
loudmouth hard-hitting womanizer which

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880 
loudmouth hard-hitting womanizer which
makes<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.280> story<00:00:41.760> better<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
makes the story better but you know it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
makes the story better but you know it
really<00:00:44.100> wasn't<00:00:44.550> enough<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.120> me<00:00:45.390> care<00:00:45.719> for

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
really wasn't enough to make me care for

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
really wasn't enough to make me care for
the<00:00:45.960> characters<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:47.340> wasn't

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the characters at all there wasn't

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.959 
the characters at all there wasn't
enough<00:00:48.000> depth<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.320> story<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
enough depth in the story and really I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
enough depth in the story and really I
just<00:00:51.120> forgot<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.020> very<00:00:52.289> short<00:00:52.649> story

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
just forgot about the very short story

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060 
just forgot about the very short story
that<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.699> included<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that is included and this is from the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.279 
that is included and this is from the
recently<00:00:56.489> shot<00:00:56.789> down<00:00:56.969> pandemic<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> also

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
recently shot down pandemic and also

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.900 
recently shot down pandemic and also
hoping<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> bang<00:00:59.430> since

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hoping they go out with a bang since

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
hoping they go out with a bang since
they<00:01:00.090> haven't<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.570> many<00:01:00.930> successful

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
they haven't had that many successful

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.189 
they haven't had that many successful
games<00:01:01.829> games<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> past<00:01:03.199> unfortunately

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
games games in the past unfortunately

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.980 
games games in the past unfortunately
saboteurs<00:01:04.979> story<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.729> doesn't<00:01:05.880> cut<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:08.990> ok

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
saboteurs story just doesn't cut it ok

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
saboteurs story just doesn't cut it ok
so<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> graphics<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
so the graphics are probably one of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
so the graphics are probably one of the
most<00:01:11.369> significant<00:01:12.060> part<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> saboteur

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
most significant part of the saboteur

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
most significant part of the saboteur
that<00:01:13.710> being<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> place<00:01:14.460> where<00:01:14.490> Nazis

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that being in the place where Nazis

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.719 
that being in the place where Nazis
occupied<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.350> gray<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:17.189> dull<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
occupied it's all gray and very dull and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
occupied it's all gray and very dull and
this<00:01:18.240> looks<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.869> very<00:01:18.990> cool<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
this looks very very cool and this is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.999 
this looks very very cool and this is
probably<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> best<00:01:20.909> part<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.600> game

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
probably the best part about the game

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.260 
probably the best part about the game
unfortunately<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> gain<00:01:23.820> part<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
unfortunately when you gain part of the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
unfortunately when you gain part of the
city<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.750> turns<00:01:25.320> Carl<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> looks<00:01:26.310> very

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
city it turns Carl and this looks very

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.020 
city it turns Carl and this looks very
very<00:01:26.970> bad<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.920> unpolished<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
very bad and very unpolished so that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.359 
very bad and very unpolished so that
kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> sucks<00:01:30.829> some<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> good<00:01:32.159> things

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
kind of sucks some of the good things

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.310 
kind of sucks some of the good things
about<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> explosions<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.110> look

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
about this is the explosions they look

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.190 
about this is the explosions they look
pretty<00:01:34.350> cool<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> climbing<00:01:36.390> looks<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:37.049> very

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
pretty cool the climbing looks very very

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
pretty cool the climbing looks very very
sketchy<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.610> climb<00:01:38.790> up

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
sketchy you know you can climb up

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
sketchy you know you can climb up
anything<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.840> look<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> retard<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
anything it look like a retard doing it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
anything it look like a retard doing it
so<00:01:42.030> overall<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> graphics<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.140> very

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
so overall the graphics are very

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
so overall the graphics are very
unpolished<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.939> they're<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.689> gray

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
unpolished when they're not in the gray

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.889 
unpolished when they're not in the gray
areas<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.399> looks<00:01:47.520> very<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:48.000> bad

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
areas and it just looks very very bad

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.530 
areas and it just looks very very bad
and<00:01:49.200> sloppy<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.399> know<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> movements

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and sloppy you know all the movements

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.370 
and sloppy you know all the movements
look<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.560> very<00:01:52.710> stiff<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> again<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.350> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
look very very stiff so again it just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
look very very stiff so again it just
doesn't<00:01:55.950> cut<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> subsoil<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> do

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
doesn't cut it so in the subsoil you do

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
doesn't cut it so in the subsoil you do
some<00:01:58.350> food<00:01:58.590> meters<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.250> running<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.729> sit<00:01:59.939> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
some food meters and running you sit and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.170 
some food meters and running you sit and
climb<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> use<00:02:01.020> some<00:02:01.229> driving<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.149> none<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
climb and use some driving and none of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.639 
climb and use some driving and none of
these<00:02:03.420> things<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.810> very<00:02:03.840> polished<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.530> all

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
these things are very polished at all

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.139 
these things are very polished at all
the<00:02:05.009> climbing<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> climb<00:02:06.119> on

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
part of the game that I disliked very

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.570 
part of the game that I disliked very
much<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.860> you're<00:02:40.860> working<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.459> the

person<00:02:46.290> there's<00:02:46.650> no<00:02:46.769> con<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.280> don't<00:02:47.519> know<00:02:47.580> if

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
person there's no con I don't know if

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
person there's no con I don't know if
that<00:02:47.849> just<00:02:48.060> went<00:02:48.239> over<00:02:48.360> their<00:02:48.540> heads<00:02:48.780> or<00:02:49.080> what

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
that just went over their heads or what

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 
that just went over their heads or what
but<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.099> know<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.489> just<00:02:50.519> doesn't<00:02:50.760> seem<00:02:51.120> right

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
but you know it just doesn't seem right

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.020 
but you know it just doesn't seem right
to<00:02:51.420> me<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.500> overall<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.160> gameplay<00:02:53.549> isn't<00:02:53.760> very

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to me so overall the gameplay isn't very

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.309 
to me so overall the gameplay isn't very
good<00:02:54.120> i<00:02:54.180> didn't<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:54.810> much<00:02:54.989> at<00:02:55.230> all

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
good i didn't like it very much at all

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.920 
good i didn't like it very much at all
the<00:02:55.890> explosions<00:02:56.220> are<00:02:56.519> good<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.329> has<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> lot

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the explosions are good but it has a lot

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.770 
the explosions are good but it has a lot
of<00:02:58.380> problems<00:02:59.040> alright<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.209> what<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> think<00:03:00.569> in

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
of problems alright so what I think in

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.809 
of problems alright so what I think in
