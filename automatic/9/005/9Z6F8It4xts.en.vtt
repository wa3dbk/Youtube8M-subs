00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.779
 torrent that we go to our browser 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.779

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.870
 and it takes us here 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.809

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 Download folder 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.860
 and here I have it, we would give it two clicks 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.840
 and we would give him ok, let's go for this, 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.940
 have first downloaded the torrent os 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.559
 I will leave also for there is a good link 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.290
 now it's downloading sky link so 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.079
 Well, if there was a good gameplay but 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.610
 not yet 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.800
 to remove 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.800
 also good the patch we take copy 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.229
 let's see 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.909
 and this is the patch the new version 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.730
 I already have all these 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.740
 downloaded 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.710
 but now I will say how they are installed 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.710
 good and the multiplayer patch 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.240
 but to look for cargo there is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 well first it would be installed 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.840
 this football 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.610
 version 1.4 point 382 and then the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.729
 techno modern warfare 3 that is for 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.040
 play online well I've done this for 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.369
 play would be like that and now we're 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.170
 downloaded as I told you and here 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.140
 you have the stock that is in the folder 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.899
 resulting from the good torrent mine is 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.050
 updated with the versions but I'm going to 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.310
 say how they install good would catch 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.860
 first this one 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.510
 the 1.4 point 382 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 catch everything 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.450
 you open 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.780
 and you stay inside 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.430
 and with the other look 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.989
 but you take 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.350
 this is the most important 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.370
 good this you catch 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.020
 return that folder you take and everything for 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:50.510
 deliver cojÃ¡is here and that's it and I've 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.510
 done this you will leave this icon 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.630
 that can throw a few small errors the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.360
 notice because I shot one shot me 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.280
 this 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:07.450
 the net framework framework 4 you have to 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.180

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.140

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.140

 good idea I'll put frax 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.980

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.070
 Japan flaps and verified 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.350
 good guys, well, we would have 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.410
 this 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.960
 we would stay if he appears to us he was in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.040
 this little window of servers we would give 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.110
 play in game for example here 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.960
 and we give it back like this 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.840
 and he would not go out to serve 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:12.970
 you think I have already at level 80 is not the 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.120
 sixth prestige fifth good total let's go 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.389
 to be bears 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.009
 and we give internet we go a couple of times 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:25.439
 here to refresh passed many 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.630
 and then for example to see good we can 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.370
 to put 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.370
 now I have a favorite is some 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.610
 added for the big favorite only 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.720
 is to apply this for example and here act 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.440
 favorites 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.440
 good 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.040
 how to get into this for example is it 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.900
 let 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.020
 to those who will not let me get in I do not know why 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.020
 what 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.600
 and this one is going 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.310
 I do everything just for you to see that 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.310
 yes they work and you are saying 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.310
 works 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.950
 so yes it works if it has a 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.550
 error there I will leave the solutions to me 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.040
 put the first one so the insurance is not 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.510
 to remove but if you remove that install 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:23.520
 these guys is simple simple very simple 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.520
 so I hope you all know how to do it 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.870
 we are here 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.330
 to lower the volume because it is 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.840
 we would not be here 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.840

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.410
 all very high sensitivity

 As you can see, it works with the 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:01.729
 call I'm recording at 30 fps it's because 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:05.199
