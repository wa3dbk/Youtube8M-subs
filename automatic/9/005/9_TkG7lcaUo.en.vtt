00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello a greeting people watching my videos 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.280
 today I come with a video something fast in what 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 which refers to my opinion about the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.299
 quintana Latin dubbing that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.070
 It premiered recently by netflix 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.080
 first of all I will say that I am not a mega 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 knowing about all this medium that is 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
 the dubbing which I like and in 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.560
 certain point I like to investigate how it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.599
 does the whole process and one more will exceed 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 but well what are we going for me 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.830
 Jim's Latin dubbing is more than 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.830
 vi of its 24 chapters is a dubbing 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.230
 decent neither very good nor very bad so what 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 I put for me the cast of voices is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.239
 more or less let's start with fifth that 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 first of all I think it's almost 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 impossible to match that style that puts you 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 as a case his hit a in japan to fifth that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 it is a very high stick to reach even 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 in the dubbing of Spain was not achieved either 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.070
 as for jesus' well-known barrero 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.079
 by the voice of sevilla de pegaso which 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 is a big one of this industry and everything 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.429
 that with a great trajectory and so on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 etcetera but still the voice does not hit 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.570
 so much with the character especially in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.640
 the first chapters since it seemed 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.619
 for some who were listening to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.340
 sevilla although for me it looks more like 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.880
 the cloud 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.890
 and also that he lacks that tone 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.229
 sarcastic and mocking that has gene toki 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.810
 as well as some stupid expressions 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.789
 of the character x of which is something of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 that is lacking in this version or its 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.929
 interpretation is not all bad anymore 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 that as per the chapters of the 15th for 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.600
 above 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 Jesus Barrero is already starting to grab a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.009
 little more to the personality of gene toki 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.959
 and dock better with this one which is not 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.329
 bad at all his voice but personally 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.369
 I would have preferred a voice something like 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.259
 the voice of johnny bravo or something like that 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.329
 which I think would have been a bit 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369
 better that tone of voice but well that of 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.619
 figure is one of the ones that I liked most 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.140
 which although not that Chinese tone the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.420
 voice hits well and even in acting it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 I did something similar to the original the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.679
 of sympathy for more or less since a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.689
 Sometimes I feel the actor sometimes overreacts 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.879
 too much to the character but I do not 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.860
 ends up convincing the whole but good 

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:04.590
 so as not to make it long with all 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.599
 characters the voices that I liked the most 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.819
 apart from the goat were those of 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.039
 takatsuka which does not have that voice so 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.959
 serious as the Japanese but has that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.430
 evil tone so for me there remains the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.769
 voice of greeting saw the voice of others 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.200
 who was the one who gave the voice to his 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.060
 of smoke which is its best the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.489
 demand or that of another and perhaps that of 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.069
 yamazaki those from south to bottom and sakamoto 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.109
 They are regular and good as all 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.420
 know what we have seen the dubbing 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.939
 that the worst voice of all was that of 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.519
 you take off or fuck hugo they put a voice 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.409
 as a child and even at the beginning I thought 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.939
 that was Naruto's voice was made to me 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.340
 similar medium since the show that 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.379
 we know that kind of 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.450
 voice since this is a sadistic fucking 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.970
 homicidal I think that that will be the stone in 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.970
 the shoe of this dubbing if they do not listen 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.420
 explosion you let the terrorists 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.400
 they will attack another of them because you did not do 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.890
 nothing and if you have to do your house 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.380
 work 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.090
 draw your own conclusions but 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.890
 good in a few words for me the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.990
 cast is between the average good and 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.180
 decent since some is fine its 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.640
 acting of the character but sometimes the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.620
 voice did not hit so much with these the only 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.990
 voice that I could not hear was that of otsu 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.970
 since I did not find that fucking chapter 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.100
 fuck but one of the things that I 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.070
 worried when they announced their dubbing 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.200
 was the translation and adaptation you know 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.360
 to keep the jokes and references 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.850
 Japanese and in the end he exceeded my 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.950
 expectations remained and was preserved 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.110
 all that where maybe if you 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.690
 they softened a little some rudeness a 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.489
 little rises but the same happens already 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.860
 the context of what is lost 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.200
 it is being talked like that so that it also 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.420
 coup a Latino audience without need 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.190
 of resorting much to censorship which 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.280
 It was a good translation job 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.320
 I would even give it an 85 out of 10 which 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.810
 had his mistakes in pronunciation of 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.150
 several honorary names as well as 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.580
 other things although that did have an error 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.310
 something bad with the character of much the 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.209
 partner of the sakamoto asshole where 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.209
 listen to you 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.800
 we have a problematic boss a gift 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.800
 from our boss capture 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.039
 and the fact that this will be the last time 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.050
 that does it our ships are of use 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.850
 commercial we can not be getting 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.759
 in trouble not even by our 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.620
 leader and matba if they seem to be 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.990
 forgot that a lot is a woman and a 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.210
 chapter to another they changed sex on 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.550
 which is an error but it is an error that 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.889
 can still be corrected to clear future if 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.750
 they keep folding more chapters another 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.210
 which I liked that they did not put those 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.460
 Mexican idioms which for some 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.770
 reason I do not like them nowadays since the 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.479
 dubbing is not only Mexican but for 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.220
 all latin america 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.349
 another thing that had commented another 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.479
 user in a video about the dubbing of 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.699
 quintana is that it seemed that the voices 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.039
 they repeated talking about the characters 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.440
 secondary which I also had that 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.419
 but I do not know if it's my idea or 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.090
 something like that so I can not be 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.949
 sure which if it were true maybe it's 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.199
 because there is not as much staff as in the 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.030
 federal district since we remember that 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.070
 the dubbing of quintana doubled in 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.050
 cuernavaca morelos and not in the district 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.030
 federal which is where they are almost 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.620
 all the dubbing studies and 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.900
 remembering that the distance of 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.449
 cuernavaca the federal district is 1 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.520
 or retired not so much to exaggerate but 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.290
 if you take some time off which also 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.570
 you can see that there are not so many voices 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.940
 known apart from jesus barrero 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.680
 and in part it's a good thing since many 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.960
 Studies and directors of the district 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.509
 federal like to put a lot of idiom 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.789
 not all mexican but if there are some 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.889
 but good to finish this video 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.350
 I'll just say that the dubbing of jindama is 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.419
 decent which made me laugh not so much 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.490
 like the original but it still caused me 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.530
 clear grace from my very sick and 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.360
 twisted sense of humor in what 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.639
 staff I would like to be followed 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.080
 doubling more chapters of quintana to 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.080
 see how far this can go 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.910
 dubbing since 24 chapters are for me 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.300
 very little to be able to draw a conclusion 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.490
 as exact as well as see the serious sagas 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.770
 of jinta ma if you have not seen the dubbing 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.870
 they have to pay for netflix or make it 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.180
 like me who expected someone to climb 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.760
 the chapters to some page and be 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.830
 seeing them well xd but good one that is 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.199
 poor person has to make use of whatever is 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.599
 at your reach but well with this I finish 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.460
 remember that it is only my opinion some 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.830
 You can say it's good for others 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.080
 bad for others maybe regular 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.120
 it's okay I've heard different points 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.010
 of view on this dubbing both good 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.200
 as bad so all are valid 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.180
 minus the assholes that do not 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.480
 they saw and they say it's shit without before 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.310
 have seen it etc. etcetera et cetera 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.560
 comment what you think I'm going going 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.580
 the independent shrink says goodbye 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.580
 until next time
