 Cosmetic bags present with 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.470
 materials from the home 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.759
 the special thing about these substances is that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.430
 they are coated 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.940
 and in very great different 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.260
 sites 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.770
 we also need tile rest hair 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.850
 630 very important that the inside pages 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.040
 to be passed we need 30 each 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.040
 cm fabric from both the coated 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.520
 as well as from the lining this material 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.570
 we cut into two equal parts 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:03.939
 24 to 22 cm the coated fabrics 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.790
 and also the feed 24 to 22 cm 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:09.049
 and an inner pocket with dimensions 24 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.630
 on 17 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.759
 I have always prepared you the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.430
 we fold in half and inside 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.560
 call those around with a narrow one 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.560
 set straight stitch 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 miss and cut off the corners 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.610
 then the whole thing is turned over and we 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.750
 call that on one of the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.740
 coated inside pockets and catch 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.820
 then almost 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 here at the corner around including the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.860
 fix all turn opening 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.619
 the break in the middle remains open and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.380
 I call that sitting here nicely 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:08.530
 Thus, the walls opening at 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.530
 landline automatically closed 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.280
 and then we have the bag here 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.530
 made in valdez zippers 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 you should pay attention that he is 3 cm 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.540
 is longer than the format of the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.970
 Cosmetic bag and he should too 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.460
 Of course, they fit on the color 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.030
 inner lining with the already sewn on 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.170
 pocket, I now put the zipper 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.350
 with the slider on the left of the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 then quilt the whole b feet wide then 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.240
 From now on, it's like that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.640
 bags lining part with the inside pocket 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.550
 sewn the other padded lining part 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.830
 just as to the bag take the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.260
 I would like to open the zipper 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.660
 I pinned this and sewed it 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.140
 best when the zipper is open 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.140
 firmly 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.330
 We now have both feed parts 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.290
 Now catch the zipper mowed 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.450
 we materials with the laminated the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.170
 outside bags we call against 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.560
 right at the zipper and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.560
 if possible, tap into the same edges 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.860
 as previously shared with danish 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.010
 if we open it then it looks like that 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.010
 out 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.360
 again at the beginning and at the end 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.770
 locked and I sew best with 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.770
 open zipper 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.930
 if i put the zipper back again 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.080
 Close you can see that the best 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.480
 inner parts are finished and the outside 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.070
 part is against equal to the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.290
 zipper mowed 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:09.410
 if you compare that with me now 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.500
 another model that you both 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.660
 bags of lining parts you have here is 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.660
 It was designed in june and the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.060
 Outside pockets are against the same 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.400
 sewn zipper so I'm doing now 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.890
 times with this model on and that 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.680
 Now let's put the coated ones 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.570
 both coated exterior parts 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.169
 on each other and we take care that 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.250
 the edges really are together 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.090
 meet on 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.940
 We divide food at the bags 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.400
 at the bottom of a piece of free that is 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.480
 important because we pocket it later 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.520
 still have to turn 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.460
 I prefer the zipper 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:59.700
 little else then not afterwards 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.280
 out of sheer enthusiasm over it 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.260
 sewing it is important that the 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.260
 really put edges precisely to one another 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:16.360
 As I said on the bottom of the bag I leave 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:20.440
 about a 10 to 12 inches tall and 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.830
 Sewn area to thank the cosmetics 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.040
 to be able to turn the bag better 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.280
 I now have everything through to a piece 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.600
 sewn to the open position on the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.620
 bags lining ground 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.960
 I now cut even all corners before 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:44.950
 We still have to floor the walls 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:48.700
 I create for the ground corners 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:52.050
 the bottom and sides stitched together 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:56.860
 and sew it in the right angle 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.910
 mark and with a straight stitch in the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.210
 right angle 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:06.130
 vote I own here 3 cm in 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.790
 Right angle you can tune it 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.280
 Stake up to 5 cm and across 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.150
 Sewing , of course, then becomes wider 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.170
 the bottom of the cosmetics of the Czech Republic 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.730
 cut off generously 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:26.410
 the seams and then the same 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:30.000
 make fodder with the bags and 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.830
 now only when all four corners 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.100
 I can do that 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.800
 bind tÃ¤schchen 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.330
 here again with the edges and corners 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.600
 Forma a bit the corners 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.100
 work out 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.640
 Now you can clearly see the bags 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.390
 ground 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:51.680
 then i can still spread the ground apart 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.680
 get stuck and take 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:02.819
 and last but not least the feed 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:05.949
 turn inside and that's it 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.979
 Cosmetic bag the instructions 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:11.529
 they all enjoy the internet a lot 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:15.120
 when reworking and until the next 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.120
 times at wahlzeit.tv
