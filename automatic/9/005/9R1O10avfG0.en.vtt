and if you leave it there too long it
will<00:02:23.940> start<00:02:24.180> losing<00:02:24.300> some<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> flavor<00:02:25.020> but

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
will start losing some of the flavor but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.900 
will start losing some of the flavor but

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
coming through the barrel charred being

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.830 
coming through the barrel charred being
very<00:07:16.710> very<00:07:16.950> nice<00:07:17.220> touch<00:07:17.970> on<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:18.360> back<00:07:18.540> end

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.480 
it's a little more again complexity to

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.030 
it's a little more again complexity to
the<00:07:21.600> whiskey<00:07:26.360> man<00:07:27.360> I<00:07:27.720> can't<00:07:28.380> believe<00:07:28.560> when<00:07:29.010> you

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.390 
taste this you won't believe that you
just<00:07:30.360> paid<00:07:30.720> thirty<00:07:31.440> five<00:07:31.680> forty<00:07:31.950> five<00:07:31.980> dollars

for<00:07:32.520> a<00:07:32.580> whiskey<00:07:33.020> it<00:07:34.020> definitely<00:07:34.470> feels<00:07:34.850> bigger

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
for a whiskey it definitely feels bigger

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.080 
for a whiskey it definitely feels bigger
than<00:07:36.120> that<00:07:36.980> worth<00:07:37.980> every<00:07:38.640> penny<00:07:38.670> in<00:07:39.000> my

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
than that worth every penny in my

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.000 
than that worth every penny in my
opinion<00:07:39.510> for<00:07:39.690> that<00:07:39.810> feeling<00:07:40.140> small<00:07:40.830> batch

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.010 
opinion for that feeling small batch

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.320 
opinion for that feeling small batch
Irish<00:07:41.400> whiskey<00:07:43.610> doesn't<00:07:44.610> feel<00:07:44.730> over<00:07:45.000> drying

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.330 
Irish whiskey doesn't feel over drying

it's<00:07:45.570> not<00:07:45.750> drying<00:07:45.990> out<00:07:46.170> on<00:07:46.290> the<00:07:46.410> finish<00:07:46.710> it

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830 
it's not drying out on the finish it

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.530 
it's not drying out on the finish it
just<00:07:46.860> remains<00:07:47.250> flavorful<00:07:47.790> the<00:07:48.180> fruits

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.540 
just remains flavorful the fruits

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.230 
just remains flavorful the fruits
actually<00:07:48.750> rolled<00:07:49.170> back<00:07:49.410> in<00:07:49.680> on<00:07:49.860> the<00:07:49.980> finish<00:07:50.240> so

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 
actually rolled back in on the finish so

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.640 
actually rolled back in on the finish so
they<00:07:51.330> don't<00:07:51.510> just<00:07:51.660> pop<00:07:51.900> in<00:07:52.080> the<00:07:52.170> front<00:07:52.440> then

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.650 
they don't just pop in the front then

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.750 
they don't just pop in the front then
everything<00:07:53.040> fades<00:07:53.310> out<00:07:53.490> they<00:07:53.640> actually

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:53.760 
everything fades out they actually

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.430

00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.610 
yep they just keep rolling through the

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.490 
yep they just keep rolling through the
finish<00:07:59.790> no<00:08:00.030> discernible<00:08:00.570> alcohol<00:08:01.050> on<00:08:01.320> the

palate or the nose of this whiskey I

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.450 
palate or the nose of this whiskey I
think<00:08:03.720> it's<00:08:03.810> very<00:08:03.930> well<00:08:04.170> made<00:08:04.230> so<00:08:05.070> again<00:08:05.310> if

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 
think it's very well made so again if

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.860 
think it's very well made so again if
you<00:08:05.550> can<00:08:05.580> find<00:08:05.910> this<00:08:06.030> one<00:08:06.150> which<00:08:06.330> you<00:08:06.540> should

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:06.870 
you can find this one which you should

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.930
