the same
and<00:01:22.189> this<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:23.360> when<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.630> start<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:23.960> game<00:01:24.079> on

I think that that won't start to
progress<00:01:31.189> that's<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.789> best<00:01:32.000> one<00:01:32.149> it's<00:01:32.869> not

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
progress that's the best one it's not

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.660 
progress that's the best one it's not
progress<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.560> start<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.070> start<00:01:34.399> to

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
progress to start is to start to
