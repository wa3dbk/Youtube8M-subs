redstone torch correctly they will so
right<00:02:05.299> under<00:02:05.540> where<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:05.990> redstone<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.650> is

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
right under where the redstone is is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.859 
right under where the redstone is is
there<00:02:07.610> at<00:02:07.729> some<00:02:07.909> torches<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.450> you'll<00:02:08.690> see

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
should be ready to start placing down

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.900 
should be ready to start placing down
your<00:02:48.360> redstone<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:50.070> on<00:02:50.160> both<00:02:50.340> sides<00:02:50.610> just

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
your redstone so on both sides just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:59.780 
your redstone so on both sides just
start<00:02:51.390> placing<00:02:51.600> any<00:02:51.780> redstone<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:58.790> sorry

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
start placing any redstone like so sorry

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.030 
start placing any redstone like so sorry
and<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.510> put<00:03:00.750> block<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.530> gonna<00:03:01.770> put<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and you can put block I'm gonna put the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.790 
and you can put block I'm gonna put the
blocks<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.580> here<00:03:02.610> because<00:03:03.600> uh<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.320> my<00:03:04.500> pressure

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
blocks up here because uh so my pressure

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.350 
blocks up here because uh so my pressure
plates<00:03:05.130> will<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.430> able<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.850> detect<00:03:06.150> them

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
plates will be able to detect them

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.720 
plates will be able to detect them
because<00:03:06.570> they<00:03:06.690> were<00:03:06.750> too<00:03:06.930> far<00:03:07.140> under<00:03:07.490> so<00:03:08.490> just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
because they were too far under so just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.620 
because they were too far under so just
connect<00:03:09.060> all<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.420> redstone<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:10.830> need<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.070> go

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
connect all the redstone they need to go

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.990 
connect all the redstone they need to go
make<00:03:12.630> sure<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.900> connect<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.350> or<00:03:13.680> else<00:03:14.000> they

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
make sure you connect that or else they

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500 
make sure you connect that or else they
will<00:03:15.120> not<00:03:15.180> open<00:03:15.480> forever<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.240> have<00:03:18.360> all

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
will not open forever so you have all

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.240 
will not open forever so you have all
the<00:03:18.660> redstone<00:03:19.020> connected<00:03:19.530> they<00:03:19.890> all<00:03:20.010> look<00:03:20.190> up

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the redstone connected they all look up

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.460 
the redstone connected they all look up
