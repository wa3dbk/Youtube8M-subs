engine<00:01:22.960> has<00:01:23.140> not<00:01:23.410> one<00:01:23.740> but<00:01:23.770> two<00:01:24.310> turbochargers

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
engine has not one but two turbochargers

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.200

as<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.840> result<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.590> produces<00:01:27.160> 300<00:01:27.910> horsepower

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
as a result it produces 300 horsepower

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.889 
as a result it produces 300 horsepower
but<00:01:28.960> more<00:01:29.140> importantly<00:01:30.300> 300<00:01:31.300> pound<00:01:31.570> feet<00:01:31.840> of

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
but more importantly 300 pound feet of

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.010 
but more importantly 300 pound feet of
torque<00:01:32.050> at<00:01:32.350> just<00:01:32.530> 14<00:01:33.009> hundred<00:01:33.250> rpm

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
torque at just 14 hundred rpm

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.230 
torque at just 14 hundred rpm
consequently<00:01:35.130> absolutely<00:01:36.130> no<00:01:36.399> turbo<00:01:36.970> lag

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
consequently absolutely no turbo lag

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.480 
consequently absolutely no turbo lag
which<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.660> very<00:01:37.899> rare<00:01:38.020> but<00:01:38.710> more<00:01:38.860> importantly

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
which is very rare but more importantly
