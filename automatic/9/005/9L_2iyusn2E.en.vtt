00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 hey you there are you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.520
 ever thought of taking a leaked line 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.510
 before you think of the treadmill know that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.850
 this issue we want to address the somewhat 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.710
 important for life 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.140
 how many times have we not heard the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.120
 following report truck loses brake on 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.300
 descent of the mountain and occasion of the accident 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.340
 very serious or even truck 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.550
 renegades descended at high speed and 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.489
 I fell forbidding the highway well being 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.530
 responsible professional trucker and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:02.340
 not the panels is ninja gonna see what was going on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 tutu is from rotai mil gralla is equal to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.790
 take over every day 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.060
 the risk of killing yourself and killing other 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.619
 people a vehicle of this size for more 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.930
 again it is for the best 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.090
 technologies that are still invested 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.190
 suffer from a chronic problem 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.119
 loss of brake efficiency when 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.890
 heated 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.290
 the descent of the mountain is a 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.410
 extreme stress for all systems 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.860
 of both suspension braking truck 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.080
 engine everything is where it unfortunately places itself 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.180
 this proves and sometimes to a surprise 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.250
 in the middle of the road with the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.409
 avoiding accidents to preserve lives and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.909
 inhibit moral and material damage 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.890
 the engineers design a system 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.010
 fairly effective for this type of 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.290
 situation to the famous escape areas 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.650
 There you ask me how it works. 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.280
 well it is simple in a strategic point of 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.049
 saw 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.640
 generally where they are more inclined and the 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.760
 Vehicle has to pick up speed 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.510
 is located a continuous band in 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.220
 straight line 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.200
 used for total braking of the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.780
 vehicle it has a kind of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.340
 hydrated clay and gravel which 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.769
 to generate friction with truck wheels 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.610
 are able to do so in question 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.100
 seconds 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.890
 the effectiveness of this system is so great 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.230
 that with a layer of only 20 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.330
 centimeters of material is possible to stop 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250
 an articulator with a total gross weight of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.140
 more than 45 tonnes 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.090
 in just over 100 meters in just 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.370
 five seconds 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.720
 with this system being implemented in the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.480
 of greater traffic of vehicles 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.940
 heavy road safety is 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.400
 evident and the risk of death decrease 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.600
 mechanical failures happen clearly with 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.370
 frequency 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.430
 but the main factor for these 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.080
 areas occur is the lack of care for the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 overconfidence 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.810
 That famous one I know I have one 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.840
 a little too much confidence in my 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.680
 if you and me by the da da in the box 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.420
 or can be reduced to more than 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.780
 of paraíba supports I think there is one more 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:07.570
 freak that works is good to win that is the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.520
 ceac olice the best thing to do is actually 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.320
 guide the acquaintances 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.330
 friends and all those who carry this 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.250
 brasilzão on the back 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
 caution even better way to avoid 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.400
 accidents 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.260
 It was a little longer video. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.390
 explanatory because we know that 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.370
 especially at the beginning of the year the number 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.410
 of accidents is very large 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.930
 did you understand I would like to 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.030
 inform someone else applied on jewelry 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.520
 Copy the link above and send it to everyone. 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.140
 your friends the age to sign up 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.570
 here in the step every week for step 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.060
 of the videos we return to the 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.060
 next week and see you later
