ok this is the palsy from hobbytron calm
and<00:00:13.870> basically<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.889> problem<00:00:15.250> with<00:00:15.340> the<00:00:15.430> palm

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
Z is when it goes right it spins too

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.420 
Z is when it goes right it spins too
sharp<00:00:18.880> so<00:00:19.750> what<00:00:19.930> we<00:00:20.080> want<00:00:20.259> to<00:00:20.320> do<00:00:20.529> is<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:21.400> want

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.499 
to stop from spinning so sharp and we
want<00:00:24.430> to<00:00:24.490> give<00:00:24.610> a<00:00:24.640> little<00:00:24.759> bit<00:00:24.910> more<00:00:25.029> power<00:00:25.270> to

that<00:02:10.899> off<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.410> bit<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:13.660> hard<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:14.050> it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
that off a little bit it's hard to do it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.840 
that off a little bit it's hard to do it
in<00:02:14.230> your<00:02:14.350> hands<00:02:14.800> normally<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.820> a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
in your hands normally do this on a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.840 
in your hands normally do this on a
surface<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.380> picked<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.550> today

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
surface but I picked it up so today

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.300 
surface but I picked it up so today
we're<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:20.860> how<00:02:20.920> smooth<00:02:21.280> that

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
we're not so you can see how smooth that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.870 
we're not so you can see how smooth that
is<00:02:21.670> I'll<00:02:22.150> take<00:02:22.360> my<00:02:22.510> piece<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.900> tape<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:24.700> just

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
is I'll take my piece of tape now just

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.920 
is I'll take my piece of tape now just
kind<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.120> place<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.470> want<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.930> when

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
kind of place it what I want to do when

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.630 
kind of place it what I want to do when
I<00:02:28.959> bend<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.470> here<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.040> want<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.310> bend<00:02:30.549> it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
I bend it here is I want to bend it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.780 
I bend it here is I want to bend it
towards<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.120> middle<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:33.100> only<00:02:33.280> going<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.519> do

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
towards the middle it's only going to do

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.570 
towards the middle it's only going to do
just<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.239> touch<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> basically<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.370> want

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
just a touch but I basically just want

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.690 
just a touch but I basically just want
to<00:02:36.640> bend<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.880> towards<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.330> middle<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
to bend it towards the middle of the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.550 
to bend it towards the middle of the
tail<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:39.910> there<00:02:40.150> see<00:02:40.510> ok<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.260> put<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
tail right there see ok so I put the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.759 
tail right there see ok so I put the
tape<00:02:41.830> right<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> middle<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.290> end

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
tape right here to the middle of the end

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.120 
tape right here to the middle of the end
point<00:02:45.489> right<00:02:45.700> here<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.330> tail<00:02:46.540> fin<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.950> when

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
point right here on the tail fin so when

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.880 
point right here on the tail fin so when
you<00:02:48.250> push<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.730> rotor<00:02:48.940> /<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.390> only<00:02:49.510> goes

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you push the rotor / it only goes

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.289 
you push the rotor / it only goes
straight<00:02:50.890> out<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.220> middle<00:02:51.430> silk<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.209> will

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
straight out to the middle silk it will

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.479 
straight out to the middle silk it will
curve<00:02:52.510> right<00:02:52.840> but<00:02:53.680> now<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.950> curves<00:02:54.190> right<00:02:54.340> in

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
curve right but now it curves right in

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.039 
curve right but now it curves right in
big<00:02:54.670> circles<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.600> now<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:57.070> goes<00:02:57.220> left<00:02:57.489> in

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
big circles and now it goes left in

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.350 
big circles and now it goes left in
sharper<00:02:59.049> circles<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.610> mean<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.090> looks<00:03:01.299> a

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
sharper circles and so I mean it looks a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.479 
sharper circles and so I mean it looks a
little<00:03:01.540> unfair<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.769> have<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.070> right<00:03:03.220> all<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
little unfair to have the right all and

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.070 
little unfair to have the right all and
go<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.730> far<00:03:03.970> over<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.450> left<00:03:04.630> go<00:03:04.810> all<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
go that far over and the left go all the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.020 
go that far over and the left go all the
way<00:03:05.110> over<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.400> notice<00:03:06.519> again<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
way over but if you notice again the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.930 
way over but if you notice again the
angle<00:03:07.570> right<00:03:08.049> here<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:09.190> know<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.430> started<00:03:09.700> out

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
angle right here you know we started out

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.220 
angle right here you know we started out
a<00:03:09.970> little<00:03:10.060> unfair<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.720> right<00:03:10.900> hand<00:03:11.140> side

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
a little unfair to the right hand side

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.449 
a little unfair to the right hand side
so<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.739> kind<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.010> evens<00:03:12.310> out<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
so this just kind of evens out the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.000 
so this just kind of evens out the
playing<00:03:12.580> field<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.330> makes<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.380> airplane<00:03:14.799> as

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
playing field and makes this airplane as

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.910 
playing field and makes this airplane as
if<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:15.310> was<00:03:15.489> straight<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:17.560> will<00:03:17.739> allow

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
if this was straight and that will allow

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.410 
if this was straight and that will allow
you<00:03:17.980> greater<00:03:18.340> greater<00:03:18.790> flexibility<00:03:19.299> and

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
you greater greater flexibility and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.750 
you greater greater flexibility and
doing<00:03:19.630> stunts<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:21.280> these<00:03:21.459> guys<00:03:21.610> do

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
doing stunts and like these guys do

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.670 
doing stunts and like these guys do
going<00:03:22.000> underneath<00:03:22.269> tables<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.019> chairs<00:03:23.290> and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
going underneath tables and chairs and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.920 
going underneath tables and chairs and
it<00:03:24.489> just<00:03:24.730> allows<00:03:24.940> for<00:03:25.150> greater<00:03:25.329> flexibility

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
it just allows for greater flexibility

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.890 
it just allows for greater flexibility
where<00:03:26.079> this<00:03:26.170> one<00:03:26.410> goes<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.769> far

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
where this one goes that far

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:38.200 
where this one goes that far
and<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.319> goes<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.650> way<00:03:28.799> over

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.270
