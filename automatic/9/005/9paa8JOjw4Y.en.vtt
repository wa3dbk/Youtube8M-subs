 of corn to make these tamales 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.490
 we're going to need salt to taste for 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.940
 to knead the corn flour is already carried 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.710
 a good time spending it 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.230

 I'm using half a kilo but how 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.480
 I'm going to double the double exposure 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.700
 that's why for the stews I'm going to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.700
 make chicken that's why 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.840
 with half a kilo but you can buy the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.300
 amount you want there depends on each 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.230
 taste of the person 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.690

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.650
 other enchiladas with white dough 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.650
 It depends on your taste 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.620
 and this so that it comes out very fluffy nothing 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:43.689
 more you have to discuss it very well the oil 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:47.410
 of corn is very healthy and does not do so much 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.870
 damage like butter 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.480
 the body but because you want to do it 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.200
