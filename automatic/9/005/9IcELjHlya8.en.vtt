00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.409
 do not 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.270
 most people have the idea of 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.970
 that drones today are used to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.869
 military courses and there are uses that are 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.850
 completely different and that are more 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.830
 in the day to day that we live 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.490
 who are fighting a war in 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.490
 Afghanistan 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.010
 and the use of drones for delivery is something 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.410
 Today is feasible technically 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.150
 problem is not the skill of lyon in 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.660
 deliver something you have to have everything 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.510
 well-thought system of control and of 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.670
 security until we can have a 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.340
 drone delivering for example a gift to 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.790
 your son in your garden but what is 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.830
 interesting is something that is very light and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.390
 which has a very high value between the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.430
 delivery of documents is something super 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.520
 interesting but I think the use of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.970
 drones for delivery is going to start with that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.220
 idea of ​​delivering to those who have to 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 they are very light but they have a value 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.580
 very high 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.170
 if you've seen a movie 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.030
 last three or four years almost certainly 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.409
 have used a drone somewhere to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.600
 do any of the scenes 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.159
 and what we did before we have 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.170
 a very big helicopter and I paid him 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.590
 $ 10,000 per day to have a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.939
 helicopter a pilot and a guy 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.909
 controlling in the camera the problem is 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.770
 that does not allow you to do certain shopping 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.299
 you can always sign someone super 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.920
 close what you allow those of 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.979
 organization complement to the helicopter 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.189
 normal you can enter for example in 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.750
 from a house and you will fly through the door and 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.240
 shelley for outside and strips for outside 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.219
 from the house from the top and that's 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.439
 something that is impossible to do in a 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.439
 single scene with normal helicopter 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.170
 what they want most they have nothing 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.810
 what to see with privacy is something that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.280
 can you come to life all of you for 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.680
 example a fire in building is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.030
 completely fire as you do to 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.680
 to know 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.150
 what's happening on the roof that 's 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.770
 where for example firefighters can 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.500
 enter the building with there is an accident 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.190
 on the road the drones goes up takes off 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.020
 several photos and videos in five minutes 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.819
 land and immediately the police 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.650
 I would have a 3d model of what happened 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.840
 photos and videos in less about will chase 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.680
 to people but always have another pair of 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.680
 eyes in the sky 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.030
 If you have a plantation that is 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.040
 huge that has several kilometers of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.050
 long how do you do to know what is 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.800
 happening with the plants that are in 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.750
 middle of the phase 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.590
 the satellite project is that for example 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.500
 In U.S.A 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.750
 more than 50% of the time the place where 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.690
 you are in the USA to have clouds so it is 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.910
 impossible to have a picture of your place 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.209
 planes are expensive with perfect drones 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.030
 for that is something that small and good 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.430
 it only has higher resolution because 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.190
 fly lower in everything with that you can 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.769
 take several pictures of a plantation and 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.540
 you have a map in real time almost from 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.540
 what is happening in your plantation 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.989
 of plan that mining has for example 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.810
 in australia they have huge mines 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.700
 huge and they are all automatic the use 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.530
 of drones is something interesting to be able to 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.480
 monitor what is happening in the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.580
 mine from thousands of kilometers of 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.430
 industrial inspection distance is another 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.200
 interesting thing if you have an amd 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.939
 and what in English is called a pipeline 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.609
 that goes from alaska to vancouver in phases 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.920
 to monitor all that seat that 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.750
 has thousands and thousands of kilometers today in 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.939
 what they do is a person water and 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.590
 they monitor what they do next 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:17.009
 with a drone in the same thing all 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.989
 days goes to grandmother and with everything he read and went 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.329
 taking videos and photos and with that you have 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.310
 an information costs you nothing costs 20 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.620
 dollars who knows what will happen in 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.020
 two or three years what we want to be 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.320
 sure us as another country and that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.949
 we are enabling the possibility of 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.949
 do something creative
