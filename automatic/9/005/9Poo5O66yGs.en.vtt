bring<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:22.130> characters<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.550> little<00:04:22.790> more

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
bring the characters a little more

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.360 
bring the characters a little more
forward<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.750> not<00:04:23.900> have<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.410> half<00:04:24.770> step<00:04:25.130> in

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
forward and not have that half step in

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.120 
forward and not have that half step in
between<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:26.690> player<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.770> know<00:04:27.860> Rainer

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
between the player and you know Rainer

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.120 
between the player and you know Rainer
for<00:04:28.430> instance<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:29.630> we've<00:04:30.350> kind<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.710> done<00:04:30.770> away

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
for instance so we've kind of done away

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.470 
for instance so we've kind of done away
with<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.400> but<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.850> does<00:04:32.030> pose<00:04:32.210> an<00:04:32.360> interesting

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
with it but it does pose an interesting

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.030
