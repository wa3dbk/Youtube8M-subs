this bucket and this pot it holds those

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
this bucket and this pot it holds those
positions<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.660> want<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> take<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
positions so like if I want to take a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.170 
positions so like if I want to take a
look<00:02:22.200> armor<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.370> stacked<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.030> just

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
look armor this one stacked I can just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270 
look armor this one stacked I can just
like<00:02:24.300> click<00:02:24.510> click<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.590> bank<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> EOC

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
like click click in the bank in the EOC

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
like click click in the bank in the EOC
I<00:02:26.580> think<00:02:27.000> when<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.240> click<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.320> ship

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
I think when you click it it like ship

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.830 
I think when you click it it like ship
shifts<00:02:29.340> position<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.000> slides<00:02:30.240> back<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
shifts position so it slides back and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.820 
shifts position so it slides back and
then<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> have<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> wait<00:02:31.380> second<00:02:31.710> before

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
then you have to wait second before

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.850 
then you have to wait second before
bring<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.310> next<00:02:32.340> thing<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.510> like

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
bring it the next thing so I really like

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.070 
eye to let's get this back in here so
I've<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:38.700> gems<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.870> got<00:02:39.960> from

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
I've just got some gems just got from

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.490 
I've just got some gems just got from
random<00:02:40.350> events<00:02:40.620> mostly<00:02:41.930> some<00:02:42.930> bull<00:02:43.110> strings<00:02:43.350> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
random events mostly some bull strings I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.200 
random events mostly some bull strings I
was<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:43.980> stringing<00:02:44.430> some<00:02:44.550> flax<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.090> for

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
was there stringing some flax just for

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.310 
was there stringing some flax just for
money<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.690> actually<00:02:45.780> quite<00:02:45.960> good<00:02:46.050> money

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
money that was actually quite good money

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.930 
money that was actually quite good money
I<00:02:46.410> think<00:02:46.590> these<00:02:46.710> are<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:46.950> 100<00:02:47.400> each<00:02:47.760> or

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
I think these are like 100 each or

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.100 
I think these are like 100 each or
something<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.300> maybe<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:48.960> I'm<00:02:49.080> lucky

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
something like that maybe if I'm lucky

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.220 
something like that maybe if I'm lucky
and<00:02:49.910> some<00:02:50.910> crafted<00:02:51.270> supply<00:02:51.510> some<00:02:51.810> herb<00:02:51.990> lore

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
and some crafted supply some herb lore

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.400 
and some crafted supply some herb lore
drops<00:02:52.940> some<00:02:53.940> vitals<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.630> bought<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
drops some vitals that I bought when the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.260 
drops some vitals that I bought when the
shops<00:02:55.710> were<00:02:56.040> infinite<00:02:56.760> stock<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.090> think

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
shops were infinite stock I think

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.640 
shops were infinite stock I think
they're<00:02:57.390> actually<00:02:57.450> still<00:02:57.810> infinite<00:02:58.200> stock<00:02:58.410> so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
they're actually still infinite stock so

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.250 
they're actually still infinite stock so
stock<00:02:58.920> up<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.160> vales<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.640> herb<00:02:59.760> lore<00:03:00.260> it's

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
5,000 times x let's go 550 think it's

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.959 
5,000 times x let's go 550 think it's
