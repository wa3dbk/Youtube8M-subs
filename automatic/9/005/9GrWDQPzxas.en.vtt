00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
tough kind of question there is a full

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.509 
tough kind of question there is a full
tutorial<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.309> three<00:00:47.429> to

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
tutorial here I think about three to

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.180 
tutorial here I think about three to
four<00:00:47.640> minutes<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> finish<00:00:48.179> it's<00:00:48.449> not<00:00:48.570> too<00:00:48.690> bad

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
four minutes to finish it's not too bad

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.290 
four minutes to finish it's not too bad
we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> championship<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.030> blocked

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we have the championship that's blocked

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.880 
we have the championship that's blocked
right<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.710> demo

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
right now because this is just the demo

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.029 
right now because this is just the demo
and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.519> we'll<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.820> into<00:00:53.850> arcade<00:00:54.839> here<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and then we'll go into arcade here and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.369 
and then we'll go into arcade here and
load<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.429> up<00:00:56.579> low<00:00:56.760> times<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.690> bad<00:00:57.899> that's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
load this up low times that's bad that's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.630 
load this up low times that's bad that's
the<00:00:58.440> fastest<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.039> disclosed<00:00:59.370> either

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the fastest not disclosed either

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.489 
the fastest not disclosed either
graphics<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.660> nice<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.289> though

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
graphics are really nice on this though

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.220 
graphics are really nice on this though
I<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:02.010> say<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.370> much<00:01:02.429> I<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.749> enjoy<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
with the nice explosions so you move

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
with the nice explosions so you move
your<00:01:09.930> ship<00:01:10.110> around<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> kind<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
your ship around here there is a kind of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
your ship around here there is a kind of
an<00:01:11.579> odd<00:01:11.759> delay<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.220> quick

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
an odd delay and it's not as quick

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520 
an odd delay and it's not as quick
responding<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.329> some<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> other<00:01:15.840> chump

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
responding as some of the other chump

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
responding as some of the other chump
type<00:01:16.890> games<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> we've<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
type games that we've had and then you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.810 
type games that we've had and then you
can<00:01:18.659> control<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.290> weapons<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.189> way<00:01:20.399> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
can control your weapons this way and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
can control your weapons this way and
you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.750> switch<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.799> there's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you can switch them like that so there's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.649 
you can switch them like that so there's
a<00:01:23.399> little<00:01:23.520> button<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.329> can<00:01:24.450> switch

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
a little button here you can switch

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
a little button here you can switch
between<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:26.460> gives<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.700> obviously<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
between them this gives you obviously a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
between them this gives you obviously a
more<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.329> a<00:01:27.420> spread<00:01:27.810> look<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
more of a spread look and then you can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280 
more of a spread look and then you can
control<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> direction<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.750> bullets<00:01:31.049> move

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
control the direction the bullets move

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
control the direction the bullets move
into<00:01:31.649> with<00:01:32.070> what's<00:01:32.250> called<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> satellite

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
into with what's called the satellite

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
into with what's called the satellite
here<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.439> actually<00:01:34.560> move<00:01:34.829> these

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
here you can actually move these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.649 
here you can actually move these
controllers<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> settings<00:01:36.180> which<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> kind

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
controllers and settings which is kind

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.950 
controllers and settings which is kind
of<00:01:36.689> nice<00:01:38.030> I'll<00:01:39.030> zoom<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.659> little<00:01:39.810> bit

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
of nice I'll zoom in here a little bit

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.569 
of nice I'll zoom in here a little bit
you<00:01:40.259> guys<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> closer<00:01:40.829> look

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.429 

so<00:01:45.579> enemies<00:01:46.119> come<00:01:46.329> in<00:01:46.479> waves<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.350> gets

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
so enemies come in waves and it gets

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.399 
so enemies come in waves and it gets
progressively<00:01:47.649> harder<00:01:48.250> obviously<00:01:52.289> as<00:01:53.289> you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
progressively harder obviously as you

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.660 
progressively harder obviously as you
see<00:01:53.560> i<00:01:53.590> think<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.920> graphics<00:01:54.310> look<00:01:54.399> absolutely

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
see i think the graphics look absolutely

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.669 
see i think the graphics look absolutely
fantastic<00:01:54.939> for<00:01:55.479> this<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.289> know<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.530> it

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
fantastic for this I you know is it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.429
