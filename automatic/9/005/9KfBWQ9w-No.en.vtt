00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.020
 Well, here we have our 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.120
 Rubik's Cube 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.010
 and nothing with this one 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.240
 vieri to what happens is interested to solve in a 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.799
 ana teresa almada 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.829
 simple the cube 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:16.119
 of ante steps of operations also asks quite simple then 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.009
 first of all explain bouquets 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.739
 because I'm going to take the white face as a reference 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.319
 I'm good and people say it's because the hardest the easiest is in the 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.319
 unequal combat zones are the ones taken by the template 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.869
 what serves as a reference 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.340
 it will not serve as 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.720
 as reference 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.170
 per cent of ciro is fine that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.710
 the color of the hair face to face indicates the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.240
 thousands the color that is going to see in the whole face I explain myself percent is in 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.570
 white to all this be white they are aware of these farms to bethesda 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.810
 and so for the rest 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.060
 the first goal the first step 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.390
 the stop will exceed the cube is to get 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790
 a cross 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.860
 this case we get a cross 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.980
 White color 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.180
 and not only that, but you have to have a cross and then you have to have 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.350
 the same color here 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.540
 the mec 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.329
 you have white here you have to have a target here to get the cross 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.899
 and then you'll have to have meets a farm and orange because you fear indicate the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.970
 there are so many 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.860
 lie lark white blue afp 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 here we have to have plan with white red red 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 here white white green green 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.550
 White White 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.660
 The NASA 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.920
 the base the most rain at the moment because it's the last 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.910
 what will we solve 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.000
 then by the way here turns 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 we said 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.079
 how do you get that 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.660
 lie that something rhythms 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.970
 hill and clear simple way 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.390
 we do not have to look at the base and at the bottom this is the afp the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.450
 lower part 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.410
 and the peace 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.060
 and there look for plan 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 we have here a flank that is at the bottom 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.490
 This case can serve us because we have to look for a 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.380
 White 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.520
 this the bottom on any of the faces 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.659
 it was the base 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.489
 but important that it is 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.549
 in the middle 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.650
 So many of these first stops are quite simple and what 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.799
 you will get 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.649
 in shape 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.129
 this for example is from the hole I have not resolved but suppose I do not have 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
 solved well ironed the barb 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.239
 here we have this case called watching it 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.689
 we had the target down here and it's right in the middle seeing what we're looking for 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.639
 is that the color 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.089
 in fact nothing at the moment the color 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.999
 that indicates us below 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.870
 so we want a white in the lower part as I said and in the part 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.609
 below we have 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.929
 a blue but 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:54.639
 then not what we want to upload it here and match it with these 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.300
 sacristan 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.229
 Maybe it's done under the valley 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.529
 then capitals and it's nice 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.969
 base said what you have to do is search with white is you like 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.710
 the one that the color that indicates Alava 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.660
 then to pulls and fifth thoroughly the bottom part looking at it so the part 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.479
 down 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.019
 we turn it 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.339
 what is this part 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.229
 and finally 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.789
 we will have 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.089
 our blue color 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:23.859
 perfect we go for the next 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.969
 we look for this one 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.429
 we just have white in the part of the base and in the center 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:32.689
 in the middle 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.219
 d will highlight 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.029
 and then what you have to do is 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.189
 get the bank up here and in anantapur india with this one but that 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.949
 Go here 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.799
 this case is simpler than the previous one since in the previous one we had 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.379
 interleaved the colors 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.430
 in total this case the only thing that needs to be done 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.859
 we have two colors and then the white here 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.279
 it's true twice 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.179
 and then we have it 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:56.659
 I can repeat 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.139
 we have here this 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.419
 let's go harris we have two blue colors 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.509
 orange 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.289
 and white white for 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.469
 make our club 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.309
 we keep looking 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.469
 we have this 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.069
 irak and the green therefore like more the face of the former prefect of the tribe 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.549
 this case 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.249
 It is not crazy to lose points but it is composed of white and they apply 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:21.989
 It was kind of cute 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.989
 let's say so 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:29.279
 we have 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.590
 this one white oranges 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.559
 White 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.969
 blue is left 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.599
 the last 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:36.600
 how did he get it? 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.550
 I do not have in comply with 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.000
 at the bottom that is to say but the emirates it has to be 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.139
 in the parts 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.539
 medium 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.590
 so 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.039
 What I do is 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:50.949
 I lower it 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.120
 so that this one 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.529
 where I want 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.419
 perfect and I have it apart from the base 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.050
 and with the two colors 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.249
 sets what we do is 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.469
 twice and then we will have our cross 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.139
 with all colors 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.040
 perfect slope 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.040
 will allow the first part to resolve in Moscow 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.469
 second part 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:22.819
 you have to get 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.990
 6 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.140
 on each side of the color that indicates na 'the piece of the month' 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.289
 have to get green 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.030
 here a technique to orange here a blue art 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.030
 and finally an art 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.509
 how do you do this 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.629
 well, we keep focusing 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.039
 simoes watching 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.469
 the base and from yesterday to search 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.809
 the color 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:53.930
 we have 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.449
 a red on this side 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.400
 in Moscow the ful on this side 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.089
 this series the red face was followed blue face 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:03.490
 It entices that getting a chip is from the corner 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.490
 you have to get a file 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.759
 Red 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.039
 a poster that has the three colors in the sixth placement 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.680
 we look for it on the part 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.349
 of the base by the bottom 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.639
 let's see if we find it 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.919
 it's not enough 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.050
 that is well opposed to the other that is not work that I am looking for 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.960
 In this case, what we do is find another one that could be 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.490
 we have the green 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.669
 red and white there 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.180
 should go a tab that has see people have red that we have 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.909
 we already have here 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.990
 Well now how do you upload this piece here 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:52.629
 the movement would have to be tels this 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.589
 to get the red on this side and the truth on this side 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.899
 I lost and the Great Dane of the opera hundred this movement 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.899
 we would lose the pizaña 

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:05.520
 guardians 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.610
 'the piece of the month' 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.379
 How to keep piece of the medium 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.309
 and so that it keeps saved as already said so that they are agile and this 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.059
 movement 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:19.520
 let's not lose this white 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.720
 then what we do is keep the detention 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:25.669
 and now yes
