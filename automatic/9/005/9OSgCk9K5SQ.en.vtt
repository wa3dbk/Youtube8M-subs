00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 at the moment the only team that is 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.170
 driving away is just the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.240

 we were just saying, in short, called one 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.880
 transfer where it has always been 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 as I was saying in the process 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.809
 purely this goal we saw 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.879
