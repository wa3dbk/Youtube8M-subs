00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.070 
this one you can put any slab here but
you<00:01:55.580> don't<00:01:55.700> want<00:01:55.880> want<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.210> go<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.690> one

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
you don't want want to go on this one

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.260 
you don't want want to go on this one
because<00:01:57.860> there's<00:01:58.640> going<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.790> be<00:01:58.850> redstone

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
because there's going to be redstone

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.880 
because there's going to be redstone
here<00:01:59.540> so<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:00.320> just<00:02:00.380> going<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.740> flood

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
here so that it's just going to flood

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.980 
here so that it's just going to flood
the<00:02:01.010> red<00:02:01.159> stone<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.610> I'll<00:02:01.940> be<00:02:01.970> gone<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.780> that

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the red stone and I'll be gone so that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.880 
the red stone and I'll be gone so that
one<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.260> don't<00:02:03.290> want<00:02:03.650> it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
one you don't want it

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.640 
one you don't want it
this<00:02:04.220> side<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.580> okay<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.540> side<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:06.590> little

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
this side is okay this side this little

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.619 
this side is okay this side this little
little<00:02:07.250> lever<00:02:07.550> goes<00:02:07.760> or<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.300> button

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
little lever goes or the button

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.630 
little lever goes or the button
whichever<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.200> want<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.280> has<00:02:10.340> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
whichever you want so what that has to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.420 
whichever you want so what that has to
be<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.759> slug<00:02:11.060> there<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.379> second<00:02:13.040> one<00:02:13.159> but

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
be a slug there on the second one but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.530 
be a slug there on the second one but
the<00:02:13.549> rest<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.909> can<00:02:14.030> be<00:02:14.060> water<00:02:14.299> as<00:02:14.629> shown

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the rest of it can be water as shown

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
the rest of it can be water as shown
right<00:02:15.629> here<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.209> after<00:02:18.209> we've<00:02:18.540> done<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
right here so after we've done this the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.470 
right here so after we've done this the
next<00:02:19.769> step<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.370> add<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> red<00:02:21.359> to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
next step is to actually add the red to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.690 
next step is to actually add the red to
turn<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.439> we<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.859> the<00:02:23.010> lever<00:02:23.189> here<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
turn in so we have the lever here and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.509 
turn in so we have the lever here and
I've<00:02:24.629> just<00:02:24.870> mined<00:02:25.049> out<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:26.010> how

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
I've just mined out so you can see how

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.020 
I've just mined out so you can see how
the<00:02:26.579> Redstone<00:02:27.000> work<00:02:27.209> so<00:02:28.069> goes<00:02:29.069> over<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.819> and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the Redstone work so goes over here and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.110 
the Redstone work so goes over here and
under<00:02:30.959> here<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:32.159> need<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.579> 1<00:02:32.879> redstone

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
under here and we need the 1 redstone

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
under here and we need the 1 redstone
repeater<00:02:33.629> there<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.439> we<00:02:34.500> got<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.709> eight

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
repeater there and we got the eight

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.099 
repeater there and we got the eight
Pistons<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.519> each<00:02:35.730> redstone<00:02:36.390> repeater<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
Pistons that each redstone repeater the

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.789 
Pistons that each redstone repeater the
other<00:02:37.799> eight<00:02:38.060> connecting<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.239> each<00:02:39.269> piston

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
other eight connecting to each piston

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.170 
other eight connecting to each piston
the<00:02:40.799> redstone<00:02:41.189> this<00:02:41.519> needs<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.849> be<00:02:41.939> here

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the redstone this needs to be here

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.339 
the redstone this needs to be here
because<00:02:42.650> without<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.829> if<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.969> do<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:46.170> put<00:02:46.319> a

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
because without it if I do just put a

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.500 
because without it if I do just put a
redstone<00:02:46.590> ER<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:47.400> doesn't<00:02:47.730> reach<00:02:47.879> all<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.209> it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
redstone ER it doesn't reach all of it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
redstone ER it doesn't reach all of it
because<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.079> believe<00:02:49.560> redstone<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.159> only

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
because I believe redstone can only

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.270 
because I believe redstone can only
reach<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.700> 16<00:02:51.450> places<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.129> add<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
reach like 16 places so if you add a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.129 
reach like 16 places so if you add a
redstone<00:02:53.549> repeater<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:54.180> actually<00:02:54.659> reaches

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
redstone repeater here actually reaches

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.250 
redstone repeater here actually reaches
all<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.439> it<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.709> then<00:02:55.919> there<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.989> when

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
all of it and then there you go so when

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.289 
all of it and then there you go so when
you<00:02:58.739> can<00:02:58.889> actually<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.459> as<00:02:59.579> well<00:02:59.730> on<00:03:00.000> this

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
you can actually do it as well on this

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.659 
you can actually do it as well on this
layer<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.049> want<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.069> feel<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
layer if you want but I feel like this

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.220 
layer if you want but I feel like this
layer<00:03:02.879> is<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> bit<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.439> mess<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:05.010> me<00:03:05.159> because

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
layer is a bit of a mess for me because

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.030 
layer is a bit of a mess for me because
sometimes<00:03:07.230> when<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.409> want<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.590> clear<00:03:07.859> this

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
sometimes when you want to clear this

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.000 
sometimes when you want to clear this
bit<00:03:08.280> water<00:03:09.150> comes<00:03:09.450> down<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:10.019> floods<00:03:10.769> all<00:03:10.889> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
bit water comes down and floods all the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.190 
bit water comes down and floods all the
redstone<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:11.879> gets<00:03:12.000> messed<00:03:12.299> up<00:03:12.450> so

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
redstone and it all gets messed up so

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.750 
redstone and it all gets messed up so
yeah<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:13.829> how<00:03:13.889> you<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.609> then

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
yeah that's how you do this bit and then

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.210 
yeah that's how you do this bit and then
this<00:03:14.939> is<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.359> end<00:03:15.900> design<00:03:16.769> now<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> may<00:03:17.189> be

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
this is the end design now you may be

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.559 
this is the end design now you may be
wondering<00:03:17.340> because<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.030> haven't<00:03:18.150> explained

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
wondering because I haven't explained

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.920 
wondering because I haven't explained
why<00:03:18.750> you've<00:03:19.349> got<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.620> use<00:03:19.739> slabs<00:03:20.069> here<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
why you've got to use slabs here and so

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.059 
why you've got to use slabs here and so
where<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.169> girlie<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:22.349> slab<00:03:22.709> see<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:22.949> is

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
where you girlie you slab see it is

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.300 
where you girlie you slab see it is
because<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.150> little<00:03:24.479> redstone<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.310> if

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
because of this little redstone here if

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.339 
because of this little redstone here if
you<00:03:26.489> use<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.849> full<00:03:27.090> block<00:03:27.419> so<00:03:27.780> full<00:03:28.139> block

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
you use the full block so full block

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.379 
you use the full block so full block
would<00:03:28.530> be<00:03:28.560> doubt<00:03:28.919> that<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.760> redstone<00:03:30.150> stops

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
would be doubt that the redstone stops

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.899 
would be doubt that the redstone stops
working<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:31.109> lattice<00:03:31.470> activates<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
working the lattice activates and the

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.819 
working the lattice activates and the
level<00:03:33.180> stops<00:03:33.359> working<00:03:33.599> but<00:03:34.260> if<00:03:34.379> you<00:03:34.470> put<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.769> a

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
level stops working but if you put on a

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.399 
level stops working but if you put on a
slab<00:03:35.190> for<00:03:35.669> some<00:03:35.849> reason<00:03:36.209> maybe<00:03:37.019> because<00:03:37.109> it's

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
slab for some reason maybe because it's

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.740 
slab for some reason maybe because it's
not<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.859> tall<00:03:38.010> block<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:39.209> actually<00:03:39.540> still

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
not that tall block it actually still

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.250 
not that tall block it actually still
goes<00:03:39.930> down<00:03:40.109> works<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.909> works<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.449> if<00:03:43.109> you

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
goes down works so that works and if you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.289 
goes down works so that works and if you
want<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.470> make<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> look<00:03:43.829> nice<00:03:44.129> and<00:03:44.370> fancy<00:03:44.549> then

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
want to make it look nice and fancy then

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.170 
want to make it look nice and fancy then
you<00:03:45.629> put<00:03:45.959> slabs<00:03:46.260> all<00:03:46.500> around<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:47.430> can<00:03:47.790> also

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you put slabs all around you can also

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.539 
you put slabs all around you can also
put<00:03:48.690> hoppers<00:03:49.109> here<00:03:49.409> and<00:03:49.650> connect<00:03:50.220> them<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.519> a

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
put hoppers here and connect them to a

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.180 
put hoppers here and connect them to a
chest<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.449> that<00:03:51.690> um<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.500> works<00:03:52.680> i'ma<00:03:52.949> show<00:03:53.129> you

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
chest so that um it works i'ma show you

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.759 
chest so that um it works i'ma show you
that<00:03:53.459> quickly<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.840> can<00:03:54.870> remember<00:03:55.229> how<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.500> do

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
that quickly if I can remember how to do

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.179 
that quickly if I can remember how to do
it<00:03:55.889> so<00:03:56.639> I<00:03:56.669> need<00:03:56.879> that<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.479> chest<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:59.010> if<00:03:59.069> we

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
it so I need that and a chest so if we

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.530 
it so I need that and a chest so if we
put<00:03:59.430> down<00:04:00.199> chest<00:04:01.199> here<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:03.000> connect

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
put down chest here and then connect

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.969 
put down chest here and then connect
hoppers<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.229> it<00:04:04.349> like<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:09.439> done<00:04:10.439> like

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
hoppers to it like this and done like

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.929 
hoppers to it like this and done like
that<00:04:11.819> then<00:04:12.509> say<00:04:13.439> like<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:13.979> that's<00:04:14.639> there

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
that then say like that's that's there

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:15.559 
that then say like that's that's there
the<00:04:15.090> hopper

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
the hopper

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.289 
the hopper
if<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.739> water<00:04:16.919> activates<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.639> we'll<00:04:17.909> get<00:04:18.180> all

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
if the water activates it we'll get all

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.210 
if the water activates it we'll get all
the<00:04:18.419> seeds<00:04:18.659> of<00:04:19.109> push<00:04:19.409> it<00:04:19.560> into<00:04:19.889> one<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.159> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
the seeds of push it into one of the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.560 
the seeds of push it into one of the
hoppers<00:04:20.519> which<00:04:20.669> will<00:04:20.820> collect<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.419> and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
hoppers which will collect it and

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.750 
hoppers which will collect it and
hopefully<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.800> hopper<00:04:23.039> should<00:04:23.340> be<00:04:23.490> in<00:04:23.639> the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
hopefully the hopper should be in the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.550 
hopefully the hopper should be in the
chest<00:04:23.969> which<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.419> so<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.260> make<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
chest which it is so you can make it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.399 
chest which it is so you can make it
like<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.740> but<00:04:26.460> um<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:26.909> I<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.139> this

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
like that but um and I like I like this

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.420 
like that but um and I like I like this
design<00:04:28.620> at<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.099> end

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
design at the end

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.650 
design at the end
this<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.449> over<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:30.960> we<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:31.949> fly<00:04:32.250> faster<00:04:32.660> put

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
this one over here we can fly faster put

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.300 
this one over here we can fly faster put
in<00:04:33.780> here<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.169> like<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.680> design<00:04:34.860> because<00:04:35.190> it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
in here I like this design because it

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.159 
in here I like this design because it
just<00:04:35.460> looks<00:04:35.610> nice<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.780> literally

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
just looks nice and you can literally

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.510 
just looks nice and you can literally
just<00:04:37.320> pick<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.590> all<00:04:37.830> up<00:04:37.860> anyway<00:04:38.100> because

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
just pick it all up anyway because

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.890 
just pick it all up anyway because
you're<00:04:38.970> going<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.180> need<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.360> replant<00:04:39.660> all<00:04:39.810> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
you're going to need to replant all the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.900 
you're going to need to replant all the
seed<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.229> get<00:04:40.410> 48<00:04:40.919> from<00:04:41.039> up<00:04:41.250> which<00:04:41.820> is

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
seed so you get 48 from up which is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.070 
seed so you get 48 from up which is
pretty<00:04:42.060> good<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.360> get<00:04:42.449> a<00:04:42.509> couple<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:42.870> seeds

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
pretty good you get a couple of seeds

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.200 
pretty good you get a couple of seeds
and<00:04:43.289> you<00:04:43.410> can<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.710> replant<00:04:44.070> them<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.520> start

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
and you can just replant them and start

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.620 
and you can just replant them and start
over<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:46.310> if<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.430> wondering<00:04:47.729> why<00:04:47.850> it's<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.090> you

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
over and if you wondering why it's a you

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.180 
over and if you wondering why it's a you
can't<00:04:48.930> make<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.259> bigger<00:04:49.470> unless<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.009> add

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
can't make it bigger unless you add

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.640 
can't make it bigger unless you add
water<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:50.759> because<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.870> water<00:04:52.110> sauce<00:04:52.380> can

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
water in because the water sauce can

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.320 
water in because the water sauce can
actually<00:04:52.979> only<00:04:53.220> reach<00:04:53.550> four<00:04:53.910> blocks<00:04:54.180> I

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
actually only reach four blocks I

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.650 
actually only reach four blocks I
believe<00:04:54.600> so<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:56.520> reaches<00:04:56.850> four<00:04:57.090> blocks<00:04:57.330> if<00:04:57.539> you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
believe so it reaches four blocks if you

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.719 
believe so it reaches four blocks if you
do<00:04:57.810> one<00:04:58.199> water<00:04:58.380> source<00:04:58.650> at<00:04:58.740> each<00:04:58.860> side<00:04:59.160> then

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
do one water source at each side then

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.360 
do one water source at each side then
that<00:05:00.120> will<00:05:00.210> be<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.750> all<00:05:01.050> together<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:02.220> yeah

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
that will be a all together so yeah

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.340 
that will be a all together so yeah
thanks<00:05:03.000> for<00:05:03.030> watching<00:05:03.120> this<00:05:03.389> tutorial<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:04.020> I
