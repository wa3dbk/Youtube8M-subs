fissure x' bilaterally here you see a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
fissure x' bilaterally here you see a
little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.360> creeping<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
little bit creeping into one of the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.270 
little bit creeping into one of the
sulci<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.380> inferior<00:01:13.380> frontal<00:01:13.619> lobe<00:01:13.950> and

sulci and the inferior frontal lobe and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
sulci and the inferior frontal lobe and
there's<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.299> blood<00:01:15.540> tracking<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
there's also some blood tracking in the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.760 
there's also some blood tracking in the
intra<00:01:16.619> hemispheric<00:01:17.360> fissure<00:01:18.360> anteriorly

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.960 

okay<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.400> consistent<00:01:23.850> with

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
okay so that's all consistent with

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.810 
okay so that's all consistent with
subarachnoid<00:01:24.360> hemorrhage

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
subarachnoid hemorrhage

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
subarachnoid hemorrhage
all<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> ventricles<00:01:28.040> this<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
all right look in the ventricles this is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.789 
all right look in the ventricles this is
a<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.460> important<00:01:29.880> observation<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.799> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a very important observation to make you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
a very important observation to make you
see<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.400> levels<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
see the little levels there you see the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.819 
see the little levels there you see the
little<00:01:33.689> hyper<00:01:33.930> dense<00:01:34.170> material<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
little hyper dense material the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.060 
little hyper dense material the
ventricle<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.520> goes<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:37.070> so

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
ventricle actually goes back here so

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
ventricle actually goes back here so
this<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.369> bit<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> hyper<00:01:39.180> dense<00:01:39.420> material

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this little bit of hyper dense material

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.060 
this little bit of hyper dense material
here<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.450> blood<00:01:42.649> layering<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
here and here is blood layering out in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.179 
here and here is blood layering out in
the<00:01:44.220> dependent<00:01:44.970> aspect<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.799> lateral

okay<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.610> that's<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.060> all<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.330> findings<00:02:16.630> of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
okay so that's the all the findings of

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.420 
okay so that's the all the findings of
subarachnoid<00:02:17.080> blood<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.800> very<00:02:17.950> often<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
subarachnoid blood and very often the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.240 
subarachnoid blood and very often the
blood<00:02:18.640> gets<00:02:18.880> into<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.210> ventricular<00:02:19.540> system

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
blood gets into the ventricular system

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.210 
blood gets into the ventricular system
what<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.280> want<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.610> also<00:02:21.760> point<00:02:22.150> out<00:02:22.360> here<00:02:22.750> is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
what I want to also point out here is

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.250 
what I want to also point out here is
look<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> size<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.260> lateral

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
look at the size of the lateral

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.680 
look at the size of the lateral
ventricles<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.100> then<00:02:27.970> compare<00:02:28.330> them<00:02:28.540> with

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
ventricles and then compare them with

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.480 
ventricles and then compare them with
what<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.380> salsa<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.860> lateral

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
what you see of the salsa the lateral

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.060 
what you see of the salsa the lateral
ventricles<00:02:31.000> are<00:02:31.270> prominent<00:02:32.550> fairly<00:02:33.550> large

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
ventricles are prominent fairly large

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.560 
ventricles are prominent fairly large
moderately<00:02:36.070> large<00:02:36.250> at<00:02:36.460> least<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.300> salsa

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
moderately large at least and the salsa

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.620 
moderately large at least and the salsa
are<00:02:38.110> completely<00:02:38.650> effaced<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.450> not

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
are completely effaced so this is not

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.480 
are completely effaced so this is not
the<00:02:40.870> baseline<00:02:41.380> level<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.980> these<00:02:42.190> sudden

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the baseline level of these sudden

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.110 
the baseline level of these sudden
ventricles<00:02:43.270> they're<00:02:43.480> usually<00:02:43.660> smaller<00:02:45.120> in

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
ventricles they're usually smaller in

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.630 
ventricles they're usually smaller in
other<00:02:46.240> words<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.470> were<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.920> state<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
other words if this were the state of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.630 
other words if this were the state of
the<00:02:48.760> patient's<00:02:49.270> ventricles<00:02:50.050> normally<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
the patient's ventricles normally you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.740 
the patient's ventricles normally you
would<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:51.880> expect<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.360> 50<00:02:52.750> year<00:02:52.900> old<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.380> have

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
would not expect a 50 year old to have

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.910 
would not expect a 50 year old to have
cortical<00:02:55.750> salsa<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.380> are<00:02:56.530> completely

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
cortical salsa that are completely

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.410 
cortical salsa that are completely
effaced<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.580> would<00:02:57.700> be<00:02:57.850> able<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.090> see<00:02:58.270> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
effaced you would be able to see the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.060 
effaced you would be able to see the
cortical<00:02:58.750> salsa<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.500> tells<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.920> that

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
cortical salsa so this tells you that

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.210 
cortical salsa so this tells you that
this<00:03:00.280> ventricular<00:03:01.270> size<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.350> result<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
this ventricular size is a result of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.729 
this ventricular size is a result of
obstruction<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.320> obstruction<00:03:05.320> from<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
subarachnoid blood which may indicate

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
Luschka on both sides so that would

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.570 
Luschka on both sides so that would
presumably<00:03:28.209> underline<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.290> size<00:03:29.709> underlie

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
presumably underline the size underlie

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.880 
presumably underline the size underlie

increased here and it's important to see

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.940 
increased here and it's important to see
the<00:03:36.489> discrepancy<00:03:37.420> between<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.320> size<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.799> the
