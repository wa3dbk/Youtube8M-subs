00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.080
 at the time of investigations 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.299
 running if the administration of 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.369
 public housing not yet concluded the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.830
 investigation against residents 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:14.020
 allegedly identified as 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.940
 owners of swimming pools that were located east 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.179
 summer in the common areas of the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.919
 residential in violation of subsection l 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.990
 of the lease that 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.300
 promulgates that agency is something that has 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 gone through years and years and the reality is 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.730
 that nobody had done anything about it and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.500
 We proceed to make a campaign 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.130
 orientation most people 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.990
 they have emptied they have stopped filling it 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.780
 Despite that, it has already begun to 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.610
 evaluate how to meet the needs 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.890
 of recreation and entertainment in the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.990
 public housing complexes so they 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.870
 according to lastra power it is not ruled out 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.360
 offer swimming lessons and build 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.460
 swimming pools in the residential 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.900
 We are hoping that this sheet the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.380
 true that a little rain comes and 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.030
 you go and do not have reasoning 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.509
 rationing but what we want to do 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.000
 is to give classes in residential 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:09.280
 inside the residential in swimming pool 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.690
 purchased that are filled and removed 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.660
 we are also thinking about doing 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.940
 pools in residential and third give 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.750
 swimming lessons on the beaches we are going to 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.479
 start a process of using swimming pools 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.700
 removable for swimming lessons and 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.979
 on the beaches the plans of the owner 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.160
 would entail maintenance costs very 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.410
 high as explained lastra power was 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.810
 of today visit in find where did 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.330
 delivery of 81 bars of section 8 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.550
 federal program that was stopped in 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 the delivery of residences since the end 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.210
 from 2012 how much time had I applied 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.399
 7 years ago and I had to follow this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.660
 they expect what the funds then contrary 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.980
 Well, I had been waiting for a 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.370
 Housing 27 years 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.940
 because the food was wrong to improve its 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.100
 quality of life 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.460
 because the americas do not want to stay 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.460
 with me 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.130
 it is estimated that there are more than 8000 people 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.230
 on the waiting list for section 8 and 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.690
 that the second round of voucher delivery 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.300

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.380

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.380
