00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.029
 I propose now to discover the Parisian apartment douars 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.739
 malbois who have a rather special job since he created in 2002 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.220
 a food style office that is to say that offers large 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.530
 food brands to present their products differently while 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.280
 respecting their quality and properties 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520
 he opened the doors of his apartment that like his owner 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.590
 is inspired 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.590
 and amazing 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.190
 I was really given to the little family with four children and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.180
 my wife 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.270
 before wonderful I think so 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.560
 then 7 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.000
 know and appreciate the dispute on July 5th 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.629
 while he lives in exile to whom are growing in particular those 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.440
 this test is conclusive 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.229
 a success as much he can not not even 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.690
 this element 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.190
 Decorative 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 which in my opinion is the high point a place that is this read thirty or so 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.970
 meters long which is one meter tall 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.700
 for the first layer the banana leaf 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.820
 for the end of the year 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 after honda 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.420
 according to this report it is an assembly of paper of exception everything was sewn 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.920
 by hand 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.050
 and after 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.130
 Grondona 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 that idea 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 d 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830
 lift-off 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.910
 I find that to never get tired of watching this work for me it's a 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.260
 little like an order like mitterrand I have a certain time the steps of 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.580
 comparison because it's not at all now 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.580
 and it is this spirit that 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.940
 on the table 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.330
 rather of course the standard in March 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.479
 Frederic Mitterrand covered me by 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.520
 with concrete 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.159
 polished concrete by thin layer so it's all work that worked 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.649
 craft 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.590
 or death nothing is done with materials with advanced technicality 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.489
 thanks to a little bit 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.919
 in my opinion 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.159
 the 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.619
 the second space 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.549
 and there we are really in a job that was really the meeting between 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.229
 the know-how related dividends in this business I've never found the key to 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.729
 hundred 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.790
 of saussure color work 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.790
 as did these people dining in belgium in the second century 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.149
 with at the same time 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.169
 everything can happen 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.459
 200 affiliated centers at armrest level 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.439
 with 621 senses 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.400
 with this concern on this side this patina which is quite exceptional which 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.299
 had gathered 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.529
 I'm glad we were really bolder on the Goal Tour 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
 I almost felt like it was fun 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.239
 in this sense is getting closer to 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.589
 to do this runners 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:05.739
 the material of the videos 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.909
 material servins that is meant for the army finally I can not say more 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.879
 light first time say more because 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.609
 the artists worked on it 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.059
 better she would like to keep a little secret of manufacturing 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.339
 finally 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.029
 when we want to have fun it's not just a matter of money in the final jump 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.809
 to make an idea since the entirety of the curtains cushions ayite cheaper 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.399
 that a master 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.399
 born in the market five days in Paris or elsewhere 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.769
 which is 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 we discover a new space 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.669
 mont-de-marsan in large the injured 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.399
 on this 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.089
 and steel 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.900
 we have not 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.099
 create a whole story an extension of the evening 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.279
 the doctor 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.409
 the lianas 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.689
 ap with a tram stop in this light box of reactors we'll see more 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.219
 late we have the bathroom and we have the opportunity to continue mende continue 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.389
 to enter the munich space 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.099
 the compo begins to open 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.409
 orthe 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.819
 we did not see anything or allies 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.729
 extension of soe 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.019
 despite this work on the liana with 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.109
 this transparency but here we go from plessis 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.969
 see 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.240
 and big hole 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 we vote exactly the extension 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 pia xiii who is a plexi work 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.580
 closes the parents space speak 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.729
 but we find on the other side the wind of enron 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.490
 with the appearance of 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.379
 this centerpiece that wish 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.009
 to believe if we believe 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.330
 brad 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 so we end up in space 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.309
 we do not go anymore 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.889
 % always this extension% later 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.559
 with me I voted for eleven have contributed 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:09.229
 again red and gold mineral is thus open in Morocco 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.009
 with another 530 silver years 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.460
 in turn in his front room for the cw bush 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.240
 and the spirit the butcher 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.610
 we are for a while because we need to be done fairly quickly 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.330
 the family rushes 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.939
 finally a first fifteen minutes of the end with another girl 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.789
 for those on the other side 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.659
 indeed until then chief and the sensuality of the Chinese 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.309
 this ad always recipe 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.309
 in this sense this extension of the general 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.809
 the sao paulo 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.809
 a little shaken 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.360
 the idea is that 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 it's an apartment that has to live with his family 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.029
 I absolutely wanted that 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:04.839
 in a minimum of space four children can appropriate themselves happening 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.180
 when children settle on 75 1 billion euros it's a bit like that 

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.449
 the goal is to do everything to the family 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.779
 this this phantasmagorical universe
