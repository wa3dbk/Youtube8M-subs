00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
real money I'm guessing they're not

real money I'm guessing they're not
going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> cheapest<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.390> depends

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
going to be the cheapest but it depends

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
going to be the cheapest but it depends
how<00:01:57.990> they're<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> work<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.070> might

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
how they're going to work it they might

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.039 
how they're going to work it they might
do<00:01:59.340> cheap<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.790> everyone<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.299> buy<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.750> all

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.389 
do cheap so everyone can buy them all
you<00:02:01.200> mean<00:02:01.320> they<00:02:01.590> might<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.979> quite<00:02:02.280> expensive
