00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 christian is called by update de with the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.870
 first child the asus padfone infiniti 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.200
 which was also due to a few hours 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
 asus here at the mwc in barcelona 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.929
 it is again a combigerÃ¤t presented 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 consisting of pet forum that's me 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.260
 So I learned the smartphone and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.830
 ipad from station namely the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.029
 actual tablet and combined 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.830
 Of course, then it makes one unit 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.930
 and can put the padfone in the pad of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.539
 station insert and get thus 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.730
 a full-fledged tablet as you like it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.380
 already from pat of 1 or the padfone 2 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.149
 However, we were also here again 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.410
 the whole data polished that is called 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 comes with a better equipment 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.180
 a faster cpu and of course, too 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.829
 with a better display and test 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.870
 I'll just start with that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.450
 padfone because this is really that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 the heart of the device itself 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.520
 diagonal of the current padfone feels 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 which is 5 inches dissolves with full hd 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.559
 is a great apps plus as a super 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.329
 ips panel means that means you have a lot 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.280
 high viewing angles the colors 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 become really lifelike 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 reproduced and at first glance 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.460
 is it really brilliant? 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 as pixel clear around the 440 bb achieved 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 which means that really everyone 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.490
 single pixel no longer for 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 the human eye is visible 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.350
 currently running to android 4.1 point 2 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.000
 but we were assured that android 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.040
 4.2 will be available at market launch 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.549
 and driven by the whole of one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.049
 snapdragon 600 cdu with 17 gigahertz so 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.659
 the newest of the new ones on the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.369
 market is and it really looks very 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.380
 very good in contrast to the predecessor 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.799
 you do not have this wedge shape here anymore 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 but the silhouette is actually 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.009
 very simple 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.299
 On the back you have an aluminum 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.430
 finish that means here is really 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.750
 Aluminum has not been used 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.340
 only aluminum look as you would for 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.890
 example of samsung calls but 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.890
 it really is all pure trouble 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.440
 the weight is 141 came the whole so 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.170
 unbelievably around the 86 and 87 mm thick 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.020
 so its about the same as one 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.210
 galaxy s2 and it really feels 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.920
 very good for a 5 inch device 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.110
 It is very good for a opinion in the hand 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.340
 and with the now easy again to 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.289
 this will give you the remaining data 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.970
 I have to show in the upper area 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.830
 of course the front camera with the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.810
 earpiece next to it in the lower area 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.390
 I have three buttons namely capacitive 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.560
 button the homebutton for multitasking 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.050
 button probably nothing right now 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.890
 highlighted and jenson button on the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.420
 bottom I have the micro usb port 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.310
 where it is also something 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.110
 differentiates because this connection is 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.630
 yes also for the pad of station thought 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.209
 and of course you can do that too 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.250
 this padfone indepence station 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.739
 sync then we have one more 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.570
 small microphone on the right side 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.910
 is the rocker for volume 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.260
 up and down the power button and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.670
 a speaker and that's the one too 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.209
 only speaker installed here 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.010
 has been 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.600
 because on the opposite side is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.090
 exactly at this height the sim card slot 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.769
 and here comes a nano in the first time 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.620
 straight to the employment like one already it already 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.049
 So from iphone 5 , that's the second one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.910
 device with a nano are on the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.370
 Back was a 13 megapixel camera 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.709
 integrated with a f20 dazzle the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.570
 means here can really a lot 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.060
 Light invade and bind at 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.470
 darkness can be good 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.540
 then we take another led 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.880
 flash and that's it 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.320
 design is really very clear 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 kept up with some interruptions 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.340
 here in the lower area as the case 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 are the antennas housed there 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.420
 but otherwise it was on the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.700
 top we still have the 3 5 mm 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.180
 jack plug for the headphones and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.730
 otherwise there is nothing left 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.439
 The surface runs bubble typical like 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.349
 you already know it from the predecessors 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.439
 very fluid and here there is 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.060
 really no delay at all 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.640
 Generally this is very much the new 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.769
 android that this one interesting 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.420
 which one also knows a lot from the nexus basis 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.760
 refine that with 1 2 widgets though 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.409
 otherwise it is really relatively clear 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.480
 structured what I just ever 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.480
 if you have the padfone in the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.519
 station comes in an instant 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.049
 change to the tray and this 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.189
 tablet eee pad from station has 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.049
 Meanwhile, a full-HD display 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.489
 that means only 1080p on what 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.939
 The predecessor still criticized 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.980
 that would solve you with 280 x 800 believe 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.759
 me up and meanwhile you have too 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.049
 here a full hd ips panel installed 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.240
 brightness is about 400 not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.370
 that means you can also go under 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.889
 solar radiation still relative 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.880
 work properly with the tablet and 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.250
 you also see under our conditions 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.370
 here it is reasonably good and 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.229
 Here, too, are the perspectives 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.020
 still be very good because it is also one 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.270
 ips-panel was asus here at his 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.860
 devices installed 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.330
 the pad of station has very little 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.639
 connections only loose the ball 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.440
 Then we have a microphone here 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.229
 the power button on the back 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.520
 of course then the integrated petrol where 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.740
 I then in this combination 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.050
 can shoot with pictures and only one 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.290
 speakers in the lower right area 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.699
 I have the micro-usb port 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.210
 Of course, the device to load 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:07.080
 the device will be in 32 and 64 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.330
 gigabytes live from around the 999 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.460
 but mostly become euro or us dollar 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.470
 the 11 are unfair then is then 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.650
 really in the high-priced segment 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.660
 settled is a support and 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.910
 via micro sd is not available here 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.870
 that is when he comes for you for one 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.940
 Decisions are 32 or 64 gigabytes 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.250
 memory is 2gb here too 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.270
 above we have a front camera for 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.130
 video calling but i think 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.960
 maybe only a few will be here 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.030
 otherwise the device is really useful 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.590
 very nice what irritates me something like that 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.210
 Here is the different surfaces 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.610
 Here you will find an aluminum 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.140
 at the penn station here just such a 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.790
 slightly rubberized surface as well 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.670
 taken at the predecessor and in the reason 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.910
 this pad is from station to the 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.400
 except for the resolution of the display yet 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.230
 very identical to that of the predecessor 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.260
 that was it with our first hands-on 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.910
 Thank you very much from Infiniti's pad 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.160
 for us to see a thumbs up like 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.390
 We would always be very happy and we 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.390
 We'll definitely see each other well again at night
