It's Tom Hardy's  golden age!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
After the great success of Inception,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
soon we will see him in the last chapter of Batman,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the British actor is in talks to play Al Capone

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
which recounts the rise of the famous Italian-American gangsters.
