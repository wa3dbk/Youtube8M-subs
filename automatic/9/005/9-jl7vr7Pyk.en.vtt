that I had opened last time so you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.399 
that I had opened last time so you

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
decide whether this is something that

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.610 
decide whether this is something that
you<00:02:19.650> want<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.920> do<00:02:20.069> from<00:02:20.280> time<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.700> time<00:02:21.620> in

you want to do from time to time in

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.000 
you want to do from time to time in
which<00:02:22.860> case<00:02:23.190> I'd<00:02:23.610> suggest<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.360> history

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
which case I'd suggest the history

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.479 
which case I'd suggest the history
restore<00:02:26.010> previous<00:02:26.489> session<00:02:26.940> option<00:02:27.769> or<00:02:28.769> if

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
restore previous session option or if

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.059 
restore previous session option or if
it's<00:02:30.120> something<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.660> want<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.019> do<00:02:31.230> every<00:02:31.799> time

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
it's something you want to do every time

in<00:02:32.580> which<00:02:32.849> case<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.480> would<00:02:34.110> set<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.860> when

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
in which case I would set the when

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.340 
in which case I would set the when
Firefox<00:02:35.670> starts<00:02:36.140> option<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.560> preferences

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.040 

and<00:02:40.440> one<00:02:41.400> thing<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.640> Firefox<00:02:42.330> also<00:02:42.810> does

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and one thing that Firefox also does

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.330 
and one thing that Firefox also does
that's<00:02:43.350> really<00:02:43.650> cool<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:46.650> only<00:02:46.920> does<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
that's really cool is not only does it

remember<00:02:47.820> what<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> tabs<00:02:49.520> but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
remember what was in all the tabs but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.510

you'll<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.030> also<00:02:51.180> remembers<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.990> history

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
you'll see it also remembers the history

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.610 
you'll see it also remembers the history
within<00:02:53.520> each<00:02:53.670> tab<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.870> go<00:02:55.110> forward

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
within each tab so you can go forward

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
something that Safari doesn't do so it's

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.830 
something that Safari doesn't do so it's
really<00:03:03.900> cool<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.840> recapture
