discreetly into a single point one can

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.429 
discreetly into a single point one can

another big advantage to al fara is the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.130 
another big advantage to al fara is the
fact<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.670> you<00:05:05.820> can<00:05:06.000> directly<00:05:06.360> visualize<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
the forehead and we can very easily see

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.050
