well<00:01:13.850> connect<00:01:14.600> was<00:01:14.960> amazing<00:01:15.400> because<00:01:16.400> all<00:01:16.700> of

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
well connect was amazing because all of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.280 
well connect was amazing because all of
a<00:01:16.790> sudden<00:01:17.119> there<00:01:17.420> was<00:01:17.509> an<00:01:17.630> entire<00:01:18.020> new

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
a sudden there was an entire new

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.920 
a sudden there was an entire new
ballpark<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.220> go<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.970> make<00:01:20.150> mistakes<00:01:20.300> and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
ballpark to go to and make mistakes and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.760 
ballpark to go to and make mistakes and
try<00:01:21.110> new<00:01:21.170> things

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
try new things

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.890 
try new things
experiment<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.550> what<00:01:23.420> you're<00:01:23.540> gonna<00:01:23.630> see<00:01:23.840> is

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
experiment and what you're gonna see is

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.180 
experiment and what you're gonna see is
a<00:01:23.960> little<00:01:24.200> bit<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.500> what<00:01:24.680> we<00:01:24.800> found

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
a little bit of what we found

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.670 
a little bit of what we found
we've<00:01:25.880> got<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> lot<00:01:26.300> more<00:01:26.330> demos<00:01:26.869> as<00:01:27.020> well<00:01:27.229> and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
we've got a lot more demos as well and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.499 
we've got a lot more demos as well and
we<00:01:27.830> didn't<00:01:28.100> bring<00:01:28.250> these<00:01:29.000> are<00:01:29.150> two<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:29.479> just

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
we didn't bring these are two that just

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.139 
we didn't bring these are two that just
kind<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:29.900> illustrate<00:01:33.490> yeah<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.729> think<00:01:34.850> Dan

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
kind of illustrate yeah I think Dan

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.880 
kind of illustrate yeah I think Dan
showed<00:01:35.390> some<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.750> off<00:01:35.930> some<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.410> resume

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
showed some of that off some the resume

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.340 
showed some of that off some the resume
and<00:01:37.070> stuff<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:37.550> again<00:01:38.000> connect<00:01:38.690> it's<00:01:39.050> picking

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
and stuff so again connect it's picking

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.630 
and stuff so again connect it's picking
up<00:01:39.440> all<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> subtle<00:01:40.009> movements<00:01:40.369> of<00:01:40.520> you

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
up all the subtle movements of you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.109 
up all the subtle movements of you
including<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:42.190> distance<00:01:43.190> from<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.550> as<00:01:43.729> well

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
including the distance from it as well

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.060 
including the distance from it as well
so<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:44.960> know<00:01:45.080> we'll<00:01:45.470> show<00:01:45.649> off<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.830> lot<00:01:46.039> more

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
so you know we'll show off a lot more

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.680 
so you know we'll show off a lot more
that<00:01:46.460> when<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:46.759> get<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.060> car<00:01:47.240> experience

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
that when we get to the car experience

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.880 
that when we get to the car experience
but<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.050> know<00:01:48.140> even<00:01:48.440> in<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.560> driving

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
but you know even in the driving

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.620 
but you know even in the driving
experience<00:01:48.979> kind<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.060> give<00:01:50.240> me<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:50.509> it's

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
experience kind of give me what it's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.940 
experience kind of give me what it's
like<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.869> actually<00:01:50.930> be<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.380> cockpit<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.860> be

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
like to actually be in a cockpit and be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.550 
like to actually be in a cockpit and be
able<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.130> look<00:01:52.250> around<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.700> tour

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.289 

do<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.190> have<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.400> concept<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:00.970> judge<00:02:01.119> with

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
do we have a concept to judge with

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.000 
do we have a concept to judge with
difficulty<00:02:01.750> levels<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.320> think<00:02:02.890> that's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
difficulty levels I think that's

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.590 
difficulty levels I think that's
something<00:02:03.220> we<00:02:03.369> always<00:02:03.850> want<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.150> try<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.390> do<00:02:04.570> I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
something we always want to try to do I

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600 
something we always want to try to do I
mean<00:02:04.900> if<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.170> look<00:02:05.320> at<00:02:05.470> our<00:02:05.740> career<00:02:06.070> system<00:02:06.460> in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
mean if you look at our career system in

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.760 
mean if you look at our career system in
-<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:07.060> sorts<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.390> 3<00:02:07.630> right<00:02:07.869> we<00:02:08.080> we<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.649> all

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
- in sorts of 3 right we we have all

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.680 
- in sorts of 3 right we we have all
different<00:02:09.100> types<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.610> scalars<00:02:10.119> right<00:02:10.479> if<00:02:10.600> you

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
different types of scalars right if you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.270 
different types of scalars right if you
turn<00:02:10.840> assists<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.410> if<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:11.770> turn<00:02:11.950> them<00:02:12.069> off

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
turn assists on if you turn them off

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.720 
turn assists on if you turn them off
it's<00:02:12.550> more<00:02:12.700> difficult<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:14.319> this<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.830> no<00:02:15.400> we

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
it's more difficult in this one no we

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.640 
it's more difficult in this one no we
really<00:02:16.150> wanted<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:17.020> nail<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.500> at

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
really wanted you just to nail that at

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.500 
really wanted you just to nail that at
that<00:02:17.830> immersive<00:02:18.190> experience<00:02:18.610> right<00:02:18.790> away<00:02:18.819> but

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that immersive experience right away but

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.920 
that immersive experience right away but
it's<00:02:19.660> something<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.530> we've<00:02:20.890> always<00:02:21.100> done

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
it's something that we've always done

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.020 
it's something that we've always done
it's<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.110> easy<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.950> I've<00:02:27.610> got<00:02:27.790> full

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
it's so easy but here I've got full

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's so easy but here I've got full
range<00:02:28.270> again<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.870> walk<00:02:29.050> up<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.470> car<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
range again I can walk up to the car and

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.330 
range again I can walk up to the car and
walk<00:02:30.160> back<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:31.120> can<00:02:31.660> go<00:02:31.810> around<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.200> car<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.860> can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
walk back I can go around the car I can

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.400 
walk back I can go around the car I can
lean<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.580> go<00:02:33.880> faster<00:02:34.390> though<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.750> entire<00:02:35.050> car

finer details I can lean to kind of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.340 
finer details I can lean to kind of
scope<00:02:48.459> out<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> parts<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.209> car<00:02:49.420> again

scope out the parts of the car again
once<00:02:50.830> we<00:02:50.950> got<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:51.250> basic<00:02:51.720> functionality<00:02:52.720> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
once we got this basic functionality and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.690 
once we got this basic functionality and
it<00:02:52.900> was<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.290> exciting<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.800> us<00:02:54.069> right<00:02:54.340> it's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
it was just so exciting to us right it's

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.400 
it was just so exciting to us right it's
like<00:02:54.790> wow<00:02:55.330> all<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> sudden<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.260> know<00:02:56.380> I

like wow all of a sudden you know I
don't<00:02:56.650> have<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:57.010> let<00:02:57.489> me<00:02:57.670> trigger<00:02:58.090> all<00:02:58.209> these

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
don't have to let me trigger all these

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.820 
don't have to let me trigger all these
parts<00:02:58.630> I'm<00:02:58.720> actually<00:02:58.870> being<00:02:59.200> able<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> walk<00:02:59.590> up

parts I'm actually being able to walk up

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.160 
parts I'm actually being able to walk up
and<00:03:00.130> see<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.640> things<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.030> won't<00:03:01.239> see<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
and see the things that I won't see the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.259 
and see the things that I won't see the
biggest<00:03:02.319> analogy<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.950> be<00:03:02.980> drawn<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.760> we<00:03:04.090> took

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
biggest analogy to be drawn that we took

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.729 
biggest analogy to be drawn that we took
to<00:03:04.390> heart<00:03:04.510> as<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> team<00:03:04.989> was<00:03:05.230> thinking<00:03:05.650> about

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
to heart as a team was thinking about

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.190 
to heart as a team was thinking about
each<00:03:06.070> cars<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.549> zone<00:03:06.700> level<00:03:07.030> when<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.959> use

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
each cars in zone level when you use

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.170 
each cars in zone level when you use
sort<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:08.890> thing<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.220> car<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.610> power<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:09.970> 10

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
sort of thing of the car the power of 10

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.789 
sort of thing of the car the power of 10
that<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.540> going<00:03:10.720> down<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> level<00:03:11.440> down<00:03:11.769> a

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
that if you're going down a level down a

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.880 
that if you're going down a level down a
level<00:03:12.130> down<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.310> level

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
level down a level

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.470 
level down a level
when<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.790> level<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.090> detail

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
when you get to the level of detail

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.540 
when you get to the level of detail
we're<00:03:14.690> capturing<00:03:14.990> here<00:03:15.500> every<00:03:16.100> car<00:03:16.370> is

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
we're capturing here every car is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.160 
we're capturing here every car is
completely<00:03:17.150> unique<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.720> mean<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.900> difference

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
completely unique I mean the difference

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.780 
completely unique I mean the difference
between<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.410> 325<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.490> 335<00:03:21.550> it's<00:03:22.550> very

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
between a 325 and a 335 it's very

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.460 
between a 325 and a 335 it's very
different<00:03:23.209> even<00:03:23.330> at<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.600> level<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.140> when<00:03:24.410> you

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
different even at this level so when you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.750 
different even at this level so when you
look<00:03:24.620> at<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.770> diversity<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.220> Ferrari<00:03:25.550> and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
look at the diversity of Ferrari and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.350 
look at the diversity of Ferrari and
Lamborghini

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
Lamborghini

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.630 
Lamborghini
it's<00:03:26.690> huge<00:03:27.140> difference<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.160> we<00:03:28.280> wanted<00:03:28.520> the

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
it's huge difference and we wanted the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.790 
it's huge difference and we wanted the
player<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.120> be<00:03:29.240> able<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.510> explore<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.350> car<00:03:30.560> and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
player to be able to explore the car and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.430 
player to be able to explore the car and
find<00:03:31.010> kind<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.580> interesting<00:03:32.110> tidbits<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
find kind of interesting tidbits and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.750 
find kind of interesting tidbits and
delight<00:03:33.770> around<00:03:34.070> every<00:03:34.310> corner<00:03:34.490> where

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
delight around every corner where

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.610 
delight around every corner where
they're<00:03:34.880> like<00:03:35.000> oh<00:03:35.150> oh<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.870> know<00:03:35.990> so<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.500> more

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
they're like oh oh you know so it's more

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.979 
they're like oh oh you know so it's more
like<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.830> powerup<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.240> crackdown<00:03:38.810> that

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
analogy used like the movie big times in

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.370 
analogy used like the movie big times in
the<00:04:23.130> limo

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
the limo

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.630 
the limo
he's<00:04:25.380> pretty<00:04:25.530> excited<00:04:25.740> about<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.370> first

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
he's pretty excited about this first

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.040 
he's pretty excited about this first
time<00:04:26.790> in<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.090> thing<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.540> wanted<00:04:27.840> people<00:04:27.870> to

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
time in this thing we wanted people to

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:39.790 
time in this thing we wanted people to
have<00:04:28.170> that<00:04:28.230> same<00:04:28.380> experience

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
so clicking like the outside I've got

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.800 
so clicking like the outside I've got
full<00:04:42.740> control<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:43.699> can<00:04:44.090> actually<00:04:44.240> kind<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.599> look

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
full control I can actually kind of look

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.050 
full control I can actually kind of look
in<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.440> can<00:04:45.830> check<00:04:46.039> out<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.310> center<00:04:46.580> console

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
in I can check out the center console

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.100 
in I can check out the center console
the<00:04:47.539> -<00:04:47.750> check<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.650> manettino<00:04:49.039> dial

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
the - check that the manettino dial

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.809 
the - check that the manettino dial
again<00:04:50.680> it's<00:04:50.860> all<00:04:51.069> these<00:04:51.220> little<00:04:51.370> intricacies

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
again it's all these little intricacies

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.089 
again it's all these little intricacies
that<00:04:52.240> probably<00:04:52.690> would<00:04:52.870> normally<00:04:53.710> no<00:04:53.860> it's

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
that probably would normally no it's

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.499 
that probably would normally no it's
right<00:04:54.340> even<00:04:54.580> now<00:04:54.699> kind<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.060> just<00:04:55.210> sit<00:04:55.419> and

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
right even now kind of just sit and

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.740 
right even now kind of just sit and
dissect<00:04:55.990> like<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.650> could<00:04:56.830> have<00:04:57.039> you<00:04:57.129> been

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750
