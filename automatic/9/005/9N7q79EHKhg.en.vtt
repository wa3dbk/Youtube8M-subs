that we get about iron wills home life

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920 
that we get about iron wills home life
is<00:01:38.130> only<00:01:38.430> given<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> us<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> last<00:01:39.600> third

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
is only given to us in the last third

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.710 
is only given to us in the last third
and<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.250> getting<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> end

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and it's not that getting it at the end

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
and it's not that getting it at the end
was<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> problem<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> fact<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
was the problem it was the fact that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
was the problem it was the fact that
everything<00:01:45.240> leading<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.710> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
everything leading up to it was just so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
everything leading up to it was just so
underwhelming<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.090> would<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.329> been<00:01:48.450> nicer

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
underwhelming it would have been nicer

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
underwhelming it would have been nicer
if<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:48.930> had<00:01:49.140> gotten<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.770> iron<00:01:50.009> will<00:01:50.340> going

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
if we had gotten to see iron will going

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.249 
if we had gotten to see iron will going
through<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> an<00:01:51.390> inner<00:01:51.540> struggle<00:01:51.990> where

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
through kind of an inner struggle where

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
through kind of an inner struggle where
he's<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.590> man<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.210> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
he's like man I really got to do this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.209 
he's like man I really got to do this
because<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.290> tell<00:01:55.500> her<00:01:55.560> he<00:01:55.710> loves<00:01:56.009> his

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
because you can tell her he loves his

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
because you can tell her he loves his
son<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.299> saw<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.229> inner

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
son so if we saw more of that inner

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350 
son so if we saw more of that inner
struggle<00:01:58.979> where<00:01:59.219> he<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.790> wants<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.149> do

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
struggle where he really wants to do

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
struggle where he really wants to do
this<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> sake<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> his<00:02:01.380> child<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.009> would

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this for the sake of his child it would

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.770 
this for the sake of his child it would
have<00:02:02.280> given<00:02:02.430> more<00:02:02.729> impact<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.390> scene

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
have given more impact to that scene

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.149 
have given more impact to that scene
where<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.170> finally<00:02:04.619> find<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:05.009> his

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
where we finally find out his

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.560 
where we finally find out his
motivations<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:05.969> wanting<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.329> better

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
motivations for wanting to better

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.900 
motivations for wanting to better
himself<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:07.770> thought<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.610> iron

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
himself I also thought that the way iron

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.910 
himself I also thought that the way iron
will<00:02:09.209> explained<00:02:09.810> his<00:02:09.989> motivations<00:02:10.649> could

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
will explained his motivations could

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.410 
will explained his motivations could
have<00:02:11.039> been<00:02:11.190> better<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.910> way<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.209> scene

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
have been better the way the scene

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.699 
have been better the way the scene
starts<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.110> great

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
starts out is great

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.860 
starts out is great
iron<00:02:14.069> will<00:02:14.189> has<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> final<00:02:14.819> outburst<00:02:15.359> and<00:02:15.629> runs

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
iron will has a final outburst and runs

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.539 
iron will has a final outburst and runs
off<00:02:16.049> into<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.349> everfree<00:02:16.680> forest<00:02:16.799> thinking

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
off into the everfree forest thinking

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.099 
off into the everfree forest thinking
that<00:02:17.700> there's<00:02:17.879> no<00:02:18.060> way<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.269> him<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.629> become<00:02:18.900> a

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
that there's no way for him to become a

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.020 
that there's no way for him to become a
nicer<00:02:19.560> Minotaur<00:02:20.099> Fluttershy<00:02:20.670> goes<00:02:20.879> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
nicer Minotaur Fluttershy goes to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.209 
nicer Minotaur Fluttershy goes to
comfort<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.540> man<00:02:21.659> asks<00:02:22.049> why<00:02:22.290> his<00:02:22.590> wife<00:02:22.859> kicked

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
comfort and man asks why his wife kicked

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.039 
comfort and man asks why his wife kicked
him<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.579> house<00:02:23.790> specifically<00:02:24.599> but

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
him out of the house specifically but

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.809 
him out of the house specifically but
then<00:02:25.230> what<00:02:25.409> follows<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.219> info-dump

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
then what follows is just the info-dump

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.819 
then what follows is just the info-dump
from<00:02:27.060> iron<00:02:27.269> will<00:02:27.599> what<00:02:28.079> would<00:02:28.319> have<00:02:28.439> been<00:02:28.560> nice

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
from iron will what would have been nice

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.949 
from iron will what would have been nice
is<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.549> some<00:02:29.730> imagery<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:30.599> along

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
is if we had some imagery to go along

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.899 
is if we had some imagery to go along
with<00:02:30.989> his<00:02:31.260> explanation<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:32.459> way<00:02:32.609> we<00:02:32.760> could

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
with his explanation that way we could

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.910 
with his explanation that way we could
have<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> visualization<00:02:33.689> of<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.530> problem<00:02:34.889> that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
have a visualization of the problem that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.099 
have a visualization of the problem that
he's<00:02:35.129> facing<00:02:35.549> at<00:02:35.670> home<00:02:35.879> witness<00:02:36.480> information

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
he's facing at home witness information

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.410 
he's facing at home witness information
and<00:02:37.290> mine<00:02:37.469> once<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.980> reread<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.670> issue<00:02:38.849> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
and mine once you reread the issue it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
and mine once you reread the issue it
gives<00:02:39.659> his<00:02:39.840> actions<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.349> lot<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.799> weight<00:02:41.099> but

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
gives his actions a lot more weight but

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.800 
gives his actions a lot more weight but
it<00:02:41.609> would<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.879> been<00:02:42.030> nice<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.299> see<00:02:42.599> some

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it would have been nice to see some

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
it would have been nice to see some
hints<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:44.219> it<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.549> possible<00:02:44.819> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
hints of this because it is possible to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.970 
hints of this because it is possible to
hint<00:02:45.480> at<00:02:45.659> it<00:02:45.689> without<00:02:46.079> making<00:02:46.439> it<00:02:46.500> obvious

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
hint at it without making it obvious

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.890 
hint at it without making it obvious
as<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.370> comic<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.879> now<00:02:48.090> though<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.659> final

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
as the comic is now though the final

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.360 
as the comic is now though the final
scene<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.439> enough<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.859> pull<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.220> issue

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
scene was enough to pull the issue

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.800 
scene was enough to pull the issue
through<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.000> make<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.299> one<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.689> was

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
through and make it one that was

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.899 
through and make it one that was
enjoyable<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> recommend<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.669> folks

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
enjoyable so I recommend it to folks

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.640 
enjoyable so I recommend it to folks
that<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.269> family<00:02:54.689> centered<00:02:55.049> stories<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
that like family centered stories and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.129 
that like family centered stories and
the<00:02:56.129> people<00:02:56.430> who<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.970> when<00:02:57.120> MLP<00:02:57.540> tackles

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
the people who like it when MLP tackles

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.750 
the people who like it when MLP tackles
some<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.560> difficult<00:02:58.980> issues<00:02:59.340> because

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
some really difficult issues because

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.209 
some really difficult issues because
this<00:02:59.969> was<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.389> biggie<00:03:00.870> interesting<00:03:01.829> tidbit

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
this was a biggie interesting tidbit

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.280 
this was a biggie interesting tidbit
though<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.669> this<00:03:03.269> issue<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.780> get<00:03:03.930> our<00:03:04.049> first

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
though in this issue we get our first
