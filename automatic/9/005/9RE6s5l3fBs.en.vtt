00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.770 
whatever color you like and I recommend
using<00:02:03.930> at<00:02:04.170> least<00:02:04.409> three<00:02:04.979> bands<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
using at least three bands for this and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540 
using at least three bands for this and
you<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.560> don't<00:02:07.740> need<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.009> many<00:02:08.250> bands

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you really don't need that many bands

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.380 
you really don't need that many bands
and<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> really<00:02:09.959> simple<00:02:10.110> craft<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and this is a really simple craft and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.950 
and this is a really simple craft and
this<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.380> my<00:02:12.590> original<00:02:12.850> sort<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.940> technique<00:02:14.330> so

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
this is my original sort of technique so

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.199 
this is my original sort of technique so
you're<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> take<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:15.770> bag<00:02:16.209> and

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
you're going to take your little bag and

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.170 
you're going to take your little bag and
you're<00:02:17.990> going<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.140> open<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.500> up<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.180> then

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you're going to open it up and then

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.920 
you're going to open it up and then
you're<00:02:20.300> going<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> take<00:02:20.720> your<00:02:20.900> charm<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.930> put

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
you're going to take your charm and put

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.150 
you're going to take your charm and put
it<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:26.959> use<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:27.500> technique<00:02:27.920> for

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
it in and you can use this technique for

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.260 
it in and you can use this technique for
like<00:02:28.610> ribbon<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.750> tie<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:32.090> used
