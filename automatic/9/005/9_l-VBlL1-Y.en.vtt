00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.770

 make the best of it is really 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.649

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 Try a small cupcake 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.020

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.290
 in the living room 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.330
 but it does not hurt that much 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 to bring in a bit of flair to match 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.060
 I then have this opponent so runner 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.220

 A purple cupcake and city ​​here is one 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.000
 there is not even the smell it the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.019
 is a turquoise cupcake and not 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.109
 pleasant and the most pleasant book of 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.190
 all is the vanilla cupcake with pink 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.410
 and turquoise 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.620
 but there is not much candle in it 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.840
 but they are just as good at it 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.190
 do me in the apartment and now 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.400
 already with the boring came the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.500
 can be useful that are simple 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.540
 hangers here and an accessory 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.040

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.100
 You can do that very well at his door 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.290
 I could afford and have better more 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.580
 had good but would have to bike chain 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.950
 I just go to eat again 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.610
 the award makes the times sometimes even 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.750
 I still have a few things with tchibo 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.220
 but they are not there yet 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.990
 I will just be interested 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.790
 are you interested in that at all? 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.070
 Show you lifestyle things like that 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.000
 because that's not a beauty right now 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.080
 is not a fashion but me now 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.250
 maybe that would have one that so 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.530
 Just that I'm a bit older 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.760
 I will and my apartment always 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.290
 more importantly I would have one now 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.070
 whole apartment that I can decorate 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.580
 and not just my kids room in that 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.710
 senses 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.110
 but as I said I just think that 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.130
 if there is a theme that I enjoy 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.510
 I hope that to me 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.740
 That's why you can transport it 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.340
 These lifestyle themes are also a pleasure 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.050
 prepare 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.740
