 the armchair of the public prosecutor 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.810
 I go in the asset file because I 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.050
 every time I post a little message that I'm not going 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 to put 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.810
 here there are many areas this to teach 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 teach but you will have to throw a lot 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.350
 time because I do not just want to teach 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 all this 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.939
 whatever 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.939
 if you see souls 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.700
 tiqui everything was so that's a 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.700
 comfort 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.950
 normal 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.550
 I found one and here we are not going to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.120
 do nothing 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.250
 so let's go outside 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.360
 well where is the white tree 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:29.940
 without leaves until the heir arrives 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.940
 from isildur if I'm a geek and I like it 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.239
 and here that when 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.239
 the movie ends 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.870
 here where they enter live and gandalf 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:54.020
 and will move to them directly 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.600
 flying is not done all he 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.910
 the map and only the city 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.590
 if they would not need 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.530
 much we see here 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.720
 before a full return to be loaded 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.980
 the map but you do not have to load it 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.540
 through again but contemplate looking 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.540
 but fantastic epics 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.349
 in extreme it will take 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.480
 very much in charge 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.379
 so leave it directly good 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 after he called 13 hs 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.060
 minecraft out we do not try the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.060
 things 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.780
 but agree that there is a boy 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.330
 he told me that he appoint the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.819
 video uach and mingo monkey if I do not remember 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.069
 wrong 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.840
 and let's go 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.150
 being clear and sincere for the day 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.280
 nightmare that is expected to be not 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.099
 you could name it the videos that are 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.310
 loose has recorded but did not exist and there 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.800
 I have to self do not know I 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.760
 robben 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.600
 or not to the entrance of this mega and epic 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.260
 fantastic city ​​of Tirith mines here 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.049
 where they fight against the trolls of 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.910
 everything is at a height of two and looked 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.910
 before and they are at that height 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.539
 to break 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.290
 be this is a reason why an impressive 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.990
 I have seen another map because I can not 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.990
 lower the increase will go down 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.750
 I can not go down 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:48.320
 details to the fullest 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.500
 looking at images of how they did 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.800
 the one in the movie and this one is very 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.220
 similar man the measure of a bed not 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.990
 it may be the same because cubes do not 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.950
 you can do you can not do circles 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.040
 because they always come out unequal to being 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:11.630
 squares or be an awesome rollo 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.169
 but what I've done 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.139
 It is a very big and very good heart 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.560
 the city is very well made to me 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.560
 charmed 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.990
 is not here to make other war stories 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.240
 of soldiers not because they do not enter but I 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.280
 I know I 'm going to do a I think or 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.470
 soon I will make one 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.280
 so 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.110
 very cool dad wanted to treat the oven 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.810
 because I've looked for a lot more parents in the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.220
 ring that will bring a series of map and 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.010
 things of those 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.590
 everyone who likes the one who does not 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.700
 like it well because I did not tell it is 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:00.250
 that simple simple before I got 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.249
 break minecraft again with this piece 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.350
 of map 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:09.810
 say goodbye to the pimp 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:13.070
 so nothing I hope you liked me 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.620
 dismissal here on the white tree 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.730
