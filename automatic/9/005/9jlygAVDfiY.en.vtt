00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 not the first half time it was done 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.279
 put a strap on the left thigh so 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.670
 that may have been the cause of his 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.200
 replacement at half time 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.490
 Come on, let's play with this melee bayonnais 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 you pay attention the contact no 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 marvin o'connor nation tackles that says 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.160
 sir tip for now to dry up 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.090
 not here makes shake marvin o'connor on 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.029
 this action and look there he goes 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 find his place with the right arm in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.000
 great suffering it is he who will 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 try to come back on this balloon he goes 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.150
 leave earlier and it's welcome to his 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.830
 half scrum guillaume roy is the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 transmission on scott kelly that clears 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.279
 with class the defensive rise jewel 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.200
 kossoko is superb 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.390
 Rokocoko joey in its classic style 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 nonchalant enough but able on a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.360
 acceleration on a support to drop on 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.070
 the opponent and the intervention of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.170
 sir what is it all about las vegas and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 you stayed on the ground near time and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.930
 so there is the case gets work 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 for you delve into the broken side 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.140
 lyonnais and the bayonais side 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 also one since it's marvin 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.489
 o'connor 1 who is recovering from the shock 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.050
 previous on his tackle and who is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
 treated at the level of the right neck 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.149
 and worry we told you side 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.739
 Lyon side with a green player 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 who the healers and the doctor have 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.299
 quickly approached I do not know 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.619
 exactly who is on the edge of the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.189
 field and listen to them just from the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.810
 see in slow motion the superb image captured 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.100
 by our teams with this shock 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 at first actually you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 described it from 2 marvin o'connor and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.320
 then it seems to me that it is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.650
 sukanaveita who falling back and well one 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 see the foot of sukanaveita come orthez 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.299
 Stephen Brett his partner here at 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.100
 the marvin o'connor image that seems pretty 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 seriously affected in any case we have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270
 uses the stretcher 1 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.700
 for the Lyon player to see you again 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.350
 cut we send this picture tell me we 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.729
 will see again he will come to place himself on 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 outside and there he will take the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.090
 crampon in the jaw a little bit and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.520
 we see in his way of falling he 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.289
 is he's totally ko on ring on the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 shock that actually totally 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.420
 involuntary but sometimes when it's 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.890
 misplaced enough it causes 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.539
 shocks it relatively important as 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:05.049
 this one then from another angle here 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:07.939
 where he falls completely ko delicate 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.810
 yeah it's still very impressive 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:19.220
 to see a year later then if sees it 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:23.870
 Stefan tmm stephen bright second 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.599
 period that starts in the worst way 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.150
 for for stephen bright this story that 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.700
 takes in full jaw estaing this is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.500
 a hook like hung two boxers 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.060
 but with the foot looked at the shard all 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.849
 first to marvin o'connor stif 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.930
 would like who is slow to get up and who 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.290
 take her left foot from sukanaveita 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.160
 in the lower face in the jaw 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.440
 pictures that are very very 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.930
 impressive after will have to wait 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.519
 necessarily the go the care that goes 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.810
 to be that they will be procured 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.609
 Now gifts are often 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.959
 impressive it does not want to engender fear 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.310
 it does not necessarily result in 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.260
 big injuries behind all the time 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.019
 must be reassured in relation to 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.459
 images that are seen but now he 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.810
 must really take the maximum especially 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.720
 with this new concussion protocol 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.450
 brain that is set up one is 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.959
 which will obviously be applied for 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.099
 Stephen Brett is obviously wanted 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.319
 they find the ground quickly 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.599
 restifo box that spent a season 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.700
 it was last year here at 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.459
 bayonne him the New Zealander go through 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.459
 the crusaders go through the blues 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.890
 winner of a super rugby it was in 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.300
 2008 that after a stint in Japan and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.240
 decided to come and continue his career 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.800
 in top 14 and the applause 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.540
 obviously dauger jean while we go 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.490
 love the game may be we may be going 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.569
 to be able to see her dancing of course 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.150
 we watch it and that of the bayonnais 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.370
 Bayonne fronts gather around 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.280
 time their captain 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.690
 we know we talked we took advantage of 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.980
 his moments to get motivated 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.580
 while jean michel montanÃ¨s here in 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.239
 tribunes obviously worries for for 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.239
 stephen bright 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.470
 the player bayonnais fronts benefits 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.590
 certainly to refocus 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.620
 since since already the stops of game 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.879
 necessarily little annoying that two cases is 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.989
 a little bit the pace of the game but it 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.220
 can also break morale while 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.540
 just because even if that player 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.190
 does not belong to our team it's 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.070
 its awesome images that 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.720
 can who can shock a team 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.860
 like the other even shared not touch 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.050
 especially when the players know each other 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.250
 from one team to another they respect each other 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.320
 and above all they know that it can 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.320
 to arrive at any of them
