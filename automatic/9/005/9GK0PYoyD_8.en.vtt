and right here now wait I do not have a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
and right here now wait I do not have a
scale<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.909> i<00:01:53.939> can't<00:01:54.270> tell<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.869> certainty

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
scale so i can't tell you with certainty

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.350 
scale so i can't tell you with certainty
how<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.770> these<00:01:55.950> cases<00:01:56.399> way<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.880> i<00:01:56.909> will<00:01:57.149> say

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
how much these cases way but i will say

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
how much these cases way but i will say
this<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.140> marware<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.460> feather

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
this the marware is just a feather

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
this the marware is just a feather
lighter<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:00.930> opinion<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.130> by

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
lighter in my opinion and that's just by

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.090 
lighter in my opinion and that's just by
picking<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> feeling<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.320> then

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
picking it up and feeling it and then

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
picking it up and feeling it and then
holding<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> switch<00:02:05.909> easy<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.360> feeling<00:02:06.719> that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
holding the switch easy and feeling that

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.109 
holding the switch easy and feeling that
as<00:02:07.020> well<00:02:07.290> yes<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> switch<00:02:08.489> easy<00:02:08.729> feels

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
as well yes the switch easy feels

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.020 
as well yes the switch easy feels
heavier<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:10.349> by<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> ton<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.640> don't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
heavier but not by a ton so I don't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.370 
heavier but not by a ton so I don't
think<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> enough

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
think that that is enough

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.680 
think that that is enough
sway<00:02:13.620> your<00:02:13.800> decision<00:02:13.880> now<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.090> take<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.420> look

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
sway your decision now if we take a look

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.020 
sway your decision now if we take a look
at<00:02:15.960> how<00:02:16.230> everything<00:02:16.860> compares<00:02:17.520> let<00:02:17.880> me<00:02:17.940> go

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
at how everything compares let me go

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.520 
at how everything compares let me go
ahead<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.210> show<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
ahead and show you because the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.350 
ahead and show you because the
switcheasy<00:02:19.950> will<00:02:20.340> provide<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.880> little<00:02:21.240> bit

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
switcheasy will provide a little bit

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.090 
switcheasy will provide a little bit
more<00:02:21.540> protection<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.740> look<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
more protection if you look on the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.890 
more protection if you look on the
bottom<00:02:23.220> side<00:02:23.610> here<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.210> see<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> marware

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
bottom side here you can see the marware

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.260 
bottom side here you can see the marware
is<00:02:25.080> up<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.530> top<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.880> areas<00:02:27.240> that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
is up on top you can see the areas that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.840 
is up on top you can see the areas that
are<00:02:27.540> exposed<00:02:27.930> versus<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.680> switch<00:02:28.920> easy<00:02:29.160> we

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
are exposed versus the switch easy we

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.820 
are exposed versus the switch easy we
move<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> along<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> side<00:02:31.020> where<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
move it along to the side where the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.970 
move it along to the side where the
clasp<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.780> pretty<00:02:33.780> much<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.110> same<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.560> then

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
clasp is pretty much the same and then

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.700 
clasp is pretty much the same and then
if<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.190> go<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> top<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.510> see<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
if we go to the top you can see that the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.250 
if we go to the top you can see that the
marware<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.340> top<00:02:38.610> exposes<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:39.930> bit<00:02:40.050> more

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
marware on top exposes a little bit more

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.710 
marware on top exposes a little bit more
and<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.550> move<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.850> back<00:02:42.090> side<00:02:42.360> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
and then if we move to the back side and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960 
and then if we move to the back side and
I'll<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.430> other<00:02:44.670> side

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
I'll just do this because the other side

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
I'll just do this because the other side
is<00:02:45.210> covered<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.740> what<00:02:46.890> this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
is covered up you can see what this

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040 
is covered up you can see what this
looks<00:02:47.100> like<00:02:47.400> pretty<00:02:48.090> similar<00:02:48.540> except<00:02:48.870> for

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
looks like pretty similar except for

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.200 
looks like pretty similar except for
that<00:02:49.140> top<00:02:49.440> area<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> marware<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.120> is

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
that top area on the marware so that is

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.420 
that top area on the marware so that is
how<00:02:51.360> everything<00:02:51.840> lines<00:02:52.320> up<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.860> then<00:02:53.250> also

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
how everything lines up and then also

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.820 
how everything lines up and then also
down<00:02:53.790> here<00:02:54.050> you've<00:02:55.050> got<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> bit<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.560> speaker

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
down here you've got a bit of a speaker

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.460 
down here you've got a bit of a speaker
grill<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.490> marware<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.330> again<00:02:58.290> that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
grill on the marware and again that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.350 
grill on the marware and again that
polycarbonate<00:02:59.250> shell<00:02:59.490> does<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> good<00:02:59.940> job<00:03:00.000> on

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
polycarbonate shell does a good job on

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.910 
polycarbonate shell does a good job on
the<00:03:00.480> switcheasy<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.140> really<00:03:01.590> keeping

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the switcheasy of really keeping

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.790 
the switcheasy of really keeping
everything<00:03:02.220> protected<00:03:03.320> thickness<00:03:04.320> wise<00:03:04.530> if

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
everything protected thickness wise if

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.230 
everything protected thickness wise if
you<00:03:04.830> take<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> look<00:03:05.310> at<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.760> switch<00:03:06.000> easy

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
you take a look at this the switch easy

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.330 
you take a look at this the switch easy
on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> left<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> marware<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> right<00:03:07.770> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
on the left the marware on the right the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.550 
on the left the marware on the right the
marware<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.970> thinner<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.140> looked<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.500> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
marware is thinner if you looked at that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.320 
marware is thinner if you looked at that
switch<00:03:11.010> easy<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.550> took<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.790> bottom

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
switch easy and you took that bottom

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.090 
switch easy and you took that bottom
canvas<00:03:12.810> piece<00:03:13.080> off<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.590> only<00:03:13.800> had<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
canvas piece off and only had the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.800 
canvas piece off and only had the
polycarbonate<00:03:14.970> shell<00:03:15.240> it'd<00:03:15.450> probably<00:03:15.660> be

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
polycarbonate shell it'd probably be

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.590 
polycarbonate shell it'd probably be
about<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.260> same<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:17.160> as<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.400> stands<00:03:17.700> here<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
about the same but as it stands here the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.720 
about the same but as it stands here the
marware<00:03:18.960> is<00:03:19.170> definitely<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.580> be<00:03:20.700> a

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
marware is definitely going to be a

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.930 
marware is definitely going to be a
little<00:03:21.210> bit<00:03:21.390> lower<00:03:22.200> profile<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:23.580> open<00:03:23.850> these

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
little bit lower profile to open these

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.750 
little bit lower profile to open these
cases<00:03:24.390> up<00:03:24.540> switcheasy<00:03:25.500> uses<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:26.010> clasp<00:03:26.370> they

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
cases up switcheasy uses that clasp they

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.730 
cases up switcheasy uses that clasp they
both<00:03:26.940> incorporate<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> sleep/wake<00:03:28.230> there's

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
both incorporate the sleep/wake there's

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.560

that in mind you get a couple of
different<00:04:09.510> stand<00:04:09.750> positions<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.560> obviously

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
different stand positions here obviously

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.670 
different stand positions here obviously
this<00:04:11.340> one<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:12.780> also<00:04:12.900> get<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.350> stand

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
this one you also get that stand

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.250 
this one you also get that stand
position<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:14.700> finally<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.630> last<00:04:15.690> one

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
position and then finally this last one

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.410 
position and then finally this last one
it<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.650> rather<00:04:16.859> bouncy<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.820> typing<00:04:18.239> mode

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
it is rather bouncy in a typing mode

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.810 
it is rather bouncy in a typing mode
there<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.109> others<00:04:19.440> are<00:04:19.650> not<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:19.950> bad<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.640> it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
there the others are not so bad and it

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.510 
there the others are not so bad and it
stays<00:04:21.150> pretty<00:04:21.570> much<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:22.020> place<00:04:22.260> because<00:04:22.590> of

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
stays pretty much in place because of

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.660 
stays pretty much in place because of
those<00:04:24.210> deep<00:04:24.479> grooves<00:04:24.870> now<00:04:25.440> if<00:04:25.560> you've<00:04:25.710> full

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
are as follows it uses a velcro mode

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.720 
are as follows it uses a velcro mode
right<00:04:55.170> here<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:55.980> can<00:04:56.160> see<00:04:56.430> on<00:04:56.580> either

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
right here that you can see on either

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.000 
right here that you can see on either
side<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.480> do<00:04:57.690> not<00:04:57.810> get<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.260> back<00:04:58.440> exposed

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
side but you do not get the back exposed

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.710 
side but you do not get the back exposed
because<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.520> using<00:04:59.730> that<00:04:59.940> polycarbonate

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
because it's using that polycarbonate

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.600 
because it's using that polycarbonate
shell<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.800> have<00:05:01.920> a<00:05:01.950> couple<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.280> different

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
shell and you have a couple of different

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.730 
shell and you have a couple of different
typing<00:05:02.970> angles<00:05:03.270> with<00:05:03.390> this<00:05:03.570> one<00:05:03.780> as<00:05:03.900> well<00:05:04.170> so

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
typing angles with this one as well so

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.340 
typing angles with this one as well so
you<00:05:04.800> can<00:05:05.010> actually<00:05:05.160> move<00:05:05.550> into<00:05:05.850> this<00:05:05.970> mode

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
you can actually move into this mode

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.530 
you can actually move into this mode
this<00:05:07.350> mode<00:05:07.650> or<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.790> mode<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.180> can't<00:05:09.360> really

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
this mode or this mode you can't really

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.270 
this mode or this mode you can't really
go<00:05:09.630> much<00:05:09.840> further<00:05:10.020> than<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.560> as<00:05:10.770> far<00:05:11.250> as

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
go much further than that as far as

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.460 
go much further than that as far as
typing<00:05:11.850> goes<00:05:12.090> you<00:05:12.360> can<00:05:12.540> switch<00:05:12.990> this<00:05:13.290> around

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
typing goes you can switch this around

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.280 
typing goes you can switch this around
and<00:05:14.010> do<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:15.240> like<00:05:15.390> this<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.170> very

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
and do it just like this and it is very

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.770 
and do it just like this and it is very
sturdy<00:05:16.890> in<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.250> mode<00:05:17.490> or<00:05:17.970> if<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.450> don't<00:05:18.600> want

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
sturdy in that mode or if you don't want

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.540 
sturdy in that mode or if you don't want
that<00:05:18.930> touching<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.950> can<00:05:20.160> kind<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.430> do

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
that touching you can kind of do

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.510 
that touching you can kind of do
something<00:05:20.940> like<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:21.530> so<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.650> inside<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.340> not

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
something like this so the inside is not

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.950 
something like this so the inside is not
touching<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.120> now<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.270> have<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.450> typing<00:05:24.810> angle

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
touching and now you have a typing angle

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.840 
touching and now you have a typing angle
like<00:05:25.200> this<00:05:25.230> and<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.830> also<00:05:26.280> is<00:05:26.430> not<00:05:26.610> too

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
like this and that also is not too

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.960 
like this and that also is not too
springy<00:05:27.210> as<00:05:28.140> far<00:05:28.320> as<00:05:28.350> camera<00:05:28.800> goes<00:05:29.040> because

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
springy as far as camera goes because

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.550 
springy as far as camera goes because
you<00:05:30.150> can<00:05:30.180> fold<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.170> can<00:05:31.350> now<00:05:31.500> take

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
you can fold that you can now take

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.940 
you can fold that you can now take
photos<00:05:32.220> without<00:05:32.490> really<00:05:33.390> having<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:34.020> hold

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
photos without really having to hold

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.060 
photos without really having to hold
that<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.880> know<00:05:36.230> front<00:05:37.230> cover<00:05:37.470> out<00:05:37.680> like<00:05:37.860> this

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
that you know front cover out like this

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.920 
that you know front cover out like this
so<00:05:38.730> at<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:38.940> end<00:05:38.970> of<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.270> day<00:05:39.390> what<00:05:39.600> is<00:05:39.720> right

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
so at the end of the day what is right

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.050 
so at the end of the day what is right
for<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.470> marware<00:05:40.890> CEO<00:05:41.340> hybrid<00:05:41.820> or<00:05:41.970> the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
for you the marware CEO hybrid or the

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.390 
for you the marware CEO hybrid or the
switch<00:05:42.270> easy<00:05:42.480> canvas<00:05:43.130> really<00:05:44.130> that's<00:05:44.310> a

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
switch easy canvas really that's a

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.260 
switch easy canvas really that's a
question<00:05:44.550> you're<00:05:44.820> going<00:05:44.940> to<00:05:45.000> have<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.150> ask

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
question you're going to have to ask

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.880 
question you're going to have to ask
yourself<00:05:45.480> because<00:05:46.080> I'm<00:05:46.230> still<00:05:46.530> struggling

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
yourself because I'm still struggling

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.520 
yourself because I'm still struggling
with<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.370> myself<00:05:47.550> too<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.270> really<00:05:49.110> like<00:05:49.320> the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
with it myself too I really like the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.710 
with it myself too I really like the
aspect<00:05:50.190> of<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.550> additional<00:05:51.000> protection<00:05:51.600> that

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
aspect of the additional protection that

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.290 
aspect of the additional protection that
you<00:05:51.810> get<00:05:51.990> with<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.260> switch<00:05:52.500> easy<00:05:52.940> these<00:05:53.940> areas

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
you get with the switch easy these areas

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.240 
you get with the switch easy these areas
on<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.510> marware<00:05:54.870> are<00:05:55.110> exposed<00:05:55.650> but<00:05:55.920> I<00:05:55.950> found

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
on the marware are exposed but I found

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.890 
on the marware are exposed but I found
that<00:05:56.460> it<00:05:56.580> really<00:05:56.820> isn't<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.240> big<00:05:57.510> of<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.690> deal

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
that it really isn't that big of a deal

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.500 
that it really isn't that big of a deal
if<00:05:58.110> I'm<00:05:58.260> using<00:05:58.470> it<00:05:58.770> around<00:05:58.980> my<00:05:59.160> household<00:05:59.700> if<00:05:59.970> I

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
if I'm using it around my household if I

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.120 
if I'm using it around my household if I
plan<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.810> travel<00:06:01.230> I'll<00:06:01.560> probably<00:06:01.770> want<00:06:02.010> to

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
plan to travel I'll probably want to

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.890 
plan to travel I'll probably want to
throw<00:06:02.340> it<00:06:02.490> on<00:06:02.550> something<00:06:03.000> like<00:06:03.120> this<00:06:03.180> just<00:06:03.420> so

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
throw it on something like this just so

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.800 
throw it on something like this just so
that<00:06:04.080> there's<00:06:04.290> less<00:06:04.350> exposed<00:06:05.130> areas<00:06:05.810> but

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
that there's less exposed areas but

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.660 
that there's less exposed areas but
aside<00:06:07.080> from<00:06:07.140> that<00:06:07.380> you<00:06:07.770> cannot<00:06:08.190> go<00:06:08.430> wrong<00:06:08.610> with

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
aside from that you cannot go wrong with

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910 
aside from that you cannot go wrong with
either<00:06:08.880> one<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.360> these<00:06:09.630> cases<00:06:09.930> they<00:06:10.710> have<00:06:10.740> a

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
either one of these cases they have a

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.060 
either one of these cases they have a
lot<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.310> functionality<00:06:12.260> they<00:06:13.260> are<00:06:13.650> very

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
lot of functionality they are very

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.220 
lot of functionality they are very
similar<00:06:14.400> in<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.790> weight<00:06:14.970> area<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.780> marware

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
similar in the weight area the marware

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.530 
similar in the weight area the marware
is<00:06:16.380> a<00:06:16.410> little<00:06:16.800> bit<00:06:16.920> lower<00:06:17.130> profile<00:06:17.700> absolutely

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
is a little bit lower profile absolutely

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.230 
is a little bit lower profile absolutely
but<00:06:19.410> they<00:06:19.620> are<00:06:19.680> both<00:06:19.950> excellent<00:06:20.370> cases<00:06:20.970> so

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
but they are both excellent cases so

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.610 
but they are both excellent cases so
hopefully<00:06:21.630> that<00:06:21.930> helps<00:06:21.960> some<00:06:22.320> of<00:06:22.380> you<00:06:22.470> guys
