I'm gonna be telling you guys how to
build<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.200> satellite<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.700> um

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
build a satellite so um

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.460 
build a satellite so um
this<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.779> actually<00:00:07.049> something<00:00:07.230> I've<00:00:07.440> been

doing<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.950> my<00:00:08.040> grade<00:00:08.250> craft<00:00:08.660> series<00:00:09.660> but<00:00:10.440> you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
doing in my grade craft series but you

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.570 
doing in my grade craft series but you
guys<00:00:10.590> haven't<00:00:10.889> seen<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.130> yet<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.460> some

guys haven't seen that yet for some

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.890 
guys haven't seen that yet for some
reason<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.940> servers<00:00:12.269> been<00:00:12.450> down<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
reason the servers been down for a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
reason the servers been down for a
little<00:00:12.990> bit<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.650> yeah<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.099> I've<00:00:14.549> been<00:00:14.610> building

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
little bit so yeah so I've been building

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.390 
little bit so yeah so I've been building
kind<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.080> space<00:00:16.410> kind<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.920> stuff<00:00:17.130> and

kind of you know space kind of stuff and
it's<00:00:17.640> inspired<00:00:18.029> me<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> make<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> tutorial<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
it's inspired me to make a tutorial on a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.450 
it's inspired me to make a tutorial on a
on<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.970> satellite<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:22.100> if<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.220> guys<00:00:23.279> have

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
on a satellite here so if you guys have

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.189 
on a satellite here so if you guys have
any<00:00:23.609> ideas<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:24.060> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.240> doing<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> kind

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
any ideas I'm kind of doing like a kind

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.929 
any ideas I'm kind of doing like a kind
of<00:00:25.230> tutorial<00:00:25.650> serious<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.760> know

of tutorial serious I don't really know

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
of tutorial serious I don't really know
what<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.599> call<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.289> guys<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.560> any

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
iron and you can go like this make it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.060 
iron and you can go like this make it
into<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> little<00:01:02.359> little<00:01:03.359> circle<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.379> here

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
into a little little circle thing here

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
into a little little circle thing here
and<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> main<00:01:07.260> body<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and this is going to be the main body of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
and this is going to be the main body of
your<00:01:07.890> own<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.240> satellite<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.020> then

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
your own of your satellite here and then

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.510 
your own of your satellite here and then
you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.590> fill<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.950> on<00:01:13.950> either<00:01:14.640> side<00:01:15.030> here

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
you can fill this in on either side here

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
you can fill this in on either side here
and<00:01:17.750> then<00:01:18.750> we're<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
and then we're going to want to do is go

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.980 
and then we're going to want to do is go
just<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.060> gold<00:01:21.270> blocks<00:01:21.479> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
just like this with some gold blocks so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
just like this with some gold blocks so
I<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.259> maybe<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.890> wanted<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
I don't know maybe if you wanted to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.070 
I don't know maybe if you wanted to
build<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.909> survival<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
build this in survival be kind of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100 
build this in survival be kind of
difficult<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:27.360> would<00:01:27.810> need<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.049> go

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
difficult but you would need to go

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
difficult but you would need to go
mining<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.710> bit<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> gold

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
mining a little bit for all the gold

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.260 
mining a little bit for all the gold
here<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:31.579> does<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> take<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
here and does kind of take a lot of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
here and does kind of take a lot of
minor<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.920> then<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.430> mirror

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
minor and then you kind of just mirror

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630 
minor and then you kind of just mirror
it<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.570> top<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.310> actually<00:01:38.310> don't<00:01:38.490> need

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it on the top here actually don't need

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
it on the top here actually don't need
that<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.320> place<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.770> then

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that one place these like this and then

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
that one place these like this and then
there<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:45.210> main

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
there you go you have your main

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
there you go you have your main
satellite<00:01:46.110> thing<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.850> put

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
satellite thing and then you can put

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.639 
satellite thing and then you can put
some<00:01:48.149> common<00:01:48.420> stone<00:01:48.630> walls<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.079> either<00:01:49.259> side

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
some common stone walls on either side

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.999 
some common stone walls on either side
here<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.590> you're<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.860> creative

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
here and if you if you're in creative

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.490 
here and if you if you're in creative
mode<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.119> super<00:01:54.810> easy<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.320> build

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
mode this is super easy thing to build

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
mode this is super easy thing to build
and<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.909> hardly<00:01:57.090> takes<00:01:57.329> any<00:01:57.450> time<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.899> that's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and it hardly takes any time so that's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.490 
and it hardly takes any time so that's
cool<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> wall<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.579> either<00:01:59.670> side<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
cool you put a wall on either side and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
cool you put a wall on either side and
then<00:02:01.500> another<00:02:02.280> stone<00:02:02.759> slab<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.020> can

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
then another stone slab and then you can

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
then another stone slab and then you can
kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> make<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.920> solar<00:02:05.250> panel<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
kind of make this your solar panel I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
kind of make this your solar panel I
guess<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:07.099> ones<00:02:08.099> already<00:02:08.310> there

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
guess and you go one ones already there

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.029 
guess and you go one ones already there
two<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.330> three<00:02:09.360> four<00:02:09.869> five<00:02:10.200> six<00:02:10.470> seven<00:02:10.770> eight

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
two or three four five six seven eight

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.880 
two or three four five six seven eight
nine<00:02:11.069> ten

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
nine ten

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.100 
nine ten
and<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.640> these<00:02:12.790> are<00:02:12.850> solar<00:02:13.240> panels<00:02:13.510> maybe<00:02:13.990> it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
and then these are solar panels maybe it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.250 
and then these are solar panels maybe it
would<00:02:14.200> power<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:16.570> thing<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.080> you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
would power the the the thing and you

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.780 
would power the the the thing and you
just<00:02:17.290> use<00:02:17.530> daylight<00:02:17.830> sensors<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.610> would

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
just use daylight sensors and this would

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.700 
just use daylight sensors and this would
actually<00:02:18.820> be<00:02:19.120> kind<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> hard<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.050> I'm

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
actually be kind of hard to get and I'm

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.220 
actually be kind of hard to get and I'm
in<00:02:21.550> survival<00:02:22.240> because<00:02:22.450> daylight<00:02:22.750> sensors<00:02:23.080> are

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
in survival because daylight sensors are

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.740 
in survival because daylight sensors are
not<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.650> easiest<00:02:23.980> thing<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.520> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
not the easiest thing to get and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.730 
not the easiest thing to get and
obviously<00:02:25.750> don't<00:02:25.960> know<00:02:26.050> they<00:02:26.350> don't<00:02:26.470> power

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
obviously don't know they don't power

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.600 
obviously don't know they don't power
anything<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.550> oh<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.150> lip<00:02:28.330> just<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.870> oh

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
anything but I oh my lip just like oh

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.450 
anything but I oh my lip just like oh
crap<00:02:30.610> wasn't<00:02:30.910> counting<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.750> two<00:02:32.260> three<00:02:33.190> four

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
crap wasn't counting one two three four

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.400 
crap wasn't counting one two three four
five<00:02:33.760> six<00:02:34.060> seven<00:02:34.480> eight<00:02:34.570> nine<00:02:34.630> ten

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
five six seven eight nine ten

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.460 
five six seven eight nine ten
and<00:02:36.570> yet<00:02:37.570> these<00:02:37.660> look<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.170> solar

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
and yet these look just like solar

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.250 
and yet these look just like solar
panels<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:40.140> yeah<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:42.240> there<00:02:43.240> we<00:02:43.360> go<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.720> your

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
panels and yeah so there we go and your

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.910 
panels and yeah so there we go and your
your<00:02:45.190> uh<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:46.690> satellite<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.290> done<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.830> if

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
your uh your satellite is done and if

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
your uh your satellite is done and if
you<00:02:48.010> wanted<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.340> could<00:02:48.430> put<00:02:48.580> like<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.760> big

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
you wanted to you could put like a big

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.580 
you wanted to you could put like a big
earth<00:02:49.090> down<00:02:49.420> there<00:02:49.690> or<00:02:49.810> something<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:50.350> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
earth down there or something on that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.500 
earth down there or something on that
might<00:02:51.040> look<00:02:51.160> cool<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.489> you're<00:02:51.610> rebuilding<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
might look cool if you're rebuilding the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.740 
might look cool if you're rebuilding the
earth<00:02:52.660> or<00:02:53.410> whatever<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.310> don't<00:02:54.430> even<00:02:54.730> oh<00:02:54.850> didn't

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
earth or whatever I don't even oh didn't

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.479 
earth or whatever I don't even oh didn't
mean<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> drop<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.290> anyway<00:02:56.890> guys<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.340> did

mean to drop that anyway guys if you did

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.310
