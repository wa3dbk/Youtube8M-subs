now can't even see it there we go

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.799 
now can't even see it there we go
little<00:00:59.789> plants<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.660> I'll

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
little plants in there for now I'll

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
little plants in there for now I'll
probably<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.500> him<00:01:01.620> some<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.010> hay<00:01:02.190> or

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
probably go and get him some like hay or

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.830 
probably go and get him some like hay or
something<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> he<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> sleep<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
something that he can sleep in because I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
something that he can sleep in because I
think<00:01:03.899> tortoises<00:01:04.439> enjoy<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.909> yeah<00:01:06.119> he's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
think tortoises enjoy that but yeah he's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
think tortoises enjoy that but yeah he's
got<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.799> hiding<00:01:07.799> place<00:01:07.830> right<00:01:08.310> here

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
got those little hiding place right here

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
got those little hiding place right here
as<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.260> probably<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
as you can see probably go from this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.170 
as you can see probably go from this
side<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> looks<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.490> better<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
side it looks a little bit better you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
side it looks a little bit better you
can<00:01:12.659> go<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> hide<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> rest<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
can go in there and hide and the rest of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.219 
can go in there and hide and the rest of
the<00:01:14.790> cage<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.390> simple<00:01:15.630> she<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.080> do

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the cage is pretty simple she can do

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.440 
the cage is pretty simple she can do
more<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:17.220> she<00:01:17.340> gets<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> sees

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
more with it when she gets here and sees

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.140 
more with it when she gets here and sees
it<00:01:18.689> she<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.409> decorate<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.400> however<00:01:20.520> she<00:01:20.790> wants

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it she can decorate it however she wants

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.120 
it she can decorate it however she wants
but<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.540> right<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.560> instead

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but for right now I just put in instead

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
but for right now I just put in instead
of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> Eco<00:01:24.150> Earth<00:01:24.299> bedding<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.140> put

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
of the Eco Earth bedding there was I put

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
of the Eco Earth bedding there was I put
in<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.090> called<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.299> forest

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
in this I think it's called a forest

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.569 
in this I think it's called a forest
bedding<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.500> something<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.310> little

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
bedding or something it's like a little

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
getting something big like a like a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.170 
getting something big like a like a
socata<00:01:57.810> tortoise<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> red<00:01:59.969> foot

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
socata tortoise or you know a red foot

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.789 
socata tortoise or you know a red foot
tortoise<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.200> probably<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.560> gonna

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
tortoise then it's probably not gonna

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.319 
tortoise then it's probably not gonna
work<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.369> long<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> can

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
work for that long because as you can

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.609 
work for that long because as you can
see<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.750> footprint<00:02:04.140> isn't<00:02:04.439> massive

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
see that the footprint isn't massive

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.740 
see that the footprint isn't massive
although<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> pretty<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.570> big
