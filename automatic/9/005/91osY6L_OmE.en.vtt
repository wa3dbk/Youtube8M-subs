heavy-duty big board business Cummins

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.560 
heavy-duty big board business Cummins
had<00:00:25.279> decided<00:00:25.610> to<00:00:25.790> take<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.029> different<00:00:26.360> path

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
had decided to take a different path

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.160 
had decided to take a different path
with<00:00:27.170> regard<00:00:27.440> to<00:00:27.529> emissions<00:00:27.980> technology<00:00:29.170> well

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
with regard to emissions technology well

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.640 
with regard to emissions technology well
that<00:00:30.710> gave<00:00:30.950> Navistar<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:32.020> significant<00:00:33.020> dilemma

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
that gave Navistar a significant dilemma

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.210 
that gave Navistar a significant dilemma
should<00:00:34.489> we<00:00:34.640> afford<00:00:35.000> EGR<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:36.500> go<00:00:36.680> with<00:00:36.860> columns

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
should we afford EGR and go with columns

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.600 
should we afford EGR and go with columns
or<00:00:38.150> should<00:00:38.330> we<00:00:38.450> going<00:00:38.690> alone<00:00:39.160> we<00:00:40.160> really<00:00:40.460> had

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
or should we going alone we really had

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.390 
or should we going alone we really had
four<00:00:40.910> options<00:00:41.390> we<00:00:42.320> could<00:00:42.440> go<00:00:42.620> with<00:00:42.739> Cummins<00:00:43.160> at

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
four options we could go with Cummins at

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.049 
four options we could go with Cummins at
SCR<00:00:44.170> we<00:00:45.170> could<00:00:45.320> develop<00:00:45.590> our<00:00:45.980> 15<00:00:46.370> liter<00:00:46.610> engine

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
SCR we could develop our 15 liter engine

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.110 
SCR we could develop our 15 liter engine
from<00:00:47.629> scratch<00:00:48.129> we<00:00:49.129> could<00:00:49.280> find<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.610> partner<00:00:49.909> in

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
from scratch we could find a partner in

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.720 
from scratch we could find a partner in
Europe<00:00:50.449> or<00:00:50.629> somewhere<00:00:50.839> to<00:00:51.620> develop<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.129> 15

Europe or somewhere to develop a 15
liter<00:00:52.940> engine<00:00:53.360> or<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.140> could<00:00:54.290> find<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.620> North

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
liter engine or we could find a North

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.390 
liter engine or we could find a North
American<00:00:54.979> solution<00:00:56.140> well<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:57.800> chose<00:00:58.040> what<00:00:58.370> we

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
American solution well we chose what we

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.549 
American solution well we chose what we
thought<00:00:58.729> was<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:58.970> best<00:00:59.120> possible<00:00:59.989> solution

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
thought was the best possible solution

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.040 
thought was the best possible solution
out<00:01:00.769> of<00:01:00.920> all<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.430> above<00:01:01.519> and<00:01:01.909> we<00:01:02.540> chose<00:01:02.780> the

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
out of all of the above and we chose the

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.550 
out of all of the above and we chose the
Katzie<00:01:03.589> 15<00:01:04.159> as<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.670> foundation<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.290> one<00:01:06.409> is

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
Katzie 15 as a foundation so that one is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.850 
Katzie 15 as a foundation so that one is
now<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.830> max<00:01:07.220> worse<00:01:07.490> 15<00:01:08.000> engine<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.740> an

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
now the max worse 15 engine this is an

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.420 
now the max worse 15 engine this is an
engine<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.400> frankly<00:01:11.120> nobody<00:01:11.720> disputes

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430

remember<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:29.030> 2009<00:01:29.930> we<00:01:30.829> demonstrated<00:01:31.640> what

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
remember in 2009 we demonstrated what

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.200 
remember in 2009 we demonstrated what
was<00:01:32.299> then<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.840> first<00:01:33.590> running<00:01:34.100> version<00:01:34.729> it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
was then the first running version it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.420 
was then the first running version it
wasn't<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.689> prototype<00:01:36.200> how<00:01:36.799> can<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.070> call<00:01:37.250> an

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
wasn't a prototype how can you call an

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.370 
wasn't a prototype how can you call an
engine<00:01:37.759> with<00:01:37.909> five<00:01:38.420> hundred<00:01:38.630> billion<00:01:39.020> miles

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
engine with five hundred billion miles

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.649 
engine with five hundred billion miles
on<00:01:39.649> it<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.859> prototype<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:41.149> was<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.420> first

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
on it a prototype it was the first

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.300 
on it a prototype it was the first
version<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.259> then<00:01:42.500> what<00:01:42.710> was<00:01:42.890> going<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.130> become

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
version of then what was going to become

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.740 
version of then what was going to become
the<00:01:44.090> max<00:01:44.329> force<00:01:44.689> 15<00:01:45.609> it<00:01:46.609> was<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.789> combination<00:01:47.240> of

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
the max force 15 it was a combination of

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.469 
the max force 15 it was a combination of
a<00:01:48.079> caterpillar<00:01:48.890> proven<00:01:49.609> block<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.090> hardware

develop<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.650> 15<00:02:25.070> liter<00:02:25.280> engine<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.730> all

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
develop a 15 liter engine at all

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.949
