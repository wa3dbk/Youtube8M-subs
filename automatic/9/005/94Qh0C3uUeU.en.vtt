the last four years you'll dig to about
half<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.740> meter<00:02:04.950> depth<00:02:05.390> then<00:02:06.390> she'll<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.659> into<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
half a meter depth then she'll go into a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
half a meter depth then she'll go into a
trance<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.560> she'll<00:02:07.710> start<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> lay<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
trance and then she'll start to lay the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.010 
trance and then she'll start to lay the
eggs

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
eggs

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.230

and<00:02:09.230> that's<00:02:09.980> a<00:02:10.220> first<00:02:10.640> stage<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.150> the

and that's a first stage of the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.450

lifecycle<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.560> also<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> first<00:02:13.190> stage

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
lifecycle but it's also the first stage

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.040 
lifecycle but it's also the first stage
where<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.940> eggs<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.480> be<00:02:14.570> subject<00:02:14.990> to

where the eggs can be subject to
predation<00:02:15.380> they<00:02:16.340> get<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> lot<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.730> natural

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
