vision comm and my review today is at
the<00:00:09.459> canon<00:00:09.790> EF<00:00:10.000> 35mm<00:00:10.840> 8<00:00:11.290> @f<00:00:11.620> 2.0<00:00:12.309> it's<00:00:13.269> this

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
the canon EF 35mm 8 @f 2.0 it's this

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.410 
the canon EF 35mm 8 @f 2.0 it's this
little<00:00:14.469> primer<00:00:15.280> I've<00:00:15.519> got<00:00:15.670> my<00:00:15.849> mounted<00:00:16.270> on<00:00:16.330> the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
little primer I've got my mounted on the

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.320 
little primer I've got my mounted on the
5d<00:00:16.960> here<00:00:17.439> so<00:00:18.430> it<00:00:18.730> gets<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:19.029> bit<00:00:19.150> neglected

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
5d here so it gets a bit neglected

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.019 
5d here so it gets a bit neglected
really<00:00:19.990> on<00:00:20.830> Amazon<00:00:21.430> you'll<00:00:21.609> see<00:00:21.789> there<00:00:21.939> are

really on Amazon you'll see there are

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.470 
really on Amazon you'll see there are
1500<00:00:22.930> reviews<00:00:23.109> for<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.740> Canon<00:00:24.310> 15<00:00:25.119> millimeter

1500 reviews for the Canon 15 millimeter
F<00:00:25.689> 1<00:00:25.960> point<00:00:26.170> 8<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.619> nifty<00:00:26.800> 50<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.390> this<00:00:28.660> thing

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.369 
F 1 point 8 and nifty 50 and this thing

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
gets what about 300 reviews I think and

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.810 
gets what about 300 reviews I think and
it's<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.590> shame<00:00:32.769> because<00:00:32.830> it<00:00:33.160> works<00:00:33.309> well<00:00:33.610> for

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
it's a shame because it works well for

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's a shame because it works well for
two<00:00:34.570> main<00:00:34.750> reasons<00:00:34.920> firstly<00:00:35.920> let's<00:00:36.129> look<00:00:36.220> at

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
two main reasons firstly let's look at

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.689 
two main reasons firstly let's look at
it<00:00:36.549> in<00:00:36.879> terms<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.330> the<00:00:37.540> use<00:00:38.530> on<00:00:38.710> crop<00:00:39.040> cameras<00:00:39.519> a

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
it in terms of the use on crop cameras a

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.670 
it in terms of the use on crop cameras a
like<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.000> 7d<00:00:40.479> or<00:00:40.659> any<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.049> the<00:00:41.170> ones<00:00:41.320> with<00:00:41.530> an

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
like the 7d or any of the ones with an

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.289 
like the 7d or any of the ones with an
aps-c<00:00:42.269> sensor<00:00:43.269> so<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.629> 1.6<00:00:44.670> ratio<00:00:45.670> magnifying

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:46.299 
aps-c sensor so a 1.6 ratio magnifying

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.649 
aps-c sensor so a 1.6 ratio magnifying
sensor<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.559> not<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:47.890> full<00:00:48.070> frames<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:49.390> lens

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
sensor so not the full frames this lens

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.539 
sensor so not the full frames this lens
on<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:50.019> type<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.559> camera<00:00:50.979> works<00:00:51.190> out<00:00:51.400> at

on that type of camera works out at

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.729 
on that type of camera works out at
around<00:00:51.729> 256<00:00:52.720> millimeter<00:00:53.260> something<00:00:53.589> like

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
around 256 millimeter something like

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.789 
around 256 millimeter something like
that<00:00:54.059> annex<00:00:55.059> F<00:00:55.269> 2.0<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.199> you'd<00:00:56.470> be<00:00:56.589> hard

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
that annex F 2.0 and you'd be hard

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.340 
that annex F 2.0 and you'd be hard
pushed<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.250> find<00:00:57.640> another<00:00:58.170> affordable<00:00:59.170> way<00:00:59.320> of

pushed to find another affordable way of

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.829 
pushed to find another affordable way of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
getting to a more or less 15 millimeter

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.469 
getting to a more or less 15 millimeter
field<00:01:02.199> of<00:01:02.409> view<00:01:02.820> without<00:01:03.820> spending<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.330> large

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
field of view without spending a large

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.390 
field of view without spending a large
amount<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.809> money<00:01:04.989> on<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.439> cropped<00:01:05.799> camera<00:01:06.159> so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
amount of money on a cropped camera so

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.670 
amount of money on a cropped camera so
that<00:01:06.939> 50<00:01:07.299> millimeter<00:01:07.750> field<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.140> view<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.470> seen

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that 50 millimeter field of view is seen

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.290 
that 50 millimeter field of view is seen
as<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.040> standard<00:01:09.580> it's<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:09.910> one<00:01:10.090> that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
as the standard it's the one that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.080 
as the standard it's the one that
supposedly<00:01:10.960> your<00:01:11.200> eye<00:01:11.230> sees<00:01:11.800> at<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.250> if

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
supposedly your eye sees at and if

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.850 
supposedly your eye sees at and if
you're<00:01:13.210> looking<00:01:13.300> for<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.690> fast<00:01:14.140> prime<00:01:14.650> that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
you're looking for a fast prime that

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.000 
you're looking for a fast prime that
actually<00:01:15.250> hits<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.820> range<00:01:16.950> including<00:01:17.950> the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
actually hits that range including the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.830 
actually hits that range including the
crop<00:01:18.190> factor<00:01:18.370> then<00:01:19.120> this<00:01:19.270> is<00:01:19.420> well<00:01:19.720> worth

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
crop factor then this is well worth

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.370 
crop factor then this is well worth
looking<00:01:20.050> at<00:01:20.320> for<00:01:20.530> 300<00:01:21.040> bucks<00:01:21.220> or<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:23.170> I

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
looking at for 300 bucks or so but I

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.440 
looking at for 300 bucks or so but I
find<00:01:23.650> it<00:01:23.860> works<00:01:24.040> really<00:01:24.310> particularly<00:01:25.270> well

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
find it works really particularly well

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.450 
find it works really particularly well
if<00:01:25.780> you're<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.230> a<00:01:26.290> full<00:01:26.620> frame<00:01:26.800> body<00:01:27.160> where<00:01:27.370> it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
if you're on a full frame body where it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.860 
if you're on a full frame body where it
gets<00:01:27.610> tough<00:01:27.730> you<00:01:27.880> get<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.120> full<00:01:28.330> 35

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
gets tough you get the full 35

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170 
gets tough you get the full 35
millimeter<00:01:29.440> view<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.670> true<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.030> there

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
millimeter view now it's true that there

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.390 
millimeter view now it's true that there
are<00:01:31.270> quite<00:01:31.510> a<00:01:31.540> lot<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.890> zoom<00:01:32.890> lenses<00:01:33.220> that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
are quite a lot of zoom lenses that

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.910 
are quite a lot of zoom lenses that
cover<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:33.820> range<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.470> know<00:01:35.530> including

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
cover that range you know including

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.399 
cover that range you know including
course<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.370> L<00:01:36.490> Series<00:01:36.820> ones<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.300> 24<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.900> 105

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
course the L Series ones the 24 to 105

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.460 
course the L Series ones the 24 to 105
and<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.010> 24<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.610> 70<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.690> even<00:01:40.990> but<00:01:41.230> even<00:01:41.409> the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and the 24 to 70 and even but even the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.390 
and the 24 to 70 and even but even the
24<00:01:41.860> 7<00:01:42.159> g<00:01:42.250> stops<00:01:42.670> our<00:01:42.880> only<00:01:43.210> at<00:01:43.390> F<00:01:43.659> 2.8<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.740> so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
24 7 g stops our only at F 2.8 and so

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.440 
24 7 g stops our only at F 2.8 and so
having<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.880> 2.0<00:01:46.710> gives<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.850> extra

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
having it a 2.0 gives you the extra

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.719 
having it a 2.0 gives you the extra
narrow<00:01:49.960> depth<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.500> field<00:01:50.800> better<00:01:51.130> performance

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
narrow depth of field better performance

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.670 
narrow depth of field better performance
in<00:01:51.880> low<00:01:52.090> light<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.600> merging<00:01:53.080> see<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.470> lot

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
in low light and merging see it's a lot

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.590 
in low light and merging see it's a lot
smaller<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.280> more<00:01:54.400> manageable<00:01:54.460> than<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.450> big

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
smaller and more manageable than the big

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.200

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
about the field of view that this lens

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.330 
about the field of view that this lens
gives<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:05.680> very<00:02:05.770> good<00:02:06.159> for

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
gives you is that it's very good for

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.699 
gives you is that it's very good for
environmental<00:02:07.000> portraits<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:08.229> tendency

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
environmental portraits the tendency

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.919 
environmental portraits the tendency
that<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.069> had<00:02:09.280> especially<00:02:09.729> when<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:09.879> started<00:02:10.360> was

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
that I had especially when I started was

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.720 
that I had especially when I started was
to<00:02:10.959> zoom<00:02:11.379> in<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.800> everything<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:12.550> knew

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
to zoom in on everything because I knew

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to zoom in on everything because I knew
I<00:02:12.760> wanted<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.150> cut<00:02:13.360> out

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
I wanted to cut out

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.260 
I wanted to cut out
background<00:02:14.170> clutter<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.490> putting

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
background clutter and so that putting

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.180 
background clutter and so that putting
an<00:02:16.360> 85<00:02:16.780> millimeter<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.650> something<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
an 85 millimeter on or something and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.280 
an 85 millimeter on or something and
like<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.700> doing<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.150> tight<00:02:19.720> crop<00:02:20.080> on

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
like just doing a tight crop on

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.230 
like just doing a tight crop on
somebody's<00:02:20.680> face<00:02:20.890> for<00:02:21.130> example<00:02:21.240> would

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
somebody's face for example would

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.670 
somebody's face for example would
eliminate<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.810> clutter<00:02:22.930> but<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.530> also

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
eliminate the clutter but it also

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.550 
eliminate the clutter but it also
eliminates<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.370> context<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.020> harder<00:02:26.440> to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
eliminates the context so it's harder to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.930 
eliminates the context so it's harder to
shoot<00:02:26.800> with<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.130> lens<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:27.580> you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
shoot with this lens because you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.280 
shoot with this lens because you
obviously<00:02:28.210> in<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.080> small<00:02:29.920> room<00:02:30.570> if<00:02:31.570> it's<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.020> you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
obviously in a small room if it's a you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.900 
obviously in a small room if it's a you
know<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.440> similar<00:02:32.890> kind<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.130> distance<00:02:33.490> from<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
know a similar kind of distance from the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.910 
know a similar kind of distance from the
subject<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.480> get<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.660> much<00:02:34.870> wider<00:02:35.260> view<00:02:35.800> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
subject you get a much wider view of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.730 
subject you get a much wider view of
what's<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.459> environment<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.870> also<00:02:38.350> for

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
what's in that environment but also for

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.110 
what's in that environment but also for
that<00:02:38.830> reason<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> lot<00:02:39.820> more<00:02:39.970> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that reason I like it a lot more it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.210 
that reason I like it a lot more it
tells<00:02:40.300> more<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.840> story<00:02:41.170> it's<00:02:41.980> very<00:02:42.130> good

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
tells more of the story it's very good

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.030 
tells more of the story it's very good
for<00:02:42.280> street<00:02:42.610> photography<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:43.300> well<00:02:43.830> where<00:02:44.830> you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
for street photography as well where you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.410 
for street photography as well where you
can<00:02:45.340> get<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.880> kind<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.239> broader<00:02:47.110> view<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.100> things

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
can get a kind of broader view on things

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
can get a kind of broader view on things
so<00:02:49.420> those<00:02:50.140> are<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:51.040> main<00:02:51.280> uses<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.360> put<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.200> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
so those are the main uses I put it to I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
so those are the main uses I put it to I
often<00:02:53.770> shoot<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.850> lens<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.300> 35

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
often shoot with a this lens the 35

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
often shoot with a this lens the 35
millimeter<00:02:55.959> on<00:02:56.410> one<00:02:56.620> body<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.190> an<00:02:57.310> 85

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
millimeter on one body and an 85

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.720 
millimeter on one body and an 85
millimeter<00:02:58.300> on<00:02:58.690> another<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.550> get<00:03:00.700> a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
millimeter on another and so I can get a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
millimeter on another and so I can get a
narrow<00:03:01.030> depth<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.450> field<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:01.989> would<00:03:02.230> like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
narrow depth of field that I would like

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.590 
narrow depth of field that I would like
say<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.459> know<00:03:03.550> for<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:03.910> blurred<00:03:04.330> background

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
say you know for that blurred background

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.930 
say you know for that blurred background
or<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.470> for<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:05.800> fast<00:03:06.160> enough<00:03:06.400> shutter<00:03:06.580> speed

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
or just for a fast enough shutter speed

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.300 
or just for a fast enough shutter speed
if<00:03:07.120> I'm<00:03:07.270> working<00:03:07.480> indoors<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.350> then<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.130> can

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
if I'm working indoors and then I can

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.970 
if I'm working indoors and then I can
swap<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> 85<00:03:10.150> millimeter<00:03:10.690> for<00:03:11.050> for

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
swap to the 85 millimeter for for

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.310 
swap to the 85 millimeter for for
close-ups<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.520> keep<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> 35<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
close-ups and keep the 35 for the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.840 
close-ups and keep the 35 for the
broader<00:03:15.070> view

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
broader view

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.370 
broader view
now<00:03:15.940> if<00:03:16.030> composition<00:03:16.570> does<00:03:16.750> take<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> bit<00:03:17.200> more

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
now if composition does take a bit more

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.710 
now if composition does take a bit more
effort<00:03:17.640> because<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.910> make<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.269> more

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
effort because you just make this more

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.930 
effort because you just make this more
in<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.110> but<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.830> find<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.190> works<00:03:21.310> really<00:03:21.519> well

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
in it but I find it works really well

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.930 
in it but I find it works really well
so<00:03:22.450> for<00:03:23.110> 300<00:03:23.470> bucks<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:23.799> do<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.950> get<00:03:24.130> well<00:03:24.459> it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
so for 300 bucks what do you get well it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.080 
so for 300 bucks what do you get well it
looks<00:03:25.360> kind<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:26.250> somewhere<00:03:27.250> between<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.820> F

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
looks kind of somewhere between the F

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.009 
looks kind of somewhere between the F
1.8<00:03:28.780> 50<00:03:29.170> millimeter<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.209> 1.4<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.720> it's

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
1.8 50 millimeter and the 1.4 so it's

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.370 
1.8 50 millimeter and the 1.4 so it's
not<00:03:32.260> quite<00:03:32.620> as<00:03:32.799> sturdy<00:03:33.070> as<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:34.019> 1.4<00:03:35.019> 50

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
not quite as sturdy as the 1.4 50

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.930 
not quite as sturdy as the 1.4 50
millimeter<00:03:35.739> if<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:35.950> know<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.280> lens<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:36.850> it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
millimeter if you know that lens but it

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.759 
millimeter if you know that lens but it
does<00:03:37.060> feel<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> little<00:03:37.330> bit<00:03:37.720> more<00:03:37.900> solid<00:03:38.110> than

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
does feel a little bit more solid than

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.850 
does feel a little bit more solid than
the<00:03:39.100> 50<00:03:39.519> millimeter<00:03:39.730> F<00:03:40.299> 1<00:03:40.600> point<00:03:40.870> 8<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.650> made

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
the 50 millimeter F 1 point 8 it is made

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.789 
the 50 millimeter F 1 point 8 it is made
of<00:03:41.980> plastic<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.930> does<00:03:44.049> have<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.290> manual

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
of plastic but it does have a manual

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.990 
of plastic but it does have a manual
focus<00:03:45.130> ring<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:47.019> metal<00:03:47.380> mount<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.820> that's

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
focus ring and a metal mount so that's

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.400 
focus ring and a metal mount so that's
good<00:03:49.239> but<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.630> doesn't<00:03:49.870> feel<00:03:49.989> particularly

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
good but it doesn't feel particularly

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.490 
good but it doesn't feel particularly
sturdy<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:50.950> will<00:03:51.160> say<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.459> part<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.870> it's

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
sturdy I will say that part but it's

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.949 
sturdy I will say that part but it's
sharp<00:03:53.890> even<00:03:54.220> at<00:03:54.430> F<00:03:54.610> 2.0<00:03:55.239> certainly<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:55.870> the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
sharp even at F 2.0 certainly in the

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.259 
sharp even at F 2.0 certainly in the
center<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.610> reaches<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> most

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
center it reaches it to the most

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.000 
center it reaches it to the most
sharpness<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.049> lot<00:03:59.290> allowances<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.769> know

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
sharpness like a lot allowances you know

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.850 
sharpness like a lot allowances you know
from<00:04:00.280> 4.45<00:04:01.150> upwards<00:04:01.810> but<00:04:02.440> if<00:04:02.530> you're<00:04:02.650> buying

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
from 4.45 upwards but if you're buying

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.740 
from 4.45 upwards but if you're buying
this<00:04:03.040> lens<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.579> because<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.090> want<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.510> use

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
this lens it's because you want to use

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.100 
this lens it's because you want to use
it<00:04:04.959> wide<00:04:05.170> open<00:04:06.390> either<00:04:07.390> for<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.720> low<00:04:07.870> light

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
it wide open either for the low light

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.500 
it wide open either for the low light
performance<00:04:08.140> or<00:04:08.769> for<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.400> separation<00:04:10.299> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
performance or for the separation you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.810 
performance or for the separation you
get<00:04:10.690> with<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.049> narrow<00:04:11.350> depth<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.829> field<00:04:12.040> so

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
get with the narrow depth of field so

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.729 
get with the narrow depth of field so
you<00:04:13.510> should<00:04:13.660> be<00:04:13.750> aware<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:13.989> course<00:04:14.260> because

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
you should be aware of course because

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.890 
you should be aware of course because
it's<00:04:14.950> 35<00:04:15.370> millimeter<00:04:15.820> you<00:04:16.329> don't<00:04:16.510> get<00:04:16.690> that

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
it's 35 millimeter you don't get that

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.890 
it's 35 millimeter you don't get that
way<00:04:17.169> for<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.530> thin<00:04:17.919> type<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.600> depth<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.720> field

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
way for a thin type of depth of field

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.350 
way for a thin type of depth of field
that<00:04:20.440> f<00:04:20.680> 2.0<00:04:21.130> V<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.370> might<00:04:21.400> get<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:22.000> with<00:04:22.210> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
that f 2.0 V you might get to with the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.620 
that f 2.0 V you might get to with the
85<00:04:22.840> millimeter

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
85 millimeter

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.850 
85 millimeter
2.0<00:04:24.350> well<00:04:24.650> surly<00:04:24.890> 135<00:04:25.730> nanometer<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.470> 2.0<00:04:27.470> so

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
2.0 well surly 135 nanometer a 2.0 so

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.970 
2.0 well surly 135 nanometer a 2.0 so
it's<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:29.660> gives<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.020> bit<00:04:30.290> it's<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.770> little

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
it's it gives you a bit it's a little

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.190 
it's it gives you a bit it's a little
bit<00:04:31.100> more<00:04:31.310> forgiving<00:04:31.880> than<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:33.110> know

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
bit more forgiving than you know

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.310 
bit more forgiving than you know
shooting<00:04:33.650> 85<00:04:34.160> 1.2<00:04:34.820> or<00:04:35.030> something<00:04:35.360> uh<00:04:35.540> but<00:04:36.200> if

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
shooting 85 1.2 or something uh but if

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.110 
shooting 85 1.2 or something uh but if
you<00:04:36.500> do<00:04:36.650> get<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:36.890> that<00:04:37.460> narrow<00:04:37.670> depth<00:04:37.940> of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
you do get that that narrow depth of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.730 
you do get that that narrow depth of
field<00:04:38.330> especially<00:04:39.170> obviously<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
field especially obviously if the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.190 
field especially obviously if the
subject<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.250> close<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.670> you<00:04:40.790> which<00:04:41.630> because

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
subject is close to you which because

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.900 
subject is close to you which because
it's<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.410> has<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> wide<00:04:43.130> field<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.550> view<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.760> can

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
it's a has a wide field of view you can

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.570 
it's a has a wide field of view you can
get<00:04:44.210> up<00:04:44.480> close<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:44.930> your<00:04:45.260> subject<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:46.340> still

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
get up close to your subject and still

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.220 
get up close to your subject and still
get<00:04:46.760> them<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.770> it's<00:04:49.000> round<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.090> edges<00:04:50.810> you<00:04:51.110> do

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
get them in it's round the edges you do

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.960 
get them in it's round the edges you do
get<00:04:51.410> some<00:04:51.620> vignette<00:04:51.980> in<00:04:52.160> especially<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.880> know

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
get some vignette in especially you know

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.060 
get some vignette in especially you know
when<00:04:53.180> it's<00:04:53.270> wide<00:04:53.450> open<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.620> can<00:04:54.740> take<00:04:54.920> that

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
when it's wide open you can take that

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.280 
when it's wide open you can take that
out<00:04:55.130> if<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.520> don't<00:04:55.700> like<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.090> or<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.780> my<00:04:56.870> case<00:04:56.930> I

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
out if you don't like it or in my case I

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.990 
out if you don't like it or in my case I
tend<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.680> leave<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.040> in<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.340> kind<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.580> like<00:04:58.790> that

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
tend to leave it in I kind of like that

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.450 
tend to leave it in I kind of like that
that<00:04:59.360> feel<00:04:59.710> but<00:05:00.710> obviously<00:05:00.950> that's<00:05:01.310> a

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
that feel but obviously that's a

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.520 
that feel but obviously that's a
personal<00:05:01.820> choice<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.750> let's<00:05:03.200> look<00:05:03.320> at<00:05:03.440> the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
personal choice so let's look at the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.400 
personal choice so let's look at the
cons<00:05:03.830> well<00:05:04.430> I'm<00:05:04.790> touched<00:05:05.390> on<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.990> couple<00:05:06.050> of

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
cons well I'm touched on a couple of

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.950 
cons well I'm touched on a couple of
them<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:07.070> isn't<00:05:07.280> really<00:05:07.400> that<00:05:07.490> sturdy<00:05:08.030> and

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
them it isn't really that sturdy and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.350 
them it isn't really that sturdy and
it's<00:05:09.620> not<00:05:09.770> weather<00:05:10.010> sealed<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:10.790> if<00:05:11.060> you're<00:05:11.270> in

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
it's not weather sealed so if you're in

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.000 
it's not weather sealed so if you're in
extreme<00:05:11.720> conditions<00:05:11.900> it's<00:05:12.410> probably<00:05:12.710> not<00:05:12.860> the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
extreme conditions it's probably not the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.370 
extreme conditions it's probably not the
one<00:05:13.130> for<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.760> another<00:05:14.750> one<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.200> cons

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
one for you and another one of the cons

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.120 
one for you and another one of the cons
is<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:16.520> it's<00:05:16.760> focusing<00:05:17.480> is<00:05:17.690> very<00:05:17.900> buzzy<00:05:18.470> I'll

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
is that it's focusing is very buzzy I'll

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.950 
is that it's focusing is very buzzy I'll
give<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.460> an<00:05:19.550> example<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.060> so<00:05:20.330> if<00:05:20.600> I<00:05:20.750> just

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
give you an example of that so if I just

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.800 
give you an example of that so if I just
died

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
died

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.080 
died
and<00:05:23.810> if<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.110> can<00:05:24.230> hear<00:05:24.380> that<00:05:24.500> it's<00:05:25.460> picking

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
and if you can hear that it's picking

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.990 
and if you can hear that it's picking
that<00:05:26.330> up<00:05:26.450> in<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.690> mic<00:05:27.220> it's<00:05:28.220> your<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.700> if

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
that up in the mic it's your and if

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.620 
that up in the mic it's your and if
you're<00:05:29.030> in<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.240> quiet<00:05:29.450> environment<00:05:31.450> vowels<00:05:32.450> in

little<00:05:34.430> bit<00:05:34.700> distracting<00:05:34.970> if<00:05:35.390> you're<00:05:35.570> out<00:05:35.660> on

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
little bit distracting if you're out on

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.750 
little bit distracting if you're out on
the<00:05:35.930> street<00:05:36.230> or<00:05:36.470> you're<00:05:36.860> they're<00:05:37.280> taking

around<00:05:38.960> it's<00:05:39.350> not<00:05:39.560> really<00:05:39.800> much<00:05:39.950> of<00:05:39.980> an<00:05:40.220> issue

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
around it's not really much of an issue

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.730 
around it's not really much of an issue
but<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:41.120> doesn't<00:05:41.870> give<00:05:42.290> you<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.470> most

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
but it doesn't give you the most

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.250 
but it doesn't give you the most
confidence<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:44.210> it<00:05:44.480> doesn't<00:05:44.690> have<00:05:44.780> USM

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
confidence and it doesn't have USM

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.000 
confidence and it doesn't have USM
focusing<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:46.910> it's<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.840> didn't<00:05:48.740> find<00:05:48.860> it

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
focusing so it's I didn't find it

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.920 
focusing so it's I didn't find it
particularly<00:05:49.310> slow<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.880> be<00:05:49.970> honest<00:05:50.240> but<00:05:50.600> you

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
particularly slow to be honest but you

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.630 
particularly slow to be honest but you
know<00:05:50.990> it's<00:05:51.110> definitely<00:05:51.260> one<00:05:51.770> mark<00:05:52.010> against<00:05:52.460> it

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
know it's definitely one mark against it

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.370 
know it's definitely one mark against it
it<00:05:52.790> kind<00:05:53.030> of<00:05:53.090> needs<00:05:53.240> an<00:05:53.420> update<00:05:53.660> it<00:05:54.050> looks<00:05:54.230> like

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
it kind of needs an update it looks like

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.290 
it kind of needs an update it looks like
it's<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.620> very<00:05:54.800> kind<00:05:55.250> of<00:05:55.280> old<00:05:55.520> design<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.150> hasn't

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
it's a very kind of old design it hasn't

it's a very kind of old design it hasn't

really been improved recently which is a

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.850 
really been improved recently which is a
strange<00:05:58.970> thing<00:05:59.390> when<00:06:00.320> you<00:06:00.410> consider<00:06:00.740> that

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
strange thing when you consider that

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.610 
strange thing when you consider that
it's<00:06:01.370> nearest<00:06:02.090> direct<00:06:02.600> rival<00:06:03.050> is<00:06:03.230> thirty

five-millimeter F one point four which

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.480 
five-millimeter F one point four which
is<00:06:05.930> like<00:06:06.380> thirteen<00:06:06.770> hundred<00:06:07.100> dollars<00:06:07.130> and

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
is like thirteen hundred dollars and

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.730 
is like thirteen hundred dollars and
there's<00:06:07.610> nothing<00:06:07.970> in<00:06:08.090> between<00:06:08.620> you'd<00:06:09.620> be<00:06:09.710> a

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
there's nothing in between you'd be a

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.200 
there's nothing in between you'd be a
good<00:06:09.890> one<00:06:09.980> for<00:06:10.130> Sigma<00:06:10.520> actually<00:06:10.910> if<00:06:11.000> they<00:06:11.150> were

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
good one for Sigma actually if they were

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.660 
good one for Sigma actually if they were
making<00:06:11.630> a<00:06:11.840> full<00:06:12.080> frame<00:06:12.380> capable<00:06:13.130> thirty<00:06:13.460> five

making a full frame capable thirty five

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.450 
making a full frame capable thirty five
millimeter<00:06:14.000> lens<00:06:14.510> similar<00:06:15.320> to<00:06:15.440> their<00:06:15.650> 50<00:06:16.340> and

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
millimeter lens similar to their 50 and

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.060 
millimeter lens similar to their 50 and
85<00:06:16.750> that<00:06:17.750> would<00:06:17.900> definitely<00:06:18.050> be<00:06:18.320> worth

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
85 that would definitely be worth

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.970 
85 that would definitely be worth
looking<00:06:19.430> at<00:06:19.600> so<00:06:20.600> that's<00:06:20.780> the<00:06:21.050> pecans<00:06:21.620> as<00:06:21.800> far

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
looking at so that's the pecans as far

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.700 
looking at so that's the pecans as far
as<00:06:22.070> its<00:06:22.250> sturdiness<00:06:23.090> its<00:06:23.630> slightly<00:06:24.440> slow<00:06:24.650> on

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
as its sturdiness its slightly slow on

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.350 
as its sturdiness its slightly slow on
focusing<00:06:25.520> and<00:06:25.730> it's<00:06:25.910> slightly<00:06:26.150> buzzy<00:06:27.070> its<00:06:28.360> and

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
focusing and it's slightly buzzy its and

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.040 
focusing and it's slightly buzzy its and
it<00:06:29.480> doesn't<00:06:29.750> have<00:06:29.870> a<00:06:30.110> full<00:06:31.010> time<00:06:31.360> manual<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
it doesn't have a full time manual the

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.020 
it doesn't have a full time manual the
manual<00:06:33.080> override<00:06:33.680> focus<00:06:34.250> so<00:06:34.460> either<00:06:34.700> it's<00:06:34.940> a

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
manual override focus so either it's a

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.450 
manual override focus so either it's a
manual<00:06:35.479> all<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.810> time<00:06:35.990> or<00:06:36.229> it

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
manual all the time or it

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.640 
manual all the time or it
and<00:06:37.630> autofocus<00:06:38.630> all<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.050> time<00:06:39.259> you<00:06:39.410> can't

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
and autofocus all the time you can't

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.309 
and autofocus all the time you can't
tweak<00:06:40.130> it<00:06:40.370> when<00:06:40.910> it's<00:06:41.030> an<00:06:41.150> autofocus<00:06:41.389> using

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
tweak it when it's an autofocus using

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.770 
tweak it when it's an autofocus using
the<00:06:42.440> focus<00:06:42.830> ring<00:06:43.130> as<00:06:43.310> you<00:06:43.400> can<00:06:43.580> with<00:06:43.780> more

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
the focus ring as you can with more

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.520 
the focus ring as you can with more
modern<00:06:45.139> designs<00:06:46.030> so<00:06:47.030> if<00:06:47.419> as<00:06:47.960> I<00:06:47.990> mentioned<00:06:48.410> its

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
modern designs so if as I mentioned its

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.760 
modern designs so if as I mentioned its
rival<00:06:49.069> in<00:06:49.340> terms<00:06:49.759> of<00:06:49.990> direct<00:06:50.990> competition<00:06:51.319> is

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
rival in terms of direct competition is

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.730 
rival in terms of direct competition is
the<00:06:52.310> 35<00:06:52.699> millimeter<00:06:53.000> 1.4<00:06:53.840> which<00:06:53.990> I<00:06:54.110> have<00:06:54.289> used

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
the 35 millimeter 1.4 which I have used

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.770 
the 35 millimeter 1.4 which I have used
then<00:06:54.979> I<00:06:55.009> might<00:06:55.160> do<00:06:55.280> a<00:06:55.310> review<00:06:55.699> of<00:06:55.759> in<00:06:56.479> full

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
then I might do a review of in full

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.230 
then I might do a review of in full
later<00:06:57.110> on<00:06:57.349> and<00:06:57.620> it's<00:06:58.250> a<00:06:58.370> peach<00:06:58.610> of<00:06:58.819> a<00:06:58.910> lens<00:06:59.090> I

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
later on and it's a peach of a lens I

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.010 
later on and it's a peach of a lens I
have<00:06:59.389> to<00:06:59.509> say<00:06:59.660> absolutely<00:07:00.349> gorgeous<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:00.860> 1.4

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
have to say absolutely gorgeous the 1.4

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.420 
have to say absolutely gorgeous the 1.4
depth<00:07:03.020> of<00:07:03.199> field<00:07:03.470> you<00:07:03.710> get<00:07:03.919> is<00:07:04.160> kind<00:07:04.370> of

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
depth of field you get is kind of

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.059 
depth of field you get is kind of
amazing<00:07:04.729> where<00:07:05.060> you<00:07:05.240> can<00:07:05.449> be<00:07:05.750> really<00:07:06.560> tight<00:07:06.860> on

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:07.069 
amazing where you can be really tight on

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:08.860 
amazing where you can be really tight on
something<00:07:07.490> and<00:07:07.639> keep<00:07:07.819> that<00:07:07.970> very<00:07:08.150> sharp<00:07:08.569> and

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
something and keep that very sharp and

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.560 
something and keep that very sharp and
blur<00:07:09.710> the<00:07:09.740> background<00:07:09.979> but<00:07:10.550> you<00:07:10.789> get<00:07:10.970> a<00:07:11.000> big

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
blur the background but you get a big

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.350 
blur the background but you get a big
amount<00:07:11.930> of<00:07:12.080> background<00:07:12.289> with<00:07:12.889> that<00:07:13.039> so<00:07:13.360> that's

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
amount of background with that so that's

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.990 
amount of background with that so that's
really<00:07:14.479> a<00:07:14.740> much<00:07:15.740> better<00:07:16.009> lens<00:07:16.400> but<00:07:16.729> is<00:07:16.849> it

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
really a much better lens but is it

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.810 
really a much better lens but is it
$1,000<00:07:17.960> better<00:07:18.259> it<00:07:19.009> depends<00:07:19.400> on<00:07:19.460> your<00:07:19.610> usage

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
$1,000 better it depends on your usage

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.909 
$1,000 better it depends on your usage
if<00:07:20.240> you're<00:07:20.419> making<00:07:20.900> money<00:07:21.259> from<00:07:21.710> your
