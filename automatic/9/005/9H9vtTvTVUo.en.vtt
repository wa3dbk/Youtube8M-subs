compared to like when I did pluck in
Mario<00:04:45.250> it's<00:04:45.550> like<00:04:45.820> there's<00:04:46.600> key<00:04:47.050> differences

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560

in<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.770> gameplay<00:04:48.220> style<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
in the gameplay style and in the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.840 
in the gameplay style and in the
mechanics<00:04:49.720> as<00:04:49.960> opposed<00:04:50.890> like<00:04:51.160> megaman<00:04:51.490> where

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
mechanics as opposed like megaman where

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.030 
mechanics as opposed like megaman where
there's<00:04:52.270> not<00:04:52.570> really<00:04:52.960> which<00:04:53.740> doesn't<00:04:54.010> mean

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
there's not really which doesn't mean
