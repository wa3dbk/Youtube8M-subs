ground<00:01:25.570> ball<00:01:25.750> z<00:01:25.930> budokai<00:01:26.140> um<00:01:27.040> this<00:01:28.030> is<00:01:28.180> the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
ground ball z budokai um this is the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.790 
ground ball z budokai um this is the
second<00:01:28.960> game<00:01:29.110> I<00:01:29.170> had<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:32.020> good<00:01:32.260> game

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
second game I had it's a good game

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160 
second game I had it's a good game
but<00:01:32.980> I<00:01:33.280> would<00:01:34.060> not<00:01:34.210> recommend<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.810> cuz<00:01:35.050> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
but I would not recommend it cuz the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.210 
but I would not recommend it cuz the
graphics<00:01:35.740> suck<00:01:36.010> kind<00:01:36.370> of<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.320> gameplay<00:01:38.950> I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
graphics suck kind of and the gameplay I

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.100 
graphics suck kind of and the gameplay I
think<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.760> one<00:01:39.970> for<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> Wii<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.540> better<00:01:40.810> I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
think the one for the Wii is better I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.160 
think the one for the Wii is better I
think<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.730> never<00:01:42.790> played<00:01:43.480> it<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:43.840> it

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
think because I never played it so it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.100 
think because I never played it so it
doesn't<00:01:44.470> matter<00:01:44.590> um<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:46.090> yeah<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.690> would<00:01:46.930> not

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
doesn't matter um so yeah I would not

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.040 
doesn't matter um so yeah I would not
recommend<00:01:47.410> this<00:01:47.680> unless<00:01:48.540> you're<00:01:49.540> into<00:01:49.750> dragon

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050
