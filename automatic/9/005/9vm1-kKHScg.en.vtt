00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
already threaded because they were

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.889 
already threaded because they were
holding<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.969> engine<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.660> place

with the existing studing but the
original<00:00:42.360> saloon<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.260> damaged<00:00:43.649> hence

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
original saloon was a bit damaged hence

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.310 
original saloon was a bit damaged hence
the<00:00:44.430> idea<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:45.030> using<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.629> new<00:00:45.809> stuff<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the idea of using some new stuff I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.459 
the idea of using some new stuff I
normally<00:00:47.219> fit<00:00:47.460> studs<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.300> using<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.260> pair

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
normally fit studs this way using a pair

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.100 
normally fit studs this way using a pair
of<00:00:49.500> lock<00:00:49.800> nuts<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> socket<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
of lock nuts and then use a socket to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.860 
of lock nuts and then use a socket to
just<00:00:52.289> screw<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.770> into<00:00:52.890> place<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> first

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
just screw them into place on the first

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
just screw them into place on the first
one<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.860> checking<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> right

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
one I'm just checking that is the right

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
one I'm just checking that is the right
length<00:00:57.360> by<00:00:57.719> offering<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.289> engine<00:00:58.620> casting<00:00:59.010> up

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
length by offering the engine casting up

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
length by offering the engine casting up
against<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> yes<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> looks<00:01:00.270> okay<00:01:02.809> once<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
against it and yes it looks okay once I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
against it and yes it looks okay once I
get<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> length<00:01:04.409> right<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> first<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
get the length right for the first one I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.510 
get the length right for the first one I
just<00:01:06.030> duplicate<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> rest<00:01:07.520> though

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
just duplicate it on the rest though

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.219 
just duplicate it on the rest though
once<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> stood<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.210> screwed<00:01:09.479> into<00:01:09.659> position

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
once the stood is screwed into position

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
once the stood is screwed into position
all<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> couple<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
all you have to do is use a couple of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
all you have to do is use a couple of
small<00:01:12.510> spanners<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.590> release<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> lock<00:01:14.250> nuts

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
small spanners to release the lock nuts

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.840 
small spanners to release the lock nuts
which<00:01:15.150> will<00:01:15.330> come<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.630> easily<00:01:16.640> once<00:01:17.640> all

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
which will come off very easily once all

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
which will come off very easily once all
the<00:01:18.000> studs<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.420> fitted<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> fit

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the studs are fitted it is time to fit

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
the studs are fitted it is time to fit
the<00:01:20.040> first<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> engine<00:01:20.880> castings<00:01:21.560> I'm

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the first of the engine castings I'm

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
the first of the engine castings I'm
using<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.979> soft<00:01:23.250> hammer<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.180> tap<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
using a soft hammer to just tap it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.510 
using a soft hammer to just tap it
firmly<00:01:24.840> into<00:01:25.080> place

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
firmly into place

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
firmly into place
before<00:01:26.520> tightening<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> nuts<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
before tightening up all the nuts with a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
before tightening up all the nuts with a
small<00:01:28.500> spanner<00:01:28.850> where<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> possible<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
small spanner where is possible to use a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
small spanner where is possible to use a
socket<00:01:31.140> driver<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.860> use<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> socket<00:01:32.610> driver

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
socket driver I use a socket driver

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
socket driver I use a socket driver
because<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.720> quicker<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
because it's much quicker but there are

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
because it's much quicker but there are
certain<00:01:35.009> places<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.520> models<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.479> where

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
certain places on models like here where

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
certain places on models like here where
a<00:01:36.780> socket<00:01:37.200> driver<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.650> map<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> paint<00:01:38.310> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
a socket driver would map the paint but

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
a socket driver would map the paint but
here<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.420> socket<00:01:39.780> driver<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> okay<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.740> you're

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
here the socket driver is okay if you're

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.380 
here the socket driver is okay if you're
doing<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.250> job<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.180> worth

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
doing a job like this it's worth

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
is in the end was a rethreaded it and

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.259 
is in the end was a rethreaded it and
put<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> 6<00:03:27.900> ba<00:03:28.140> bolt<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.680> there<00:03:29.120> slightly<00:03:30.120> more

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
put a 6 ba bolt in there slightly more

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.120 
put a 6 ba bolt in there slightly more
substantial<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:31.200> only<00:03:31.500> slightly

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
substantial but only slightly

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.280 
substantial but only slightly
a<00:03:32.280> quick<00:03:33.030> check<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.299> make<00:03:33.569> sure<00:03:33.630> nothing<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
a quick check to make sure nothing the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.289 
a quick check to make sure nothing the
binding<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.829> yes<00:03:35.400> everything<00:03:35.880> seems<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> be

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
binding and yes everything seems to be

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.970 
binding and yes everything seems to be
okay<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:39.390> it's<00:03:39.720> time<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.140> fit<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.500> valve<00:03:40.739> gear

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
okay so it's time to fit the valve gear

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.099 
okay so it's time to fit the valve gear
and<00:03:41.639> one<00:03:41.880> side<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.359> valve<00:03:42.569> gear<00:03:42.810> also

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
and one side of the valve gear also

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.319 
and one side of the valve gear also
operates<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.889> water<00:03:44.130> pump<00:03:44.489> which<00:03:44.730> once<00:03:45.030> again

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
operates the water pump which once again

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.379 
operates the water pump which once again
I<00:03:45.540> think<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.290> not<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> good<00:03:46.799> idea<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:47.910> Who<00:03:48.120> am<00:03:48.269> I

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
I think is not a good idea but Who am I

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.319 
I think is not a good idea but Who am I
to<00:03:48.450> question<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.639> here<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.910> together

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
to question this here it is together

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.539 
to question this here it is together
what<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.840> did<00:03:52.109> next<00:03:52.319> was<00:03:52.440> fit<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.980> cylinder<00:03:53.400> end

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
what I did next was fit the cylinder end

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.759 
what I did next was fit the cylinder end
covers<00:03:53.910> temporarily<00:03:54.450> fit<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.500> inlet

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
covers temporarily fit the inlet

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.620 
covers temporarily fit the inlet
manifold<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.489> put<00:03:56.609> some<00:03:56.790> compressed<00:03:57.239> air<00:03:57.420> in

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
manifold and put some compressed air in

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.819 
manifold and put some compressed air in
to<00:03:57.930> see<00:03:58.109> how<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.350> runs

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
to see how it runs

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.770 
to see how it runs
and<00:03:59.400> I'm<00:03:59.549> really<00:03:59.790> not<00:04:00.000> thrilled<00:04:00.359> with<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.630> it

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and I'm really not thrilled with it it

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.420 
and I'm really not thrilled with it it
sounds<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.170> little<00:04:01.260> bit<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.739> pneumatic

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
sounds a little bit like a pneumatic

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.400 
sounds a little bit like a pneumatic
drill<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.450> thought<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.810> was<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.260> do

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
drill and I thought it was going to do

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.160 
drill and I thought it was going to do
this<00:04:04.880> all<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.180> problems<00:04:06.600> with<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:06.959> engine

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
this all the problems with this engine

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.259 
this all the problems with this engine
had<00:04:07.739> do<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.370> crankshaft

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
had do to the crankshaft

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.240 
had do to the crankshaft
I<00:04:09.299> always<00:04:10.049> like<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.319> steam<00:04:10.560> engines<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.100> I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
I always like the steam engines that I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.610 
I always like the steam engines that I
work<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:12.000> run<00:04:12.209> very<00:04:12.480> well<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:13.019> run<00:04:13.380> very

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
work on to run very well and run very

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.229 
work on to run very well and run very
well<00:04:13.829> for<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.069> long<00:04:14.190> period<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.700> time

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
well for a long period of time

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.479 
well for a long period of time
I<00:04:15.289> really<00:04:16.289> cannot<00:04:16.590> give<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.950> back<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.220> my

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
I really cannot give this back to my

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.159 
I really cannot give this back to my
friend<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:17.970> say<00:04:18.150> there<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.690> go<00:04:18.870> enjoy

friend and say there you go enjoy

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.469 
friend and say there you go enjoy
playing<00:04:20.070> with<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.430> because<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.090> first<00:04:21.330> time

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
playing with it because the first time

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.390 
playing with it because the first time
you<00:04:21.630> put<00:04:21.750> any<00:04:22.019> pressure<00:04:22.289> on<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.620> everything

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
you put any pressure on it everything

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.629 
you put any pressure on it everything
slips

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639

7ba<00:04:26.639> bolts<00:04:27.120> are<00:04:27.240> just<00:04:27.450> not<00:04:27.690> enough<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.740> hold

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
7ba bolts are just not enough to hold

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
the crankshaft either so what I'm going

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.629 
the crankshaft either so what I'm going
to<00:04:39.600> do<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.990> temporarily<00:04:40.560> put<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.460> one

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
to do is temporarily put this on one

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.820 
to do is temporarily put this on one
side<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.330> move<00:04:42.570> on<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.870> another<00:04:43.050> project<00:04:43.350> and

side and move on to another project and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.580 
side and move on to another project and
I<00:04:44.250> will<00:04:44.310> revisit<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.240> I'm<00:04:46.230> going<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
I will revisit this I'm going to

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.680 
I will revisit this I'm going to
completely<00:04:47.070> make<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.430> new<00:04:47.820> crankshaft<00:04:48.450> and

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
completely make a new crankshaft and

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.200 
completely make a new crankshaft and
make<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.440> strong<00:04:49.740> thanks<00:04:50.669> for<00:04:50.760> watching<00:04:51.090> this

make it strong thanks for watching this

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.820 
make it strong thanks for watching this
short<00:04:51.270> series<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.169> hope<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.500> found<00:04:52.650> it
