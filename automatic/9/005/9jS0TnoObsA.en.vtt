and a painting course and life drawing

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
and a painting course and life drawing
was<00:01:40.530> part<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> graphic<00:01:41.130> design<00:01:41.460> course

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
was part of the graphic design course

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.190 
was part of the graphic design course
and<00:01:41.970> part<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> illustration<00:01:42.840> course<00:01:43.020> but

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and part of the illustration course but

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.580 
and part of the illustration course but
not<00:01:43.500> part<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> final<00:01:44.280> rise<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:46.380> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
not part of the final rise so with that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
not part of the final rise so with that
sort<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.280> focus<00:01:47.670> i<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.090> gone<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> lot

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
sort that focus i think has gone a lot

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.020 
sort that focus i think has gone a lot
from<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:48.930> arts<00:01:49.200> education<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.520> idea<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
from some arts education the idea that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
from some arts education the idea that
you<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> skill<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:53.369> pat

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you would get the skill that's down pat

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.639 
you would get the skill that's down pat
really<00:01:54.299> sort<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.630> fantastic<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> everything

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
really sort of fantastic and everything

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.840 
really sort of fantastic and everything
and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.250> break<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> rules<00:01:56.670> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and then you can break the rules that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.090 
and then you can break the rules that
sort<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> fine<00:01:57.329> they<00:01:58.110> saw<00:01:58.380> i<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.829> most

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
sort of fine they saw i think most

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590 
sort of fine they saw i think most
higher<00:01:59.399> education<00:02:00.000> places<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
higher education places think that

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440 
higher education places think that
you've<00:02:00.719> done<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.320> GCSE<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you've done that at GCSE and you have to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.600 
you've done that at GCSE and you have to
an<00:02:03.540> extent<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.079> i<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:05.009> enough<00:02:05.219> your

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
an extent but i think not enough your

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.290 
an extent but i think not enough your
pet<00:02:05.820> yeah<00:02:06.210> painters<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> park<00:02:07.680> yes<00:02:08.300> anyway

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
pet yeah painters of the park yes anyway

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300 
pet yeah painters of the park yes anyway
I<00:02:09.330> don't<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.899> pictures<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.679> well

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
I don't see you pictures now so well

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.010 
I don't see you pictures now so well
it's<00:02:11.459> not<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.849> silly<00:02:12.120> i<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.270> i<00:02:12.420> mean<00:02:12.870> i<00:02:12.959> think

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it's not so silly i know i mean i think

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.070 
it's not so silly i know i mean i think
this<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.830> incredibly<00:02:14.340> complex<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.360> so

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
this is incredibly complex and so

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.479 
this is incredibly complex and so
there's<00:02:16.319> weird<00:02:16.560> things<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.190> little

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
there's weird things going on little

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.910 
there's weird things going on little
brain<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.300> people<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:18.959> coming<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.650> just

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
brain and people are coming up and just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.490 
brain and people are coming up and just
spouting<00:02:20.340> ideas<00:02:20.730> are<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.780> you're<00:02:21.930> trying

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
spouting ideas are you and you're trying

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820 
spouting ideas are you and you're trying
to<00:02:22.620> fit<00:02:22.830> them<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.069> in<00:02:23.129> your<00:02:23.610> kind<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.830> growing

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
to fit them all in your kind of growing

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.460 
to fit them all in your kind of growing
a<00:02:25.890> story<00:02:26.160> as<00:02:26.310> you're<00:02:26.459> going<00:02:26.610> along<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:28.290> it

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
a story as you're going along is it

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.229 
a story as you're going along is it
storytelling<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.099> or<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.760> yeah<00:02:30.030> it's

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239

storytelling this or is it yeah it's
partly<00:02:30.629> storytelling<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:32.550> it's<00:02:32.700> difficult

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
partly storytelling but it's difficult

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.369 
partly storytelling but it's difficult
cuz<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.480> not<00:02:33.510> your<00:02:33.750> story<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.290> you're

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379

cuz it's not your story that you're
telling<00:02:34.470> us<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.920> logical<00:02:35.310> some<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.879> don't

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
telling us a logical some and you don't

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.520 
telling us a logical some and you don't
know<00:02:36.180> where<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> story<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.720> going<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.319> don't

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
know where the story is going you don't

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.970 
know where the story is going you don't
know<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.769> end<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.370> don't<00:02:38.519> know<00:02:39.980> but

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
know what the end is you don't know but

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.720 
know what the end is you don't know but
uh<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.580> uh<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:42.060> silver<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.500> difficult<00:02:44.129> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
uh but uh I silver it's a difficult of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.780 
uh but uh I silver it's a difficult of
multitasking<00:02:45.410> skill<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.680> sort<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.950> listen<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
multitasking skill to sort of listen and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.970 
multitasking skill to sort of listen and
draw<00:02:48.060> yeah<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.900> turn<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.349> into<00:02:49.410> some<00:02:49.769> sort

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
draw yeah and turn that into some sort

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.199 
draw yeah and turn that into some sort
of<00:02:50.099> image<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.300> well<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:53.790> hard<00:02:54.060> today
