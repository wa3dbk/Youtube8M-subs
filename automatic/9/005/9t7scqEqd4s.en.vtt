00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good guys in this new video os 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.730
 I'm going to make the best application out there 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.309
 to maintain security in our 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 smartphone and lock different settings 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.769
 so if you want to know you already know 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.769
 what you have to do 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.340
 but guys before I start I want 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.200
 say that this video also I do in 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.300
 part in response some comments 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.070
 that you put a previous video not to 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.840
 the video was not called increase 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.710
 security or something ballet if you do not 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.599
 you have seen well then also 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.400
 I'll stop by here so you know 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.170
 what is in this video showed a 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.900
 application that was pretty good the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.300
 which allowed them to block applications 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.730
 and some of you put comments on 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.340
 type uninstall the application and so on and 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.809
 well I would mostly use these 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.730
 applications or I would give them the most use 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.800
 oriented for example to everyday use 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.420
 that prevent our children from accessing 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.760
 to certain applications or from carson to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.710
 some friend and obviously if in this 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.470
 event in these cases because it will not catch 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.449
 the friend and is going to put to uninstall 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.040
 the application but partly because 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.840
 He was right if we were going to look for the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.420
 tickle this application as the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.950
 you can uninstall and point in this new 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 video I will show another application that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.299
 it's pretty much quite complete and 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.549
 would allow us the ability to activate 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.740
 the option that can not be uninstalled 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.750
 this application this application is called 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.460
 ex lock and below the description to see is 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.229
 the link to download it completely 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.740
 free let's put the pattern that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.320
 we 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.180
 predefined when entering for the first time 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.610
 this application and how are you seeing that 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.009
 we have a simple interface 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.750
 and from the most basic we can go 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.789
 moving between the different profiles 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.979
 that we create for example this 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.990
 default profile would be the one or not 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.670
 I would have absolutely nothing would not block 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.369
 nothing and then here we have for example 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.110
 work word and house us 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.539
 simply by touching one of the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.670
 profiles we would activate it and to be able 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.619
 adjust all the applications that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.509
 we want to block others simply 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.610
 we take the bottom part and activate 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.530
 all those that we want 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 block once we have already 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.940
 blocked then we can go out and let's go 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.140
 check if it really works to access 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.239
 to youtube which is one of the ones I have 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 blocked and would ask us the pattern to 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.069
 to be able to access everything here all the same 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.780
 simple everything very easy to go back to 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.670
 access the application and some 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.540
 applications allows you to create all 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.940
 profiles that we want 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.440
 simply giving here the more they 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.330
 we could add the profiles that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.640
 we want for example here parental party 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.989
 school coffee simply because they would be 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.510
 some names that have given then for 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.280
 create other profiles, but these are 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.569
 names really do not matter 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.890
 since good and then for example here 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.420
 we give the pen gives us the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.910
 possibility to change the name and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.290
 change the icon and delete it and 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.700
 well let's go see the adjustments 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.170
 of the simpler now 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.670
 interesting and what to what I 've done 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.350
 reference to the beginning of the video we're going 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 here to adjustments we have different 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.250
 pretty interesting options for 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.050
 example the type of code for example 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.850
 I have defined it to be a pattern but 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.350
 we want to put a code then 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.690
 now we will have the possibility of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.400
 put an end to it in this case then 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 it takes to meet my employer here 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.209
 would be the option that I have mentioned 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.310
 an install prevention ' simply in 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.709
 other sides here in activate we would avoid 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 that the application was of is installed 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.620
 and that way if someone wants 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.720
 install the application previously 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.150
 you must enter the pattern that we 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.310
 we have predefined sets the option to 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 enable auto active will allow us to 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.670
 for example we come home and 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.920
 we turn on the wifi because for example it 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.750
 activate the house profile and finally the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.340
 third option would be notify to love new 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.989
 apps this option what will we do 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.260
 is that when we download a 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.550
 default application we block it like this 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.690
 what good guys the application either 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.610
 I would have much more truth that has 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.470
 delighted by the interface so simple and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.160
 intuitive and nice that you have because 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.720
 boiling sample 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.250
 quite friendly and what I have 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.170
 commented at the beginning and it goes up a 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 video about another application but as 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.160
 it has appeared better and I have found 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.510
 I have the option that he told me in 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.760
 the previous video as I have decided 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.020
 share it with all of you so 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.910
 nothing more guys now let's leave 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.010
 two other videos quite interesting and 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.840
 related to the channel and that I've only 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.840
 seen we recommend that you pass
