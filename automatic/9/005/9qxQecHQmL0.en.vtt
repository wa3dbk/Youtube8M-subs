00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.090 

alright<00:00:06.080> last<00:00:06.319> week<00:00:06.500> when<00:00:06.649> i<00:00:06.710> went<00:00:06.890> to<00:00:06.920> light

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
alright last week when i went to light

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.140 
alright last week when i went to light
my<00:00:07.279> hydroxy<00:00:08.149> barbecue<00:00:08.629> that<00:00:08.780> i'm<00:00:08.930> making

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
my hydroxy barbecue that i'm making

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.100 
my hydroxy barbecue that i'm making
everything<00:00:11.150> was<00:00:11.360> working<00:00:11.570> good<00:00:11.809> then<00:00:12.020> I

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
everything was working good then I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.320 
everything was working good then I
looked<00:00:12.320> over<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:12.620> I<00:00:12.800> noticed<00:00:13.190> foam<00:00:13.519> for<00:00:14.240> the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
looked over and I noticed foam for the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.060 
looked over and I noticed foam for the
first<00:00:14.630> time<00:00:14.900> in<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:15.200> couple<00:00:15.500> of<00:00:15.559> months<00:00:15.740> foam

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
first time in a couple of months foam

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.480 
first time in a couple of months foam
had<00:00:16.340> started<00:00:16.849> shooting<00:00:17.270> out<00:00:17.390> these<00:00:17.599> hoses<00:00:18.490> and

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
had started shooting out these hoses and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.330 
had started shooting out these hoses and
start<00:00:19.939> coming<00:00:20.270> out<00:00:20.360> my<00:00:20.630> hose<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.800> coming<00:00:22.160> down

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
start coming out my hose and coming down

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.210 
start coming out my hose and coming down
so<00:00:22.699> I<00:00:22.730> had<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:22.970> turn<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:23.210> off<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:23.480> I<00:00:24.100> went<00:00:25.100> and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
so I had to turn it off so I went and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.650 
so I had to turn it off so I went and
reached<00:00:25.400> for<00:00:25.580> my<00:00:25.789> phone<00:00:25.820> for<00:00:26.269> you<00:00:26.390> which<00:00:26.539> I

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
reached for my phone for you which I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.759 
reached for my phone for you which I
haven't<00:00:26.900> used<00:00:27.019> in<00:00:27.199> a<00:00:27.260> couple<00:00:27.560> of<00:00:27.619> months

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
haven't used in a couple of months

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.370 
haven't used in a couple of months
because<00:00:28.310> i<00:00:28.369> haven't<00:00:28.519> had<00:00:28.730> to<00:00:28.939> but<00:00:29.210> just<00:00:30.170> as<00:00:30.289> I

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
because i haven't had to but just as I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.929 
because i haven't had to but just as I
want<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:30.679> reach<00:00:30.859> for<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:31.340> remembered

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
want to reach for it I remembered

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.869 
want to reach for it I remembered
somebody<00:00:32.599> sending<00:00:32.900> me<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.019> video<00:00:33.580> where<00:00:34.580> a<00:00:34.610> guy

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
somebody sending me a video where a guy

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.110 
somebody sending me a video where a guy
had<00:00:35.570> figured<00:00:35.870> out<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:37.220> if<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.460> put<00:00:37.670> cutoff

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
had figured out that if you put cutoff

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.810 
had figured out that if you put cutoff
valves<00:00:38.659> in<00:00:38.839> line<00:00:39.470> with<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.860> water<00:00:40.100> line<00:00:40.549> that

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
valves in line with the water line that

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.990 
valves in line with the water line that
feeds<00:00:41.089> the<00:00:41.299> dry<00:00:41.510> cell<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:43.070> slowly<00:00:43.400> choked

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
feeds the dry cell and you slowly choked

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.590 
feeds the dry cell and you slowly choked
off<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.839> water<00:00:45.140> flow<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.640> restricts<00:00:47.510> how

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
off the water flow so that restricts how

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.119 
off the water flow so that restricts how
much<00:00:47.750> water<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.110> going<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.320> your<00:00:48.470> dry<00:00:48.650> cell<00:00:48.920> and

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
much water is going to your dry cell and

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.490 
much water is going to your dry cell and
have<00:00:49.339> an<00:00:49.460> amp<00:00:49.699> probe<00:00:50.000> clamp-on<00:00:50.720> ammeter<00:00:51.080> like

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
have an amp probe clamp-on ammeter like

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.369 
have an amp probe clamp-on ammeter like
that<00:00:52.330> touchdown<00:00:53.330> you'll<00:00:53.510> notice<00:00:53.900> as<00:00:54.110> you're

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
that touchdown you'll notice as you're

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.930 
that touchdown you'll notice as you're
turning<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.799> slowly<00:00:55.129> they're<00:00:55.430> going<00:00:55.729> to<00:00:55.790> hit<00:00:55.879> a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
turning it slowly they're going to hit a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.960 
turning it slowly they're going to hit a
spot<00:00:56.239> where<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.659> amperage<00:00:57.049> increases<00:00:57.680> and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
spot where the amperage increases and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.399 
spot where the amperage increases and
then<00:00:58.970> once<00:00:59.330> you<00:00:59.449> turn<00:00:59.659> it<00:00:59.780> just<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.140> little<00:01:00.170> bit

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
then once you turn it just a little bit

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.350 
then once you turn it just a little bit
past<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.920> you'll<00:01:01.339> see<00:01:01.549> it'll<00:01:01.670> decrease

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
past that you'll see it'll decrease

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.520 
past that you'll see it'll decrease
again<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.900> want<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:03.110> leave<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:03.379> right

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
again so you want to leave it right

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.160 
again so you want to leave it right
where<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.830> amperage<00:01:04.129> goes<00:01:04.369> up<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.080> for<00:01:06.080> this

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
where the amperage goes up and for this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.890 
where the amperage goes up and for this
guy<00:01:06.409> anyway<00:01:06.710> when<00:01:06.950> he<00:01:07.100> did<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.750> when<00:01:08.750> he<00:01:08.780> was

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
guy anyway when he did that when he was

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.890 
guy anyway when he did that when he was
choking<00:01:09.260> off<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:10.250> Dry<00:01:10.670> cells<00:01:10.780> he<00:01:11.780> was

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
choking off the the Dry cells he was

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.210 
choking off the the Dry cells he was
actually<00:01:12.200> able<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.410> get<00:01:12.590> rid<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.800> his<00:01:12.980> phone

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
actually able to get rid of his phone

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.400 
actually able to get rid of his phone
and<00:01:13.520> he<00:01:14.240> increased<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.870> amperage<00:01:15.230> in

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
and he increased the amperage in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.630 
and he increased the amperage in
production<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.920> little<00:01:16.130> bit<00:01:16.250> just<00:01:16.400> by<00:01:16.580> doing

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
production a little bit just by doing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.720 
production a little bit just by doing
that<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.920> decided<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.430> was<00:01:19.550> going<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
that so I just decided I was going to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.670 
that so I just decided I was going to
try<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.150> before<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:20.600> jump<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.200> foam<00:01:21.410> free

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
try that before I jump to the foam free

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.940 
try that before I jump to the foam free
and<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.820> installed<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.600> cut<00:01:24.470> off<00:01:24.620> valves

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
and I installed the to cut off valves

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.230 
and I installed the to cut off valves
over<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.220> weekend<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:25.880> when<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.060> was

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
over the weekend and when I was

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.400 
over the weekend and when I was
fine-tuning<00:01:26.510> it<00:01:27.020> yesterday<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.860> noticed<00:01:29.410> it

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
fine-tuning it yesterday I noticed it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.590 
fine-tuning it yesterday I noticed it
does<00:01:30.710> increase<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.220> amperage<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:32.360> does

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
does increase the amperage it does

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.990 
does increase the amperage it does
increase<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.140> production<00:01:33.530> yes<00:01:34.010> slightly<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
increase the production yes slightly a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.149 
increase the production yes slightly a
game<00:01:35.300> like<00:01:35.540> maybe<00:01:35.870> another<00:01:36.170> eight

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
game like maybe another eight

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.970 
game like maybe another eight
milliliters<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:38.030> gas<00:01:38.450> very<00:01:39.380> very<00:01:39.560> hard<00:01:39.830> to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
milliliters of gas very very hard to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.590 
milliliters of gas very very hard to
measure<00:01:40.159> but<00:01:40.460> there<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> slight<00:01:41.540> increase

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
measure but there is a slight increase

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.780 
measure but there is a slight increase
you<00:01:42.530> probably<00:01:42.770> notice<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.250> more<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:43.610> higher

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
you probably notice it more on higher

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.170 
you probably notice it more on higher
productions<00:01:44.480> but<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:46.400> one<00:01:46.550> thing<00:01:46.730> it<00:01:46.880> didn't

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
productions but the one thing it didn't

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.390 
productions but the one thing it didn't
do<00:01:47.270> for<00:01:47.510> me<00:01:47.659> was<00:01:47.870> stopped<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.440> foam<00:01:48.650> yeah<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
do for me was stopped the foam yeah the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.060 
do for me was stopped the foam yeah the
foam<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:49.850> continued<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.300> go<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.650> went<00:01:51.979> back

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
dry cell works it may work but it did

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.200 
dry cell works it may work but it did
not<00:02:02.840> work<00:02:03.049> for<00:02:03.470> me<00:02:03.530> what<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.520> did<00:02:04.700> do<00:02:04.880> was

not work for me what it did do was
increase<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.409> flow<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.690> amperage<00:02:09.170> that

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
increase the flow and the amperage that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.559 
increase the flow and the amperage that
these<00:02:09.679> help<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.220> went<00:02:10.399> from<00:02:10.580> let's<00:02:11.420> say

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
these help was it went from let's say

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.120 
these help was it went from let's say
the<00:02:11.690> diamond<00:02:12.080> cell<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:12.470> which<00:02:12.620> was<00:02:12.770> at<00:02:12.920> about

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the diamond cell here which was at about

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.580 
the diamond cell here which was at about
18<00:02:13.459> amps<00:02:13.760> went<00:02:14.030> up<00:02:14.120> both<00:02:14.510> three<00:02:14.900> amps<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> about

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
18 amps went up both three amps to about

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
18 amps went up both three amps to about
21<00:02:15.980> amps

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
21 amps

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.009 
21 amps
this<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:17.849> at<00:02:18.000> 8<00:02:18.209> amps<00:02:18.450> went<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
this one that was at 8 amps went to a

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.649 
this one that was at 8 amps went to a
boat<00:02:19.290> 11<00:02:19.769> amps<00:02:20.099> by<00:02:20.280> choking<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.790> off<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.569> I

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
boat 11 amps by choking it off and I

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.390 
boat 11 amps by choking it off and I
don't<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:21.989> much<00:02:22.290> production<00:02:22.739> actually<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.370> I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
don't see much production actually so I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.640 
don't see much production actually so I
don't<00:02:23.549> even<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.760> there's<00:02:24.720> much<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.200> gain

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
don't even think there's much of a gain

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.880 
don't even think there's much of a gain
and<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.980> anyway<00:02:26.750> alright<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.470> choke<00:02:28.709> off

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and it anyway alright so the choke off

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.130 
and it anyway alright so the choke off
valves<00:02:29.310> are<00:02:29.430> good<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:29.879> adding<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.689> little<00:02:30.989> bit

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
valves are good for adding a little bit

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.899 
valves are good for adding a little bit
more<00:02:31.349> production<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.189> about<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.579> though<00:02:32.730> I

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
more production that's about it though I

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.580 
more production that's about it though I
didn't<00:02:33.239> find<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.569> did<00:02:33.750> much<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.200> foaming

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
didn't find it did much for the foaming

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
didn't find it did much for the foaming
but<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:36.109> did<00:02:37.109> put<00:02:37.379> my<00:02:38.040> phone<00:02:38.430> free<00:02:38.939> in<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:39.420> as

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
but I did put my phone free in there as

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.449 
but I did put my phone free in there as
soon<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.230> started<00:02:40.530> foaming<00:02:40.739> again<00:02:41.220> and

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
soon as it started foaming again and

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.149 
soon as it started foaming again and
about<00:02:42.329> two<00:02:42.930> seconds<00:02:43.319> later<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:43.769> was<00:02:43.920> no

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
about two seconds later there was no

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.039 
about two seconds later there was no

I'll turn it on right now without even

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.210 
I'll turn it on right now without even
stopping<00:02:50.639> the<00:02:50.970> camera<00:02:51.889> just<00:02:52.889> so<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.159> could

right<00:03:49.330> at<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.600> McDevitt<00:03:50.080> doesn't<00:03:50.320> even<00:03:50.440> flash

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
right at the McDevitt doesn't even flash

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.610 
right at the McDevitt doesn't even flash
to<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:50.950> back<00:03:51.190> flame<00:03:51.430> arrestor<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.660> as<00:03:52.960> long<00:03:53.530> as

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
to the back flame arrestor so as long as

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.260 
to the back flame arrestor so as long as
you<00:03:53.770> got<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.920> small<00:03:54.250> tip<00:03:54.490> like<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.700> point<00:03:55.000> zero

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
you got a small tip like a point zero

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.360 
you got a small tip like a point zero
two<00:03:55.300> three<00:03:55.720> like<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.020> got<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.920> should<00:03:57.100> have<00:03:57.220> no

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
two three like I got you should have no

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
two three like I got you should have no

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
using the standard ones are a little

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.770 
using the standard ones are a little
smaller<00:04:11.830> but<00:04:12.150> just<00:04:13.150> go<00:04:13.270> to<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.390> welding<00:04:13.750> shop

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
smaller but just go to a welding shop

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.350 
smaller but just go to a welding shop
and<00:04:14.170> ask<00:04:14.290> for<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.590> miller<00:04:14.860> big<00:04:15.730> tips<00:04:16.000> and

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
and ask for the miller big tips and

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.810 
and ask for the miller big tips and
those<00:04:16.600> are<00:04:16.630> much<00:04:16.989> much<00:04:17.860> better<00:04:18.100> quality<00:04:18.670> and

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
those are much much better quality and

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.810 
those are much much better quality and
they're<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.120> bigger<00:04:19.650> anyway<00:04:20.650> just<00:04:21.580> want

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
they're a little bigger anyway just want

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.180 
they're a little bigger anyway just want
to<00:04:21.910> let<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.150> know<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.980> alright<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.130> i

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
to let you know that alright so i

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.740 
to let you know that alright so i
decided<00:04:24.520> i<00:04:24.640> wanted<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:24.970> try<00:04:25.150> boiling<00:04:25.420> some

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
decided i wanted to try boiling some

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.750 
decided i wanted to try boiling some
water<00:04:25.780> again<00:04:26.260> but<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.530> time<00:04:26.590> want<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.100> use<00:04:27.430> a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
water again but this time want to use a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.150 
water again but this time want to use a
big<00:04:28.030> flat<00:04:28.600> circular<00:04:28.930> piece<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.590> metal<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.010> i

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
big flat circular piece of metal that i

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.950 
big flat circular piece of metal that i
had<00:04:30.400> hoping<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.240> heat<00:04:31.450> will<00:04:31.630> distribute

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
had hoping that the heat will distribute

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.680 
had hoping that the heat will distribute
evenly<00:04:32.230> around<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.250> you'll<00:04:34.240> see<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.480> i

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
evenly around it and you'll see that i

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.000 
evenly around it and you'll see that i
don't<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:34.960> much<00:04:35.110> patience<00:04:35.530> with<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:35.950> it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
don't have much patience with it and it

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.070 
don't have much patience with it and it
turns<00:04:36.220> into<00:04:36.370> an<00:04:36.640> experiment<00:04:37.240> where<00:04:37.450> we<00:04:37.750> can

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
turns into an experiment where we can

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.570 
turns into an experiment where we can
see<00:04:38.200> how<00:04:38.260> chase<00:04:38.530> we<00:04:38.710> can<00:04:38.830> get<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.040> plot<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
see how chase we can get the plot to the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.230 
see how chase we can get the plot to the
flame

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.589 

there's<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.960> flame<00:04:46.000> hitting<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.120> bottom<00:04:47.479> of

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
there's the flame hitting the bottom of

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.180 
there's the flame hitting the bottom of
this<00:04:47.690> piece<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:48.110> metal<00:04:48.139> or<00:04:48.500> going<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.889> see<00:04:49.009> the

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
this piece of metal or going to see the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.920 
this piece of metal or going to see the
metal<00:04:49.520> will<00:04:49.610> transfer<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.120> heat<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:50.660> plot

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
metal will transfer the heat to the plot

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.480 
metal will transfer the heat to the plot
that's<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:55.750> all<00:04:56.750> right<00:04:57.139> it's<00:04:58.099> only<00:04:58.310> been<00:04:58.430> a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
that's it all right it's only been a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.879 
that's it all right it's only been a
minute<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.240> think<00:05:00.020> this<00:05:00.139> is<00:05:00.199> going<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.500> work<00:05:00.680> is

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
minute I think this is going to work is

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.980 
minute I think this is going to work is
when<00:05:01.069> I<00:05:01.099> touch<00:05:01.340> this<00:05:01.550> metal<00:05:01.940> it's<00:05:02.780> already

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
when I touch this metal it's already

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.900 
when I touch this metal it's already
nice<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.259> warm<00:05:03.680> it's<00:05:04.130> actually<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.699> point

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
nice and warm it's actually to the point

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.309 
nice and warm it's actually to the point
where<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.060> can't<00:05:05.150> really<00:05:05.449> leave<00:05:05.690> my<00:05:05.870> hand<00:05:06.050> on<00:05:06.259> it

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
where I can't really leave my hand on it

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.020 
where I can't really leave my hand on it
very<00:05:06.440> long<00:05:07.810> check<00:05:08.810> in<00:05:08.960> another<00:05:09.229> minute<00:05:10.030> okay

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
very long check in another minute okay

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.670 
very long check in another minute okay
so<00:05:11.120> i<00:05:11.270> took<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.569> metal<00:05:11.840> piece<00:05:11.990> off<00:05:12.259> it<00:05:12.560> was

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
so i took the metal piece off it was

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.320 
so i took the metal piece off it was
working<00:05:13.099> but<00:05:13.250> not<00:05:13.430> as<00:05:13.550> fast<00:05:13.580> as<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.090> had<00:05:14.180> wanted

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
working but not as fast as I had wanted

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.930 
working but not as fast as I had wanted
it<00:05:14.569> to<00:05:14.720> work<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.139> this<00:05:15.919> experiment<00:05:16.580> has<00:05:16.610> turned

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
it to work so this experiment has turned

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.870 
it to work so this experiment has turned
into<00:05:17.150> how<00:05:17.569> close<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:18.080> we<00:05:18.110> get<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.470> putt<00:05:18.880> to

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
into how close can we get the putt to

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.960 
into how close can we get the putt to
the<00:05:20.000> flame<00:05:20.270> without<00:05:20.750> destroying<00:05:21.319> the<00:05:21.590> putt

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
the flame without destroying the putt

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.430 
the flame without destroying the putt
it's<00:05:22.970> much<00:05:23.300> closer<00:05:23.569> than<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.020> last<00:05:24.199> video

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
it's much closer than the last video

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.520 
it's much closer than the last video
that<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.800> did<00:05:24.860> this<00:05:25.220> so<00:05:25.810> we'll<00:05:26.810> see<00:05:29.319> it's<00:05:30.319> only

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
that I did this so we'll see it's only

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.870 
that I did this so we'll see it's only
been<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.710> minute<00:05:31.069> but<00:05:31.220> I'm<00:05:31.310> getting<00:05:31.550> impatient

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
been a minute but I'm getting impatient

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.680 
been a minute but I'm getting impatient
so<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.300> want<00:05:32.569> to<00:05:32.599> check<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.169> see<00:05:33.199> oh<00:05:34.150> yeah<00:05:35.150> you

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
so I want to check and see oh yeah you

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.320 
so I want to check and see oh yeah you
got<00:05:35.840> bubbles<00:05:36.080> already<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:37.000> guess<00:05:38.000> this<00:05:38.180> is

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
got bubbles already I guess this is

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.760 
got bubbles already I guess this is
going<00:05:38.509> to<00:05:38.569> happen<00:05:38.690> faster<00:05:39.319> than<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.590> last

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
going to happen faster than the last

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.379 
going to happen faster than the last
video<00:05:40.009> because<00:05:40.490> it's<00:05:40.639> closer<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.240> flame

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
video because it's closer to the flame

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.230 
video because it's closer to the flame
and<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:42.440> don't<00:05:42.650> see<00:05:42.860> any<00:05:43.130> destruction<00:05:43.819> of<00:05:44.090> that

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
and I don't see any destruction of that

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.270 
and I don't see any destruction of that
metal<00:05:44.449> yet<00:05:45.940> this<00:05:46.940> is<00:05:47.120> actually<00:05:47.509> pretty<00:05:47.690> good

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
metal yet this is actually pretty good

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.010 
metal yet this is actually pretty good
check<00:05:49.280> in<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.550> another<00:05:49.789> minute<00:05:52.690> still<00:05:53.690> no

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
check in in another minute still no

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.959 
check in in another minute still no
destruction<00:05:54.469> of<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.860> spot<00:05:55.159> of<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.699> pot<00:05:55.940> I

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
destruction of the spot of the pot I

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.510 
destruction of the spot of the pot I
should<00:05:56.330> say<00:05:56.509> it's<00:05:57.050> been<00:05:57.229> another<00:05:57.500> minute<00:05:57.889> this

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
should say it's been another minute this

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.980 
should say it's been another minute this
almost<00:05:58.699> tells<00:05:59.030> me<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.360> i<00:05:59.389> could<00:05:59.479> get<00:05:59.719> about

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
almost tells me that i could get about

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.839 
almost tells me that i could get about
an<00:06:00.110> inch<00:06:00.289> closer<00:06:00.590> maybe<00:06:00.979> or<00:06:01.310> half<00:06:01.520> an<00:06:01.699> inch

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
an inch closer maybe or half an inch

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.760 
an inch closer maybe or half an inch
anyway<00:06:02.240> without<00:06:02.539> any<00:06:02.870> more<00:06:03.259> wrecking<00:06:03.620> we'll

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
anyway without any more wrecking we'll

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.980 
anyway without any more wrecking we'll
try<00:06:03.949> that<00:06:03.979> in<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.340> future<00:06:04.659> let's<00:06:05.659> see<00:06:05.840> where

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
try that in the future let's see where

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.070 
try that in the future let's see where
at<00:06:06.229> after<00:06:06.590> this<00:06:06.770> minute<00:06:07.159> is<00:06:07.310> passed<00:06:07.550> oh<00:06:08.180> yeah

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
at after this minute is passed oh yeah

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.740 
at after this minute is passed oh yeah
we're<00:06:09.259> just<00:06:09.289> starting<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:09.979> boil<00:06:10.250> now<00:06:10.750> next

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
we're just starting to boil now next

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.249 
we're just starting to boil now next
minute<00:06:12.050> will<00:06:12.169> definitely<00:06:12.620> be<00:06:12.740> boiling

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
minute will definitely be boiling

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.140 
minute will definitely be boiling
alright<00:06:15.259> let's<00:06:15.620> check<00:06:15.860> it<00:06:16.009> again<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.550> lot<00:06:17.120> of

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
alright let's check it again a lot of

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.029 
alright let's check it again a lot of
people<00:06:17.240> are<00:06:17.539> asking<00:06:17.900> me<00:06:18.169> why<00:06:18.469> I'm<00:06:18.740> staying

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
people are asking me why I'm staying

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.860 
people are asking me why I'm staying
with<00:06:19.219> the<00:06:19.370> one<00:06:19.520> single<00:06:19.969> burner<00:06:20.120> as<00:06:20.360> opposed<00:06:20.690> to

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
with the one single burner as opposed to

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.409 
with the one single burner as opposed to
a<00:06:20.900> bunch<00:06:21.169> for<00:06:22.009> my<00:06:22.039> barbecue<00:06:22.580> idea<00:06:22.880> that<00:06:23.270> that

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
a bunch for my barbecue idea that that

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.790 
a bunch for my barbecue idea that that
finale<00:06:23.810> there's<00:06:23.960> got<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.199> be<00:06:24.229> more<00:06:24.319> than<00:06:24.650> one

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
finale there's got to be more than one

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.309 
finale there's got to be more than one
burner<00:06:25.039> but<00:06:25.310> for<00:06:25.699> the<00:06:26.289> boiling<00:06:27.289> water

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
burner but for the boiling water

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.529 
burner but for the boiling water
application<00:06:28.280> I<00:06:28.490> want<00:06:28.819> to<00:06:28.909> exhaust<00:06:29.210> every

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
application I want to exhaust every

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.420 
application I want to exhaust every
experiment<00:06:30.259> i<00:06:30.440> can<00:06:30.680> with<00:06:30.889> just<00:06:31.099> a<00:06:31.219> single

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
experiment i can with just a single

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.999 
experiment i can with just a single
thicker<00:06:31.849> flame<00:06:32.419> like<00:06:32.690> this<00:06:32.979> to<00:06:33.979> see<00:06:34.370> if<00:06:34.490> that

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
thicker flame like this to see if that

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.070 
thicker flame like this to see if that
if<00:06:37.009> that<00:06:37.069> can<00:06:37.370> be<00:06:37.400> used<00:06:37.610> to<00:06:37.759> cook<00:06:38.330> with<00:06:38.509> more

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
if that can be used to cook with more

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.499 
if that can be used to cook with more
efficiently<00:06:39.560> than<00:06:39.650> a<00:06:40.490> bunch<00:06:40.880> of<00:06:41.030> little<00:06:41.270> tiny

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
efficiently than a bunch of little tiny

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.020 
efficiently than a bunch of little tiny
flames<00:06:41.930> i<00:06:42.199> still<00:06:43.039> have<00:06:43.190> no<00:06:43.219> idea<00:06:43.370> which<00:06:43.789> one's

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
flames i still have no idea which one's

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.430 
flames i still have no idea which one's
going<00:06:44.240> to<00:06:44.270> be<00:06:44.419> better<00:06:44.599> but<00:06:44.870> i<00:06:44.930> want<00:06:45.139> to<00:06:45.229> exhaust

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
going to be better but i want to exhaust

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.300 
going to be better but i want to exhaust
all<00:06:45.710> the<00:06:45.860> experiments<00:06:46.340> i<00:06:46.520> can<00:06:46.759> with<00:06:46.969> this

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
all the experiments i can with this

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.160 
all the experiments i can with this
flame<00:06:47.610> before<00:06:47.820> I<00:06:48.000> go<00:06:48.240> and<00:06:48.480> spread<00:06:48.750> it<00:06:48.840> out<00:06:48.990> in

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
flame before I go and spread it out in

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.740 
flame before I go and spread it out in
two<00:06:49.290> little<00:06:49.530> ones<00:06:50.000> anyway<00:06:51.000> let's<00:06:51.450> see<00:06:51.600> we're

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
two little ones anyway let's see we're

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.050 
two little ones anyway let's see we're
right<00:06:51.990> here<00:06:52.050> I<00:06:52.470> must<00:06:52.830> be<00:06:52.920> boiling<00:06:53.160> now<00:06:53.520> oh<00:06:54.140> yeah

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
right here I must be boiling now oh yeah

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.650 
right here I must be boiling now oh yeah
she's<00:06:57.060> good<00:06:58.970> alright<00:06:59.970> so<00:07:00.150> just<00:07:00.180> like<00:07:00.480> last

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
she's good alright so just like last

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.120 
she's good alright so just like last
time<00:07:00.840> we<00:07:01.110> were<00:07:01.200> able<00:07:01.320> to<00:07:01.500> boil<00:07:01.740> the<00:07:01.950> water

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
time we were able to boil the water

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.540 
time we were able to boil the water
fairly<00:07:02.670> quickly<00:07:02.910> with<00:07:03.240> hydroxy<00:07:04.170> gas<00:07:04.410> this<00:07:05.310> one

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
fairly quickly with hydroxy gas this one

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.490 
fairly quickly with hydroxy gas this one
went<00:07:05.700> probably<00:07:06.390> a<00:07:06.420> minute<00:07:06.900> or<00:07:07.020> two<00:07:07.050> quicker

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
went probably a minute or two quicker

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.390 
went probably a minute or two quicker
than<00:07:07.770> the<00:07:07.920> other<00:07:08.070> way<00:07:08.390> but<00:07:09.890> I'm<00:07:10.890> happy<00:07:11.130> with

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
than the other way but I'm happy with

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.890 
than the other way but I'm happy with
the<00:07:11.520> results<00:07:11.910> i'm<00:07:12.000> actually<00:07:12.270> going<00:07:12.540> to<00:07:12.630> put<00:07:12.780> it

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
the results i'm actually going to put it

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.540 
the results i'm actually going to put it
a<00:07:12.960> little<00:07:13.110> bit<00:07:13.290> closer<00:07:13.530> next<00:07:13.980> time<00:07:14.250> i'm<00:07:14.430> going

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
a little bit closer next time i'm going

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.210 
a little bit closer next time i'm going
to<00:07:14.670> not<00:07:15.180> do<00:07:15.330> that<00:07:15.480> today<00:07:15.720> but<00:07:15.840> next<00:07:16.320> time<00:07:16.980> I<00:07:17.100> get

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
to not do that today but next time I get

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.200 
to not do that today but next time I get
a<00:07:17.250> chance<00:07:17.310> I'm<00:07:17.670> going<00:07:17.760> to<00:07:17.850> do<00:07:17.970> the<00:07:18.060> same

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
a chance I'm going to do the same

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.320 
a chance I'm going to do the same
experiment<00:07:19.100> and<00:07:20.100> bring<00:07:20.430> the<00:07:20.580> flame<00:07:20.970> even

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
experiment and bring the flame even

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.700 
experiment and bring the flame even
closer<00:07:21.630> to<00:07:21.870> the<00:07:21.960> pot<00:07:22.170> because<00:07:22.290> there's<00:07:22.530> no

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
closer to the pot because there's no

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.920 
closer to the pot because there's no
destruction<00:07:23.130> of<00:07:23.340> the<00:07:23.400> pot<00:07:23.580> at<00:07:23.730> all<00:07:23.850> let's<00:07:24.750> take

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
destruction of the pot at all let's take

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.190 
destruction of the pot at all let's take
a<00:07:24.990> look<00:07:25.230> at<00:07:25.290> that<00:07:25.440> first<00:07:25.740> foreshadowed<00:07:26.370> uh

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
a look at that first foreshadowed uh

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.370 
a look at that first foreshadowed uh
plot<00:07:28.200> is<00:07:28.380> perfect<00:07:28.860> underneath<00:07:29.990> tons<00:07:30.990> of<00:07:31.200> steam

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
plot is perfect underneath tons of steam
