00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
why does there need to be a separate

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.490 
why does there need to be a separate
Olympics<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.850> because<00:04:37.270> people<00:04:38.110> have

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
Olympics just because people have

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.130 
Olympics just because people have

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
know I was just a bit shocked at first

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.740 
know I was just a bit shocked at first
and<00:04:44.170> i<00:04:44.200> was<00:04:44.290> fingering<00:04:44.410> myself<00:04:44.740> um<00:04:45.690> why<00:04:46.690> do

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
and i was fingering myself um why do

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.450 
and i was fingering myself um why do
people<00:04:47.170> like<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.530> segregate<00:04:47.950> themselves<00:04:48.130> to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
people like to segregate themselves to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.100 
people like to segregate themselves to
try<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.760> make<00:04:48.880> themselves<00:04:49.060> just<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.900> whole

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
try and make themselves just a whole

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.200 
try and make themselves just a whole
different<00:04:50.250> class<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.550> then<00:04:51.640> claimed<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.090> be

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
different class and then claimed to be

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.090 
different class and then claimed to be
segregated<00:04:52.780> against<00:04:53.050> reading<00:04:53.530> more<00:04:53.770> into<00:04:53.830> it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
segregated against reading more into it

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.950 
segregated against reading more into it
I<00:04:54.250> kind<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.640> found<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:55.090> it's<00:04:55.600> more<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:55.870> a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
I kind of found that it's more of a

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.030 
I kind of found that it's more of a
statement<00:04:56.170> to<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.620> countries<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.100> um<00:04:57.660> don't

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
statement to the countries that um don't
