00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hi I'm Curtis Owens from performance

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.360 
hi I'm Curtis Owens from performance
tackle<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.209> Los<00:00:03.360> Alamitos<00:00:03.840> I'm<00:00:04.589> here<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.980> show

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
tackle and Los Alamitos I'm here to show

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.190 
tackle and Los Alamitos I'm here to show
you<00:00:05.400> one<00:00:06.149> of<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.299> knots<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.810> get<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> lot<00:00:07.169> of

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
you one of the knots that I get a lot of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.560 
you one of the knots that I get a lot of
requests<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.740> how<00:00:08.100> to<00:00:08.160> tie<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:09.270> to<00:00:09.330> do

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
requests for how to tie and how to do

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.780 
requests for how to tie and how to do
it's<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.900> form<00:00:10.350> of<00:00:10.470> a<00:00:10.590> dropper<00:00:10.950> loop<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.730> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it's a form of a dropper loop it's a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.680 
it's a form of a dropper loop it's a
little<00:00:11.970> different<00:00:12.120> than<00:00:12.360> your<00:00:12.510> standard

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
little different than your standard

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.590 
little different than your standard
dropper<00:00:13.200> loop<00:00:13.350> knot<00:00:14.060> it's<00:00:15.060> kind<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
dropper loop knot it's kind of a

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.330 
dropper loop knot it's kind of a
variation<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.260> spider<00:00:16.530> hitch<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
variation of a spider hitch but it's a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.610 
variation of a spider hitch but it's a
lot<00:00:17.760> stronger<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.110> use<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.500> your

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620 
lot stronger not to use than your

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.800 
lot stronger not to use than your
standard<00:00:19.800> dropper<00:00:20.340> loop<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.780> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
standard dropper loop so I'm going to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.510 
standard dropper loop so I'm going to
show<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.440> tie<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.800> connection<00:00:23.100> so

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
show you how we tie that connection so

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.210 
show you how we tie that connection so
you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.180> dropper<00:00:24.480> loop<00:00:24.600> fishing

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
you can use it for dropper loop fishing

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.640 
you can use it for dropper loop fishing
so<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:27.030> we<00:00:27.119> go

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
so here we go

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.720 
so here we go
you're<00:00:28.650> gonna<00:00:28.740> take<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.130> piece<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you're gonna take your piece of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.749 
you're gonna take your piece of
monofilament<00:00:29.850> that<00:00:30.390> you're<00:00:30.510> using<00:00:31.579> take<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
monofilament that you're using take and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
monofilament that you're using take and
make<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.030> loop<00:00:33.210> however<00:00:33.660> large<00:00:33.900> you<00:00:34.170> think

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
make your loop however large you think

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.720 
make your loop however large you think
you're<00:00:34.500> gonna<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you're gonna want it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
you're gonna want it
some<00:00:36.090> guys<00:00:36.300> fish<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.930> short<00:00:37.140> loop<00:00:37.410> with

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
some guys fish a really short loop with

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.970 
some guys fish a really short loop with
a<00:00:37.800> long<00:00:38.070> end<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> weight<00:00:39.590> other<00:00:40.590> guys<00:00:40.770> use

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
a long end for the weight other guys use

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
a long end for the weight other guys use
a<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.670> large<00:00:41.910> loop<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.810> you

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
a really large loop it's up to you

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
a really large loop it's up to you
however<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.560> gonna<00:00:43.649> use<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> application

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
however you're gonna use the application

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
however you're gonna use the application
for<00:00:44.790> but<00:00:45.600> you're<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.260> your

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
for but you're gonna take and make your

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.540 
for but you're gonna take and make your
loop<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> line<00:00:48.410> you're<00:00:49.410> gonna<00:00:49.500> take<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
loop in the line you're gonna take the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.290 
loop in the line you're gonna take the
loop<00:00:50.790> put<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> behind<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:52.920> tag<00:00:53.160> ends<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
loop put it behind the two tag ends so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.620 
loop put it behind the two tag ends so
you've<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.950> those<00:00:55.950> behind<00:00:56.399> those<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.090> then

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
you've got those behind those and then

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.610 
you've got those behind those and then
what<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.200> is<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:58.469> your

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
what you're going to do is put your

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.490 
what you're going to do is put your
fingers<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.940> three<00:01:00.210> turns<00:01:00.450> one<00:01:00.840> two

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
fingers in and do three turns one two

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
fingers in and do three turns one two
three<00:01:02.219> rotations<00:01:02.820> you're<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.840> grab<00:01:04.140> your

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
three rotations you're gonna grab your

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340 
three rotations you're gonna grab your
loop<00:01:05.090> pull<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.119> through<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:06.959> have<00:01:07.109> kind<00:01:07.319> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
loop pull it through so you have kind of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.069 
loop pull it through so you have kind of
a<00:01:07.439> figure<00:01:07.619> eight<00:01:08.359> and<00:01:09.359> then<00:01:09.780> pull<00:01:09.929> it<00:01:10.020> down

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
a figure eight and then pull it down

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.289 
a figure eight and then pull it down
when<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.889> cinch<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.249> down<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.880> official<00:01:12.209> use

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
when you cinch it down for official use

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.459 
when you cinch it down for official use
you<00:01:12.509> definitely<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:12.959> to<00:01:13.020> wet<00:01:13.139> it<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.319> some

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
you definitely want to wet it with some

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.949 
you definitely want to wet it with some
saliva<00:01:13.829> so<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.219> mono<00:01:14.399> doesn't<00:01:14.789> burn<00:01:14.939> wet<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
saliva so the mono doesn't burn wet it

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:16.609 
saliva so the mono doesn't burn wet it
really<00:01:16.170> well

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
really well

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.209 
really well
cinch<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.579> down<00:01:17.639> really<00:01:17.939> tight<00:01:18.179> and<00:01:19.069> you<00:01:20.069> have

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
cinch it down really tight and you have

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.539 
cinch it down really tight and you have
your<00:01:20.399> loop<00:01:20.990> now<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.499> weight<00:01:22.709> always<00:01:23.159> goes<00:01:23.369> on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
your loop now your weight always goes on

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.019 
your loop now your weight always goes on
your<00:01:23.700> tag<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.149> here<00:01:24.740> never<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.039> loop<00:01:26.249> the

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:27.029 
your tag in here never on the loop the

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:30.289 
your tag in here never on the loop the
loop<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> also<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.869> cut<00:01:28.139> if<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.469> wish<00:01:29.209> to<00:01:30.209> have

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
loop can also be cut if you wish to have

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.449 
loop can also be cut if you wish to have
just<00:01:30.569> a<00:01:30.659> single<00:01:30.990> strand<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.499> your<00:01:31.619> hook<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
just a single strand for your hook and

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.550 
just a single strand for your hook and
your<00:01:32.670> hook<00:01:32.789> will<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.149> here<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.139> as<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.380> said

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
your hook will go on here but as I said

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
your hook will go on here but as I said
it's<00:01:34.709> very<00:01:34.770> important<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.579> tag<00:01:35.819> in<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it's very important that your tag in is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.389 
it's very important that your tag in is
where<00:01:37.139> your<00:01:37.259> weight<00:01:37.409> always<00:01:37.829> goes<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.219> the

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
where your weight always goes on the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.309 
where your weight always goes on the
setup<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.479> your<00:01:39.630> hook<00:01:39.749> goes<00:01:39.959> on<00:01:40.109> the

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
setup and then your hook goes on the

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.410 
setup and then your hook goes on the
either<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.039> entire<00:01:41.279> loop<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.849> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.179> like<00:01:42.389> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
either the entire loop or you can like I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
either the entire loop or you can like I
said<00:01:42.509> trim<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.929> loop<00:01:43.109> and<00:01:43.289> use<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.649> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
said trim the loop and use it on just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.730 
said trim the loop and use it on just
the<00:01:44.099> tag<00:01:44.279> in<00:01:44.459> there<00:01:44.869> that's<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.409> strong

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the tag in there that's a very strong

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.279 
the tag in there that's a very strong
dropper<00:01:47.159> loop<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:48.209> lot<00:01:48.689> stronger<00:01:48.899> than<00:01:49.169> the

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
dropper loop a lot stronger than the

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.690 
dropper loop a lot stronger than the
standard<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.679> that<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.279> people<00:01:50.490> tie

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
standard one that a lot of people tie

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.109 
standard one that a lot of people tie
and<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.539> I<00:01:51.569> said<00:01:51.779> it's<00:01:52.499> definitely<00:01:53.119> very

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and like I said it's definitely very

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.039 
and like I said it's definitely very
very<00:01:54.419> good<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.679> purpose
