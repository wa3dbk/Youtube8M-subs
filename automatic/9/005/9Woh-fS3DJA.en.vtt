00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.379 

they<00:00:02.129> have<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.399> make<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.639> hole<00:00:02.820> smaller<00:00:03.090> so

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
they have to make the hole smaller so

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.789 
they have to make the hole smaller so
what<00:00:03.540> they<00:00:03.629> do<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.929> like<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:04.200> say<00:00:04.380> they<00:00:04.560> grind

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
what they do is like you say they grind

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.829 
what they do is like you say they grind
the<00:00:04.950> cap<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> hole<00:00:06.240> smaller<00:00:06.509> and

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the cap to make the hole smaller and

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.450 
the cap to make the hole smaller and
then<00:00:06.930> they<00:00:07.049> read<00:00:07.259> line<00:00:07.740> board<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.220> center

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
then they read line board so the center

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.980 
then they read line board so the center
of<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> hole<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.970> gonna<00:00:09.150> move<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.599> into<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
of the hole is gonna move up into the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.950 
of the hole is gonna move up into the
block<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.190> see<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:12.179> if<00:00:12.750> your

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
block so you can see that if your

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.709 
block so you can see that if your
transmission<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.860> perfect<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:15.420> first<00:00:15.599> time

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
transmission was perfect the first time

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.310 
transmission was perfect the first time
around

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
around

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.769 
around
now<00:00:16.680> after<00:00:16.859> your<00:00:17.039> line<00:00:17.250> board<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.699> may<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
now after your line board it may not I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.470 
now after your line board it may not I
see<00:00:19.080> okay<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.150> both<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
see okay so what we do is we both the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060 
see okay so what we do is we both the
bell<00:00:21.630> housing<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.320> then<00:00:22.800> we've<00:00:22.890> got<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
bell housing on and then we've got a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
bell housing on and then we've got a
dial<00:00:23.340> indicator<00:00:23.449> mm-hmm<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> will<00:00:25.410> set<00:00:25.619> up

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
dial indicator mm-hmm that I will set up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.730 
dial indicator mm-hmm that I will set up
right<00:00:25.920> now

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
right now

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
right now
interesting<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.890> basically<00:00:29.220> what's<00:00:29.429> happened

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
interesting so basically what's happened

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
interesting so basically what's happened
is<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.050> bell<00:00:31.439> housing<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.859> on

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
is that that the the bell housing is on

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
is that that the the bell housing is on
the<00:00:32.160> dowel<00:00:32.399> pen<00:00:32.730> simulating<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> motor

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the dowel pen simulating the motor

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.700 
the dowel pen simulating the motor
that's<00:00:34.230> correct

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that's correct

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.430 
that's correct
and<00:00:34.829> you'd<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> dial<00:00:36.329> indicator<00:00:36.510> basically

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and you'd the dial indicator basically

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
and you'd the dial indicator basically
is<00:00:37.649> simulating<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> center<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.420> crank

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
is simulating the center of the crank

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.790 
is simulating the center of the crank
shaft<00:00:39.780> that's<00:00:40.230> correct

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
shaft that's correct

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.389 
shaft that's correct
all<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.410> want<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
all right now what we want to do is it's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940 
all right now what we want to do is it's
important<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.809> hole<00:00:46.590> be

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
important that the that the hole be

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
important that the that the hole be
within<00:00:47.340> five<00:00:47.760> thousandths<00:00:48.570> hmm<00:00:49.140> that's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
within five thousandths hmm that's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.869 
within five thousandths hmm that's
pretty<00:00:49.800> tight<00:00:50.039> crunch<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> be

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
pretty tight crunch but you want to be

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.090 
pretty tight crunch but you want to be
within<00:00:51.059> five<00:00:51.449> thousandths<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.770> center

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
within five thousandths of the center

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
within five thousandths of the center
bore<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.610> crank<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.539> there<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.199> other

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
bore of your crank I see there are other

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.069 
bore of your crank I see there are other
considerations<00:00:56.100> also<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.210> phases<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
considerations also the the phases of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.619 
considerations also the the phases of
the<00:00:58.649> transmission<00:00:59.399> should<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.850> absolutely

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the transmission should be absolutely

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
the transmission should be absolutely
parallel<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> same<00:01:02.070> plane<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.969> face

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
parallel on the same plane as the face

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729 
parallel on the same plane as the face
of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> back<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> ball<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.140> correct

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
of the back of the ball that's correct

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.230 
of the back of the ball that's correct
when<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.100> bell<00:01:05.250> housing<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.670> made<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
when our bell housing is made and it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480 
when our bell housing is made and it
comes<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> press<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.950> Blanchard

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
comes out of the press then we Blanchard

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
comes out of the press then we Blanchard
grind<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> first<00:01:09.180> both<00:01:09.960> sides<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.860> grind<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
grind it first both sides we grind the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
grind it first both sides we grind the
bottom<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:11.970> grind<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> top<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.930> they're

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
bottom then we grind the top so they're

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.249 
bottom then we grind the top so they're
parallel<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.520> after<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.869> bore

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
parallel then after that then we bore

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
parallel then after that then we bore
the<00:01:16.740> center<00:01:17.040> bore<00:01:17.250> off<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.030> these<00:01:18.119> dowel<00:01:18.390> pins

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the center bore off of these dowel pins

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
the center bore off of these dowel pins
so<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.680> correct<00:01:19.920> we

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so that we know that that's correct we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.830 
so that we know that that's correct we
don't<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> punch<00:01:21.270> our<00:01:21.450> Bell<00:01:21.630> housings

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
don't go and punch our Bell housings

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870 
don't go and punch our Bell housings
with<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> holes<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.549> have

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
with all the holes in it and then have

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.109 
with all the holes in it and then have
it<00:01:24.000> painted<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> ship<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> door

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
it painted and ship it out the door

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.190 
it painted and ship it out the door
offset<00:01:27.119> dowel<00:01:27.330> pins<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.780> been<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
since these aftermarket Bell housings

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
of whatever and when you check it and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
of whatever and when you check it and
you<00:01:44.460> find<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.180> bell<00:01:45.299> housing<00:01:45.420> for

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you find out that your bell housing for

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.960 
you find out that your bell housing for
instance<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> twenty<00:01:46.890> five<00:01:47.040> thousand<00:01:47.490> six<00:01:47.640> out

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
instance is twenty five thousand six out

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
instance is twenty five thousand six out
what<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.320> how<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:50.070> do

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
what do you do then how do you how do

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.030 
what do you do then how do you how do
you<00:01:50.189> correct<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> well<00:01:51.060> back<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.420> old<00:01:51.600> days

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
you correct it well back in the old days

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
you correct it well back in the old days
before<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.280> adjustable<00:01:54.210> dowel<00:01:54.360> pins<00:01:54.570> what

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
before the adjustable dowel pins what

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.030 
before the adjustable dowel pins what
the<00:01:54.810> guys<00:01:54.960> were<00:01:55.110> doing<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.500> opening<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the guys were doing is opening up the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800 
the guys were doing is opening up the
holes<00:01:56.280> mm-hmm<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.570> would<00:01:57.780> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
holes mm-hmm and then they would just

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
holes mm-hmm and then they would just
take<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> hammer<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.560> knock<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> around<00:01:59.159> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
take a hammer and knock it around so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
take a hammer and knock it around so
they<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> right<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.140> would

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they got it right and then they would

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.510 
they got it right and then they would
take<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.770> weld<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.159> washer<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.399> over<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
take and weld a washer over the over the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.930 
take and weld a washer over the over the
dowel<00:02:05.700> pin<00:02:05.939> now<00:02:06.770> that's<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.979> way<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> locating

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
dowel pin now that's a way of locating

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.760 
dowel pin now that's a way of locating
the<00:02:09.119> bell<00:02:09.239> housing<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.229> here's<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> negative

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the bell housing but here's the negative

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.920 
the bell housing but here's the negative
sight<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.550> because<00:02:11.940> when<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> weld<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.569> washer

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
sight is because when you weld a washer

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.610 
sight is because when you weld a washer
to<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.230> plan

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to this plan

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.899 
to this plan
and<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.069> were<00:02:14.190> talking<00:02:14.340> about<00:02:14.489> parallelism

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
and we were talking about parallelism

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.539 
and we were talking about parallelism
right<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:16.500> put<00:02:16.680> heat<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.159> new<00:02:17.250> weld<00:02:17.459> on

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
right you put heat on here new weld on

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.860 
right you put heat on here new weld on
it<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:17.819> gonna<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.150> parallel<00:02:18.510> anymore

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
it it's not gonna be parallel anymore

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.539 
it it's not gonna be parallel anymore
yeah<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.379> basically<00:02:19.769> heat-treated<00:02:20.310> yeah

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
yeah this basically heat-treated yeah

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.309 
yeah this basically heat-treated yeah
you<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.480> did<00:02:21.629> now<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.140> put

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
you just what you did now is you put

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.800 
you just what you did now is you put
heat<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:22.950> warp<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.430> flange<00:02:23.810> so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
heat here you just warp this flange so

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
heat here you just warp this flange so
now<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.620> flange<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.190> warped<00:02:26.489> which<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.760> bolt

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
now this flange is warped which you bolt

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.210 
now this flange is warped which you bolt
this<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.599> block<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.799> guarantees

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
this up to the block what guarantees

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.360 
this up to the block what guarantees
this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.610> gonna<00:02:29.730> be<00:02:29.849> parallel<00:02:30.209> yeah<00:02:30.540> okay<00:02:31.370> so

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
this is gonna be parallel yeah okay so

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.490 
this is gonna be parallel yeah okay so
what<00:02:32.549> they<00:02:32.640> did<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.030> they<00:02:33.060> developed<00:02:33.720> offset

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
what they did is they developed offset

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
what they did is they developed offset
Dell<00:02:34.709> pens<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.459> buy<00:02:35.640> them<00:02:35.879> in

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
Dell pens and you would buy them in

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.050 
Dell pens and you would buy them in
different<00:02:36.180> settings<00:02:37.579> what<00:02:38.579> would<00:02:38.700> happen

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
different settings what would happen

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460 
different settings what would happen
though<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.390> they're<00:02:39.569> kind<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.900> pain<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.170> put

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
though is they're kind of a pain to put

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.500 
though is they're kind of a pain to put
in<00:02:40.590> because<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.430> press<00:02:41.640> fit<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.360> have

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
in because it's a press fit so you have

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.059 
in because it's a press fit so you have
to<00:02:42.629> knock<00:02:43.049> them<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.349> with<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.530> hammer

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
to knock them in with a hammer

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.339 
to knock them in with a hammer
put<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.519> on<00:02:44.670> check<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.209> nope<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:45.870> not<00:02:46.079> right

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
put it on check it nope that's not right

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.500 
put it on check it nope that's not right
take<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:47.010> out<00:02:47.160> try<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.819> calculate<00:02:48.090> how<00:02:48.359> much

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
take it out try to calculate how much

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.880 
take it out try to calculate how much
you<00:02:48.599> got<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> do<00:02:48.930> rotate<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.650> I'll<00:02:49.739> come

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you got to do rotate it and I'll come

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.119 
you got to do rotate it and I'll come
back<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.579> on<00:02:50.730> hmm<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:52.410> have<00:02:52.530> McCloud<00:02:52.859> we

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
back and so on hmm we have McCloud we

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.420 
back and so on hmm we have McCloud we
have<00:02:53.310> engineered<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.269> new<00:02:54.980> offset<00:02:55.980> Dow<00:02:56.160> pen

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
have engineered a new offset Dow pen

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.610 
have engineered a new offset Dow pen
which<00:02:56.609> is<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> concentric<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.440> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
which is a concentric and what it is is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.910 
which is a concentric and what it is is
the<00:02:59.129> bottom<00:02:59.430> half<00:02:59.640> is<00:03:00.470> what<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.590> actually

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the bottom half is what you actually

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.589 
the bottom half is what you actually
drive<00:03:02.159> in<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.700> press<00:03:02.970> into<00:03:03.180> your<00:03:03.390> block

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
drive in you press into your block

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.080 
drive in you press into your block
mm-hmm<00:03:04.590> we've<00:03:04.739> got<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> we've<00:03:05.370> got<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.609> set<00:03:05.879> screw

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
mm-hmm we've got a we've got a set screw

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.140 
mm-hmm we've got a we've got a set screw
right<00:03:06.329> here<00:03:06.569> is<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.019> oh<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:08.340> see<00:03:08.700> okay<00:03:08.970> so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
right here is there oh I see okay so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.610 
right here is there oh I see okay so
this<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.569> actually<00:03:09.720> an<00:03:09.989> eccentric<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
this is actually an eccentric that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.399 
this is actually an eccentric that
rotates<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:11.670> right<00:03:11.909> and<00:03:12.750> we've<00:03:12.959> got<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.170> set

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
rotates that's right and we've got a set

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.309 
rotates that's right and we've got a set
screw<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.859> middle<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.390> see<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.810> loosen

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
screw in the middle I see so you loosen

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.839 
screw in the middle I see so you loosen
it<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.829> all<00:03:17.129> you<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.430> do<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.639> put<00:03:17.819> a
