00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.390
 wiesenbach today I have to you first 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.370
 unfortunately a sad message public 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.370
 a rabbit is rick 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.580
 where is the rabbit i already have 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.530
 searched everything 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.880
 I also noticed it myself 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.660
 have already been in the whole 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.190
 sought nothing to find 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:05.110
 When did you last see it? 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.460
 that was yesterday evening, something is coming 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.680
 Look closely at us again 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.440
 rabbit hutch maybe we discover 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.750
 a hint 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.790
 there is nothing to see 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.430
 Look here to lie down there and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.879
 hair why he actually has 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.760
 there is time 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:28.180
 daily what are those feathers that are 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.040
 certainly feathers of a bird of prey 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.280
 right and the hair seems to be one 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.160
 to be fox 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.800
 Are you going to say so, yes , unfortunately 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.350
 what it looks like was the rabbit 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 eaten by the fox or the raptor 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.730
 oh no, please say that it is not true 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.110
 Of course, that's not what we know 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.980
 but as it looks 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.580
 everything points to rabbit away 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.540
 feathers and hair found 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.020
 just what annoys why not why 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.160
 lying around the hair and wheels around he was 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.890
 because then you are right there it is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.140
 strange 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.570
 Look, there he is something I am 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.580
 have found 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.790
 You know what maybe we can do there 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.000

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.220

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.010

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.880
