00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.110
 now all welcome to this new 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.100
 tutorial in this video I'm going to talk 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.780
 on how to make hands and arms 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.299
 again I am aware that 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.010
 not only better drawing nor the tutorial anymore 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.960
 complete but it 's the way that I 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.419
 I learned and I will share it with you 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.099
 so I'm doing several examples 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.099
 of different types of humans in various 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.839
 positions always start with the 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.619
 circle that is the basis of all the 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:33.949
 drawings frame the center where the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.309
 thumb where the circle ends is 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.890
 where the fingers start and here the hand 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.590
 extended I'm putting it in the size 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.690
 total one circle and three quarters of another 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.449
 the three quarters is the size of the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.850
 fingers and nothing else are divided into four 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.379
 lines that are of the same thickness for 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.379
 that the proportional hand remains 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.730
 to make a fist of another type of sight 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 in I base the circle and the only thing that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.680
 excels is the thumb and the index finger 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.170
 just like I'm showing this I say 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.350
 there's not much much master science 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.770
 to make fist closed the curious data 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.220
 that the thumb will never happen anymore 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 beyond him 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.620
 of the ring finger that index and a half to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.770
 get on the thumb 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.750
 in almost all the drawings well it is puts 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.240
 opposite I also base the circle 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.040
 and nothing more for them to see that the finger of 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.420
 medium 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 is a little bit higher than the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.600
 the rest 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.759
 another example of the thumb 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.990
 index and a half and the other two are 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.990
 visible like this 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.280
 the open hand 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.090
 there is not much to explain this 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.170
 the circle and coming out the four lines 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.659
 nothing more taking into account that the finger 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.990
 of the middle and the ring finger being a 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.400
 little longer than the others 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.720
 here I will be holding something and I put 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 the thumb a little bit over the post of 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.950
 what you are grabbing and the other fingers 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.030
 the illusion must also be given 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.550
 extra that is grabbing whatever it is that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.349
 is that you look at the drawing so that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.349
 give the illusion that you are holding something 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.880
 the fist the side fist is one of the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.210
 that it complicated me I cut the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.980
 machado 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.250
 the reality does not have much science the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.780
 base is the central point a little bit more 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.300
 down and the thumb is made 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.960
 working on the circle and 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.960
 after putting 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030
 in tenosique 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.819
 the circle also helps us to 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.330
 any type of position any 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.670
 type type of angle 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.470
 because I know that it is neither in front nor in 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.460
 side these three quarters is the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.460
 circle helped us for everything 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.180
 now for the arms is not much 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.980
 science simply with the circle to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.530
 the shoulder 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.360
 curved lines to put what is the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.960
 muscle and then he 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.720
 the lower part of the arm and when the 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.490
 Bent arm is exactly the same 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.610
 now that if you want to make a drawing 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.330
 comic type and the nice thing is to exaggerate the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.570
 muscles 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.350
 for example this guy hulk have if the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:55.180
 muscles too highlighted 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.180
 and when the arm is bent 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.810
 the muscle shrinks a little and it 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.330
 widens by the same 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.330
 with the same action that the muscle does 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.470
 and exaggerate exaggerate 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.630
 a fact that I always use for 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.840
 arms is the measure so that they are not left 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.630
 hollows of form forgiveness of the shoulder to 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.420
 elbow and elbow to the wrist should be the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.420
 same size so that it is proportional 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.540
 I hope you liked them 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.540
 have served in some way 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.550
 and leave your comments your suggestions
