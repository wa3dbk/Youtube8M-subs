 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.670

 occasion and how can you finally check 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.300
 has encouraged me to make a small 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.340
 I walk through a field that I have here near 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 where I live is a very pine forest 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 big where people come to walk their 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.379
 animals to run and others that as you see 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.040
 It is a very large pine forest with many 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.440
 clues and where the people for how he forgot 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.269
 Do your outdoor activities and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.920
 nothing today I'm here because I wanted 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.350
 show you a new piece that I've 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.680
 acquired for my knives collection 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.049
 and as I say it encourages me or I say I'm going to give you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.930
 a walk through the countryside that today makes good 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.760
 day little by little slowly and nothing without 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.190
 more then I will go to show you already with 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.140
 the permission of lucas that as you see already we 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.900
 you have it here prepared 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.960
 the knife that I want to teach you not to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.810
 is neither more nor less than this one that has 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.369
 there prepared that is the morÃ¡n to these 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.910
 cut the rope night or closed that like 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.350
 you see is a typical aesthetic knife 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.509
 of the berries 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.490
 as I already have you used to which 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 as you already know me I could not resist 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.259
 and I made a modification in his case 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.780
 as you are already seeing that right now 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.690
 I'll teach you first of all I love you 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.670
 apologize for the sound or the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.070
 image quality because as you know no 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 I have very appropriate means and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.640
 this is going to be my first video in 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:11.430
 outside but good I hope you like it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:13.750
 and the camera and I'm going to show you the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.680
 knife 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.680
 Y 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.609
 perfect then nothing as I say the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.269
 knife is this that you see here is the 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:34.329
 more a knife top than rock band that 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.219
 name owes it to the typical 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.439
 we are used to fashion has the 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.980
 same aesthetics of the eye but with a 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.980
 particularity 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.639
 seen or combined is the only knife 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.079
 of the house dwells that I know by removing 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.629
 the current models that you have taken to 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.730
 market that has this edge the sheet is 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.879
 it has a skandi edge and the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.200
 you know 2 millimeters thick but 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.750
 it's like I tell you it has the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.930
 particularity of which of the 10 with 2 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.840
 millimeters that has sheet has 3 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.900
 millimeters or forgiveness 3 centimeters of 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.239
 smooth edge in its made its tip and the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.120
 rest are 7 centimeters with two 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.010
 about a closed edge I do not know 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.560
 if the camera will focus very well 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.510
 particular the rest I already tell you is the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.310
 me the same as we do 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.540
 two millimeters thick 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.209
 10 points long and a width of and a 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.930
 shovel width of two centimeters several 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.750
 its handle as you see is made in 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.270
 orange polymer or orange plastic 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.280
 very resistant very hard coated by 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.519
 a gummy material I imagine that it will be 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.920
 rubber that has as a kind of of 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.840
 ovals rom whistles that make it very 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.330
 comfortable grip in your hand 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.010
 very good in these knives and a 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.459
 front and back guard as already 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.260
 you know nothing as I tell you it's a knife 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.600
 that I like a lot because it 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.700
 out of the ordinary is not your typical 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.830
 knife ready and to take it in 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.290
 our team as a secondary knife 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.239
 Well, I thought it would be very good 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.320
 let's leave it here and now I'm going 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:20.320
 to pass on your board 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.010
 You know her before I was in a 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.860
 low knife you also remember if 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.970
 you do not have the video on my channel, it's 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 a sleeve made with a shoulder pad 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.560
 those who carry the bandoliers do not carry 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.150
 computers and how it came into their 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.360
 inside a knife I have put it 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.760
 inside I 've taken you from these straps in 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.360
 your back so you can pass a 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.460
 belt for him and the other on the other 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.310
 I put this ring or rim side 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.140
 plastic attached to the clip of the case 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.110
 of the Mora keeper orange as I tell you 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.720
 bank to pass the belt 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.510
 also and another thing that I have done to him 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.900
 been inserting or incorporating this 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.730
 sharpener of the house smith I do not know if what 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.210
 you know that it has a ceramic piece 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.930
 another carbide and a diamond edge 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:22.140
 that for this knife is ideal because 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:26.710
 how has the edge tried since this one 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:30.220
 is this sharpener comes from luxury to 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.660
 fix it and set it apart as there are now spas and 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.150
 let's see if I can take it out because 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.310
 it's a bit tight I've gotten a 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.980
 bar of which you already know also 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.830
 of my other high house kits from 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.410
 magnesium with a built-in style end and 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.930
 a built-in scraper which makes 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.080
 be a secondary knife for equipment 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.630
 of very very interesting survival and 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.430
 nothing like I say to me I liked 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.430
 that's why I'm going to teach it 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:19.960
 rises to 226 and the edge it has is the 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.500
 skandi who already know how to make a cutter 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.680
 natural with a thickness of 2 millimeters and 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.590
 a closed or pearly mixed edge of 3 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.110
 centimeters of zinc or smooth and 7 with 2 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.780
 roughly closed or smooth 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.060
 it's not taking off completely as you know the 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.610
 explains this knife comes to a 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:47.110
 about a quarter of the 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:50.170
 mango and I hope you liked it 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.560
 You give me a law and I already say sorry for the 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.560
 quality 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.780
 video then it promises as always 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.409
 goodbye 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.800
 to
