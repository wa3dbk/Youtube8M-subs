long run so we're just going to walk
through<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.170> simple

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
through how to do it it's pretty simple

command-line executable so the start up
I<00:00:37.860> need<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> command<00:00:38.730> prompt<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.660> running

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
I need a command prompt that I'm running

and that should be it I'm installing the
service<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.359> name<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.959> had<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.739> tell<00:02:24.010> it

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
service I have the name I had to tell it

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.679

where<00:02:24.219> the<00:02:24.340> log<00:02:24.489> file<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:24.969> to<00:02:25.060> be<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.659> I

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
where the log file is going to be so I

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.449 
where the log file is going to be so I
just<00:02:25.870> press<00:02:26.019> ENTER<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:28.230> nothing<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.500> so

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
just have to start it this first time by

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.280 
just have to start it this first time by

services tab which is Type R LM so
installed<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.989> but<00:02:44.170> didn't<00:02:44.349> start<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:44.980> just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
installed it but didn't start it so just

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.020

right click start the service and again

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.699 
right click start the service and again
well<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:49.959> don't<00:02:50.139> know<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.349> saw<00:02:50.530> that

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
well I don't know if you saw that

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.429 
well I don't know if you saw that
actually<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:52.030> says<00:02:52.239> access<00:02:52.870> denied<00:02:53.169> that's

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
actually it says access denied that's

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.629 
actually it says access denied that's
because<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.769> can't<00:02:53.799> do<00:02:54.129> it<00:02:54.220> from<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.430> task

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
because I can't do it from the task

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.349 
because I can't do it from the task
manager<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.139> services<00:02:56.650> console<00:02:57.359> let

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
manager go to the services console let

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.449 
manager go to the services console let
me<00:02:58.450> bring<00:02:58.629> that<00:02:58.689> down<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.859> again<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.280> same

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
me bring that down so again the same

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.899 
me bring that down so again the same
thing<00:03:00.519> find<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.299> our<00:03:01.450> LM<00:03:01.750> solid<00:03:02.319> angle<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
thing find the our LM solid angle and

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.059 
thing find the our LM solid angle and
then<00:03:03.909> I<00:03:03.970> could<00:03:04.120> just<00:03:04.349> start<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:05.500> here<00:03:05.829> or<00:03:06.010> I

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
then I could just start it here or I

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.869 
then I could just start it here or I
could<00:03:06.220> right-click<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:06.879> start<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:08.879> and

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
could right-click it and start it and

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.659 
could right-click it and start it and
it's<00:03:10.120> set<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.329> automatic<00:03:10.900> which<00:03:11.079> means<00:03:11.669> it's

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
it's set to automatic which means it's

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.250 
it's set to automatic which means it's
always<00:03:13.000> going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.209> restart<00:03:13.599> it's<00:03:14.049> going<00:03:14.200> to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
always going to restart it's going to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.780 
always going to restart it's going to
start<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> cerveteri<00:03:15.099> time<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.340> reboot<00:03:15.609> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
start the cerveteri time to reboot the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.599 
start the cerveteri time to reboot the
computer<00:03:15.909> turn<00:03:16.480> on<00:03:16.689> and<00:03:16.840> off<00:03:17.370> whatever<00:03:18.370> and

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
computer turn on and off whatever and

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.500 
computer turn on and off whatever and
actually<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.120> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:21.269> command<00:03:22.269> line

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
actually you can see the command line

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.140 
actually you can see the command line
that<00:03:22.540> was<00:03:22.780> executed<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.459> that's<00:03:25.359> done<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:27.150> so

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
that was executed so that's done and so

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.199 
that was executed so that's done and so
I<00:03:28.209> guess<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.540> thing<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:30.310> idea<00:03:30.579> now<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.790> that

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
I guess the thing the idea now is that

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.390 
I guess the thing the idea now is that
it's<00:03:31.329> actually<00:03:31.599> serving<00:03:32.500> licenses<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.129> Arnold

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it's actually serving licenses to Arnold

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.530 
it's actually serving licenses to Arnold
so<00:03:33.549> let's<00:03:33.729> just<00:03:33.849> check<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.150> out<00:03:34.299> I'm<00:03:34.419> going

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so let's just check that out I'm going

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.589 
so let's just check that out I'm going
to<00:03:34.599> use<00:03:34.720> Softimage<00:03:36.000> let's<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.180> our<00:03:37.359> draw

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
to use Softimage let's just our draw

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.409 
to use Softimage let's just our draw
render<00:03:37.989> region<00:03:38.819> now<00:03:39.819> if<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.090> hadn't<00:03:40.269> been<00:03:40.329> able

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
render region now if I hadn't been able

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.640 
render region now if I hadn't been able
to<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.659> a<00:03:40.690> license<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.139> would<00:03:41.290> have<00:03:41.379> seen<00:03:41.530> an

to get a license I would have seen an

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.729 
to get a license I would have seen an

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
error down here and also you can see I'm

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.059 
error down here and also you can see I'm

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.590 
manually so we see the license is going
out<00:05:39.690> in<00:05:40.200> as<00:05:40.560> Arnold<00:05:40.979> renders<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:42.060> that's<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.479> I
