00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
to get that leg to go over to the side

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.960 
to get that leg to go over to the side
this<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.780> not<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> good<00:02:55.440> thing<00:02:55.470> either<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.730> will

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

not<00:02:57.150> build<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> muscles<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.920> would

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
not build up the muscles that you would
