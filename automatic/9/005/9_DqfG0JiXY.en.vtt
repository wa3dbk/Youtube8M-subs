00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.950 
it's just like a really i don't know
this<00:03:44.670> would<00:03:44.820> be<00:03:44.850> really<00:03:45.180> pretty<00:03:45.390> full<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.750> i

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
this would be really pretty full but i

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.140 
this would be really pretty full but i
really<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:46.650> spring<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.580> summer<00:03:47.730> too

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
really like it for spring and summer too

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.430 
really like it for spring and summer too
i<00:03:48.180> think<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.690> would<00:03:48.810> also<00:03:48.990> be<00:03:49.140> another

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
i think that would also be another

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.590 
i think that would also be another
pretty<00:03:49.770> one<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.190> toes<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.450> last

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
pretty one on the toes then the last

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.360 
pretty one on the toes then the last

I<00:03:58.110> wouldn't<00:03:58.440> call<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.740> a<00:03:58.800> jelly<00:03:59.160> but<00:03:59.550> it<00:03:59.640> wasn't

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
I wouldn't call it a jelly but it wasn't

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.340 
I wouldn't call it a jelly but it wasn't
like<00:04:01.260> super<00:04:02.070> opaque<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.910> was<00:04:03.210> I<00:04:03.660> guess<00:04:03.870> in

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
like super opaque it was I guess in

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.640 
like super opaque it was I guess in
between<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:05.190> jelly<00:04:05.460> and<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.410> just<00:04:07.440> a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
between a jelly and you know just a

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.150 
between a jelly and you know just a
regular<00:04:07.830> cream<00:04:08.250> polish<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.650> when<00:04:10.650> there

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
regular cream polish but just when there

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.770 
regular cream polish but just when there
are<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> little<00:04:11.490> more<00:04:11.700> translucent<00:04:12.270> like<00:04:12.600> that

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
are a little more translucent like that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.380 
are a little more translucent like that
they<00:04:13.170> get<00:04:13.440> they<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.100> look<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.250> glossy<00:04:14.820> they

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
they get they just look so glossy they

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.830 
they get they just look so glossy they
apply<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.109> nicely<00:04:17.120> they're<00:04:18.120> much<00:04:18.330> easier<00:04:18.359> to

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
apply so nicely they're much easier to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.349 
apply so nicely they're much easier to
work<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.170> to<00:04:19.530> get<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.680> nice

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359
