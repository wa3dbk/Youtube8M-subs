Jam XT it is a Bluetooth speaker that is
actually<00:00:08.099> pretty<00:00:08.250> rugged<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.090> built-in

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
actually pretty rugged it's a built-in

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.690 
actually pretty rugged it's a built-in
carabiner<00:00:10.290> here<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:11.040> clip<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.550> go

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
carabiner here so you can clip it and go

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.690 
carabiner here so you can clip it and go
like<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.710> it<00:00:13.710> has<00:00:13.860> good<00:00:14.040> sound<00:00:14.219> as<00:00:14.400> we'll<00:00:14.549> see

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
like that it has good sound as we'll see

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.760 
like that it has good sound as we'll see
in<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.849> second<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.660> rechargeable<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.650> you

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.140 
in a second and it's rechargeable so you
can<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:16.980> eight<00:00:17.100> hours<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.520> battery<00:00:17.760> life<00:00:17.820> out

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
can get eight hours of battery life out

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.560 
can get eight hours of battery life out
of<00:00:18.330> it

Yankee Doodle I apologize for the lack

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.330 
Yankee Doodle I apologize for the lack
of<00:00:29.099> top-40<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.060> country<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:30.840> whatever<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.650> got

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
of top-40 or country or whatever but got

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
of top-40 or country or whatever but got
placed<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:32.969> happy<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.750> let's<00:00:34.020> see

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
placed at this not happy so let's see

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
placed at this not happy so let's see
how<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> looks<00:00:34.800> sounds<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> uh<00:00:35.820> let's<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.149> from

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
how it looks sounds and uh let's go from

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.500 
how it looks sounds and uh let's go from
there<00:00:36.420> okay<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.579> turn<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> speaker<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.210> by

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
there okay so we turn the speaker on by

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.060 
there okay so we turn the speaker on by
pushing<00:00:39.750> underneath<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.739> kind<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
pushing underneath which is kind of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.560 
pushing underneath which is kind of
confusing<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.730> has<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.969> little<00:00:42.120> battery

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
confusing so it has this little battery

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.779 
confusing so it has this little battery
light<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.110> too<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.800> turn<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> on

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
light on it too but you turn it on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.850 
light on it too but you turn it on
underneath<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.469> blue<00:00:46.649> light

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
underneath you see here the blue light

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.119 
underneath you see here the blue light
says<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.960> connected<00:00:48.960> bluetooth<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
says that it's connected bluetooth and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:24.210 
says that it's connected bluetooth and
again<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.180> gonna<00:00:51.270> try<00:00:51.539> any<00:00:51.780> key<00:00:51.899> doodle

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.230 

okay<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:25.280> what<00:01:25.490> she<00:01:25.580> should<00:01:25.760> have<00:01:25.880> seen<00:01:26.060> is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
okay so what she should have seen is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.410 
okay so what she should have seen is
that<00:01:26.270> speaker<00:01:26.659> sounds<00:01:27.170> pretty<00:01:28.159> darn<00:01:28.729> good<00:01:29.090> for

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
that speaker sounds pretty darn good for

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.359 
that speaker sounds pretty darn good for
the<00:01:29.479> speak<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> size<00:01:30.320> you'd<00:01:31.130> only<00:01:31.250> have

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
the speak of the size you'd only have

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.780 
the speak of the size you'd only have
one<00:01:31.940> driver<00:01:32.479> here<00:01:32.810> on<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.960> top<00:01:33.550> but<00:01:34.550> it<00:01:34.640> does

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
one driver here on the top but it does

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.399 
one driver here on the top but it does
sound<00:01:34.940> better<00:01:35.240> than<00:01:35.390> you'd<00:01:35.630> expect<00:01:35.780> now<00:01:36.229> I've

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
sound better than you'd expect now I've

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.440 
sound better than you'd expect now I've
tried<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.680> lot<00:01:36.800> of<00:01:36.950> Bluetooth<00:01:37.400> speakers<00:01:37.450> that

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
tried a lot of Bluetooth speakers that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.790 
tried a lot of Bluetooth speakers that
are<00:01:38.479> roughly<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.869> same<00:01:39.080> price<00:01:39.229> point<00:01:39.560> and

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
are roughly the same price point and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.859 
are roughly the same price point and
such<00:01:40.009> but<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:40.850> does<00:01:41.000> sound<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.600> think

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
such but this one does sound I think

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.080 
such but this one does sound I think
it's<00:01:42.020> good<00:01:42.200> as<00:01:42.470> there's<00:01:42.920> any<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:43.159> them<00:01:43.280> it

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's good as there's any of them it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.790 
it's good as there's any of them it
doesn't<00:01:44.240> have<00:01:44.479> booming<00:01:44.869> bass<00:01:45.050> which<00:01:45.619> you

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
doesn't have booming bass which you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800 
doesn't have booming bass which you
would<00:01:45.950> expect<00:01:46.369> since<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:46.759> has<00:01:46.909> one<00:01:47.330> speaker

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
would expect since it has one speaker

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.389 
would expect since it has one speaker
that's<00:01:47.960> about<00:01:48.140> two<00:01:48.380> inches<00:01:48.619> across<00:01:48.770> or<00:01:49.190> one

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
that's about two inches across or one

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.670 
that's about two inches across or one
driver<00:01:49.670> that's<00:01:50.119> two<00:01:50.270> inches<00:01:50.479> across<00:01:50.619> but<00:01:51.619> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
driver that's two inches across but it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.260 
driver that's two inches across but it
does<00:01:51.890> have<00:01:52.040> a<00:01:52.070> fuller<00:01:52.369> sound<00:01:52.700> than<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.090> would

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
does have a fuller sound than you would

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.469 
does have a fuller sound than you would
typically<00:01:54.280> associate<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.429> with<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:56.179> it

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
typically associate it with it it

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.999 
typically associate it with it it
doesn't<00:01:56.660> sound<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.110> transistor<00:01:57.619> radio<00:01:57.649> at

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
doesn't sound like a transistor radio at

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.779 
doesn't sound like a transistor radio at
all<00:01:58.100> terms<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.119> sound<00:01:59.330> volume<00:02:00.310> again<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.640> can

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
all terms of sound volume again you can

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:09.559 
all terms of sound volume again you can
hear<00:02:02.030> it'll<00:02:02.960> fill

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.039 

in<00:02:10.569> fact<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.140> actually<00:02:11.319> pretty<00:02:11.830> pretty<00:02:12.430> loud

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
in fact it's actually pretty pretty loud

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.940 
in fact it's actually pretty pretty loud
in<00:02:14.049> order<00:02:14.319> for<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:15.069> again<00:02:15.610> fill<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> room<00:02:16.510> of

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
in order for to again fill a room of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.199 
in order for to again fill a room of
medium<00:02:17.950> large<00:02:18.220> size<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.090> actually

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
medium large size so you can actually

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.270 
medium large size so you can actually
hear<00:02:19.480> outside<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:20.680> one<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.920> things<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.250> I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
hear outside so one of the things that I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.949 
hear outside so one of the things that I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
find is that some of these smaller

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.270 
find is that some of these smaller

when you take them outdoors they really

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.800 
when you take them outdoors they really
just<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.129> enough<00:02:27.400> oomph<00:02:27.810> to

just don't have enough oomph to
penetrate<00:02:29.739> open<00:02:30.220> spaces<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.239> does

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
penetrate open spaces but this one does

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.509

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
cable and it charges here in the back so

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.140 
cable and it charges here in the back so
you<00:03:07.750> flip<00:03:08.290> up<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.010> that's<00:03:09.910> where<00:03:10.060> you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
you flip up this and that's where you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.460 
you flip up this and that's where you
charge<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.609> so<00:03:12.880> uh<00:03:13.139> that<00:03:14.139> works<00:03:14.290> out

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
charge it and so uh that works out

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.849 
charge it and so uh that works out
pretty<00:03:14.560> well

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
pretty well

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.970
