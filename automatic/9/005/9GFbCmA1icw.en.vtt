 heavens who have already had their breakfast can 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 come here to learn what the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 common mistakes we make in our 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.080
 our food that we can not 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 We've already talked about surgeries. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 that the staff doing after 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.770
 to do the surgery to reduce the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.020
 The stomach that is needed is the dream. 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 who does the surgery and now about the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.680
 that the key to everything in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
 doctor so much to avoid having to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.210
 do surgery as we did 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.220
 let's keep going, everyone like 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.779
 doctor told everybody right here 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.520
 to thin for those who are overweight 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 for those who want to lose weight for those who already 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 to keep for those who want to have 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.710
 energy for those who do not want to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.239
 that 's all we want in life 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.890
 then perfect the following to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 We've already talked about the error that comes from 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 home without a breakfast gone out 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.700
 put something in the bag a food in the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.160
 bag and goes on the way comments or 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.440
 way or wake up five more minutes 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 early will make all the difference is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.649
 less time in the bath copying gives 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.989
 have a yogurt in the bank 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.900
 we find a way and find a way and o2 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.600
 how will the event be a sequence is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.330
 who does not eat breakfast will pass the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.040
 whole day to the whole morning 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.320
 pinching 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.830
 the presence in that game with five errors 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.400
 I did not believe in your article you can 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.770
 miss more 10 and court asking them 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.660
 that we really like to do right 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.010
 because it is and if the person has a good coffee 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.410
 In the morning she will not 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
 second mistake would be for example 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.850
 in the coffee with sugar the whole day is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.680
 a false belief that it goes from the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.660
 energy will have for a moment a bit 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 of disposition but in sequence issue 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.530
 Minutes will drop soon It will force you 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.900
 want another coffee with 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.430
 sugar and other things even worse 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.280
 For example, these butterscotch biscuits 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.100
 the defender 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.619
 eat together a joint now in this 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.530
 moment a frutinha better then a 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.619
 fruit a vitamin or even that people 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.660
 has this patch throughout the encounter nor 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.700
 even use oleaginous as the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.680
 Brazil nuts look that nice nuts 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.479
 dried apricot fruits 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.580
 things can also have breakfast that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.140
 works to take away the will of jealousy is 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.750
 put a little cinnamon in the coffee 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.690
 one sleep and the other use brown sugar 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.340
 by the type of residue it leaves in the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.300
 mouth does not feel like you're taking 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:29.630
 again very well let's see number 3 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.400
 in the rush that this is mine and when 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.970
 just around not even want to talk is 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:42.440
 big divide 2010 management with will 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.989
 It's also good to do something like this. 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.209
 will the scene is and a lot of people that 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.269
 calls for this is also more practical 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.010
 so here is only frying excess salt 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.680
 then it will contribute to the increase of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.230
 pressure by increasing fat will not 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.150
 gives the body's nutrition of the time will 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.560
 get tired of being stressed and 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:09.140
 calling the zone is good to have a wrong can 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 suddenly at the fair buy enough 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.100
 fruit and vegetables teacher found in 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.080
 field and led to deposition negotiates 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.930
 people are trading like this 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.580
 then the salty ones that the donuts of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.850
 house against the children instead of doing 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.340
 cold can be done even if it was the same 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.040
 the chicken finally in the scope of the presence 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.680
 green that good bodo next room 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.480
 come on, let's go, good coffee, I 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.370
 I have another lunch option neither 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.040
 that person who will not eat a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.760
 saltiness goes on self-service and thinks 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.340
 who is hitting the potato 8 vacancies 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.140
 this dish right're much carbohydrate to 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.850
 beautiful look I'm a Chinese pale 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.770
 science, I think we call it 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.560
 child's food having to pass the 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.820
 rest of the life eating of palates already 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.090
 I'm seeing here shows that people 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:07.070
 It took a little bit good but I will not 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.130
 eating rice noodles and potatoes 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.930
 fry is missing a protein that does not 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.360
 could take advantage of this same division 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.880
 was made in these three divisions 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.910
 then one would stay for example rice or 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.700
 like pasta paul a baked potato 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.770
 sadr is a power by j 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.410
 then the other would be the protein that can 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.520
 be a meat fish or chicken wine or 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.280
 there goes 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.980
 and the other good blue-green is now a 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.360
 salad and ep as paulo vai dish goes 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.910
 getting paid with anemia will stay 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.130
 tired goes hair so it's no use 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.300
 want one just after you got there go there 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.640
 go 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.830
 I'm not afraid of these five either. 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.250
 said the saint's own fc sock 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.700
 My God, I do not like the person so much. 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:00.410
 It is curious go there to play us 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:02.780
 eat here fits in the belly of a dinner 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.729
 more joyful great is this jet 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:11.720
 joy we are already happier with 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:13.400
 My God, the time will come with a come 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.260
 here, look how the person she 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.660
 used this blue whale to ease awareness 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.300
 but here you also have your for goods like this 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.229
 as the woman of the day to ensure the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.510
 goal 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.640
 It's accurate how striking it is a farce 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.090
 normal is the person who is here with me 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.320
 of the day but the band bar good to see the 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.539
 The next you spend the whole day . 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.030
 doing this here we want dinner 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.310
 here this idea is because the hunger it comes 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.620
 It was late, it just did not start in the morning. 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.690
 It's getting late in the afternoon. 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.190
 pets when night comes home 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.470
 that relax and lower the level of 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.479
 adrenaline is there she will want to 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.160
 to compensate, I worked so hard 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.370
 Dish will make a plate of itself and will 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.140
 sleeping will not only spend us just to 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.610
 You already know that end should have 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.130
 dinner has to be what so for 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.099
 not if a light dinner goes there 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.500
 for example a salad with a breast 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.740
 turkey or a chopped or 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.840
 chicken after having a carbohydrate 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.450
 vegetables with potato a carrot sports 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.910
 mode looks okay is a cinch will 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.099
 be a breakfast and lunch of 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.500
 prince and dinner of perfect measures 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.970
 get ready to go the definition so 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.260
 girls and remembering a course of one 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.270
 simple way as formerly some 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.270
 days like that but now it's changed
