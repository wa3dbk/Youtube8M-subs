00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.249
 I understand that then 

00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.759
 one of the women who has to keep a millionth off a new success 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.570
 maria sharapova 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.670
 the Russian and played against her compatriot alla kudrjavtseva 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.349
 for a place in the third round 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.550
 this is the 20 year old alla koedriavtseva 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.630
 if you think there I know mine had played so last year in the first round 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.779
 admired four match points against the later winner and she only lost 7 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.579
 5 in the third set 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.259
 she is playing again against a player from the top ten against maria sjarapova de 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.910
 winner of 2004 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.990
 this year placed third in london 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.470
 sjarapova has a very moderate start a lot of unnecessary mistakes it goes 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 very bad according to services 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.140
 the reformed mind 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 maybe it comes on a 4 2 lead 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 it then becomes 5 2 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
 in the first set smoothly with 6 2 but the response is awaiting 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.310
 set of the russin played very solidly 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.620
 maria sjarapova no chance, as said, gave sharapova far too many unnecessary 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 errors and no less than five duplicate errors 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.119
 by one of the second set 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.060
 you can sharapova a little better in the match 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.100
 it becomes 2 2 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.470
 four at a time 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 sharp over serving 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.670
 again such a carelessness of sharapova 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.820
 in the whole party it made 22 unnecessary mistakes 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.350
 those are not numbers that suit a player like maria sjarapova 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 a breakpoint they again in favor of kudryavtseva 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.430
 and she grabbed it 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.760

 the hunt opened on a 5 4 lead 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.100
 of course falls for maria sjarapova 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 making her opponent come up with sports 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.269
 one of the for the decision 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.149
 and so the sensation is what it is 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.059
 He went to the temple last night 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 however, the winner of 2004 maria sjarapova dropped out 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:26.559
