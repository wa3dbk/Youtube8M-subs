 welcome to this beautiful event 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.550
 we are pleasantly surprised by the world and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.590
 especially of the age group that is 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.270
 hyper large from the smallest to the largest 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 that they take pleasure in seeing the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.480
 entertainment and cayenne and y 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.100

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.200
 day we have good weather months this 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.180
 was not necessarily won and we have a 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.890
 lack not possible of very young 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.360
 children but also of all 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.800
 generations and I think that all the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.510
 world finds interest in coming on this 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.640
 day to discover what the saying is 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.830
 before all we fall from his barracks 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.690
 farc and manosque and that can allow 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.729
 to recruit why not tomorrow well 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 for manon and but for all of 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.509
 barracks of the department 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 that's exactly how it works 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.229
 after his open days 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.729
 to have inscriptions or wills 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.920

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.650
 department and it's a real breeding ground 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.250
 recruiting to leave your 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.750

 a lot of clay has since evolution 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.400
