thoughts on how they did explaining the
background<00:05:29.180> between<00:05:30.180> all<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.419> different

background between all the different

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.330 
background between all the different
races<00:05:30.870> in<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.380> history<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:31.890> all<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.160> kind

races in the history and all that kind
of<00:05:32.400> stuff<00:05:33.320> if<00:05:34.320> you're<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:34.710> picking<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.100> up

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
of stuff if you're just picking it up

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.100 
of stuff if you're just picking it up
for<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:37.740> first<00:05:37.919> time<00:05:38.220> now<00:05:38.940> having<00:05:39.780> played<00:05:39.990> the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
for the first time now having played the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.450 
for the first time now having played the
first<00:05:40.289> one<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.470> lot<00:05:40.740> but<00:05:41.130> not<00:05:41.280> really

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
first one a lot but not really

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.070 
first one a lot but not really
remembering<00:05:41.970> much<00:05:42.180> of<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.479> like<00:05:42.930> the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
remembering much of it like the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.840 
remembering much of it like the
intricacies<00:05:43.620> of<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.860> story<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.340> think<00:05:44.789> they

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
intricacies of the story I think they

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.029 
intricacies of the story I think they
did<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.030> really<00:05:45.090> good<00:05:45.479> job<00:05:45.539> of<00:05:45.720> refreshing<00:05:46.710> me

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
did a really good job of refreshing me

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.219 
did a really good job of refreshing me
it's<00:05:47.940> hard<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.270> say<00:05:48.479> if<00:05:48.630> they<00:05:48.750> did<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:48.990> good<00:05:49.169> job

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
it's hard to say if they did a good job

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.550 
it's hard to say if they did a good job
starting<00:05:50.039> from<00:05:50.070> scratch<00:05:50.490> but<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.320> would<00:05:52.320> not

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
starting from scratch but I would not

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.590 
starting from scratch but I would not
really<00:05:52.919> recommend<00:05:53.550> picking<00:05:53.729> up<00:05:54.030> number<00:05:54.390> one

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
really recommend picking up number one

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.690 
really recommend picking up number one
