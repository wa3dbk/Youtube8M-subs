00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
is a website but the website isn't where

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
is a website but the website isn't where
I<00:00:56.520> go<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> draw<00:00:57.620> website<00:00:58.620> is<00:01:00.620> website

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620

different<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> want<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
different but if you want to get this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.289 
different but if you want to get this
program<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.200> paint.net<00:01:08.299> because

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
program you go to get paint.net because

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.280 
program you go to get paint.net because
it's<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.570> gets<00:01:09.810> paint.net<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.990> that

it's like gets paint.net and and that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
it's like gets paint.net and and that
means<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.590> good<00:01:13.710> program<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> lets<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> draw

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
straight but alright so the important

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.990 
straight but alright so the important
thing<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.910> not<00:02:50.630> not<00:02:51.080> necessarily<00:02:51.790> accuracy<00:02:52.790> as

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
thing is not not necessarily accuracy as

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.830 
thing is not not necessarily accuracy as
much<00:02:53.330> as<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.720> feel<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:56.420> whatever<00:02:56.630> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
much as the feel of the of whatever it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.750 
much as the feel of the of whatever it
is<00:02:56.900> you're<00:02:57.080> drawing<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:57.739> like<00:02:58.459> he<00:02:58.519> doesn't

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
is you're drawing so like he doesn't

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.130

have<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.940> be<00:02:59.060> exact

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
have to be exact

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.420 
have to be exact
per<00:03:00.680> se<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.040> know<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.750> just<00:03:02.989> be<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:04.280> can

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
per se you know it can just be you can

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.530 
per se you know it can just be you can
just<00:03:04.610> kind<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.819> get<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> basic<00:03:05.420> idea<00:03:07.540> most

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
just kind of get the basic idea most

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.000 
just kind of get the basic idea most
important<00:03:08.989> thing<00:03:09.110> is<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.470> people<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.860> tell

well but so did this one so I guess I

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.370 
well but so did this one so I guess I
guess<00:06:32.000> there's<00:06:32.210> two<00:06:32.270> schools<00:06:32.690> of<00:06:32.810> thought<00:06:32.870> but

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
guess there's two schools of thought but

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.409

the important thing like I said is that

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:36.939 
the important thing like I said is that
people<00:06:35.629> know<00:06:35.779> who<00:06:35.930> it<00:06:36.080> is<00:06:36.110> you<00:06:36.590> know<00:06:36.710> here<00:06:36.919> he
