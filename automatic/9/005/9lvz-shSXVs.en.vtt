you can actually grab onto the soft part

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.790 
you can actually grab onto the soft part
of<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.010> jewel<00:05:15.220> there<00:05:16.350> being<00:05:17.350> very<00:05:17.560> careful

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
of the jewel there being very careful

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.830 
of the jewel there being very careful
not<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.310> touch<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.850> delicate<00:05:19.270> filaments<00:05:19.750> of

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
not to touch the delicate filaments of

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.690 
not to touch the delicate filaments of
the<00:05:19.960> gill<00:05:20.140> rakers<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:21.970> can<00:05:22.120> see<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.510> that

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
the gill rakers and I can see that that

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.590 
the gill rakers and I can see that that
spinner<00:05:24.700> is<00:05:25.180> only<00:05:25.360> just<00:05:25.600> inside<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.170> mouth

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.110 
every time you want hook a pikey I

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
always think it's like a surgical

off<00:05:35.920> what's<00:05:36.850> involved<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.690> mean<00:05:37.870> here<00:05:38.110> now<00:05:38.320> I

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
off what's involved I mean here now I

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.030 
off what's involved I mean here now I
can<00:05:38.620> see<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.900> one<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.290> points<00:05:41.680> is<00:05:41.800> caught

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
can see that one of the points is caught

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.220 
can see that one of the points is caught
dangerously<00:05:42.790> close<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.360> gill<00:05:43.600> rakers<00:05:43.630> so
