this<00:02:16.090> off<00:02:17.850> am<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:18.970> wondering<00:02:19.360> why<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:19.600> just

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
this off am I wondering why we just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.070 
this off am I wondering why we just
start<00:02:19.960> this<00:02:20.140> proof<00:02:20.350> video<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:21.870> inside<00:02:22.870> our

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
start this proof video like inside our

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.500 
start this proof video like inside our
house<00:02:23.260> or<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.800> house<00:02:23.980> well<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:25.330> because

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
house or the house well it's because

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.490 
house or the house well it's because
we're<00:02:25.600> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.840> going<00:02:26.080> somewhere<00:02:26.290> right

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
we're going to be going somewhere right

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.580 
we're going to be going somewhere right
now<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.360> might<00:02:28.360> as<00:02:28.450> well<00:02:28.600> just<00:02:28.780> do<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
now so might as well just do it on the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.650 
now so might as well just do it on the
road<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.820> way<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.030> could<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.240> uploaded

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
road and that way it could be uploaded

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.300 
road and that way it could be uploaded
faster<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.230> i<00:02:32.290> won't<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.830> convert<00:02:33.190> them

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
faster so i won't have to convert them

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.650 
faster so i won't have to convert them
to<00:02:34.170> windows<00:02:35.170> media<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:37.240> actually<00:02:37.540> better

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
to windows media so it's actually better

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.750 
to windows media so it's actually better
