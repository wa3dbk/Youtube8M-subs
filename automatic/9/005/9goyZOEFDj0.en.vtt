since I am no of trophies I'll take this

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.790 
since I am no of trophies I'll take this
one

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
one

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.550 
one
and<00:03:27.650> let's<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.980> drop<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.340> few<00:03:29.610> partridge<00:03:30.030> oh

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
you know I was not expecting that I was

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.550 
you know I was not expecting that I was

definitely not expecting that that is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.580 
definitely not expecting that that is
going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.890> make<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.030> much<00:03:42.270> harder<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.320> just

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590

archers<00:03:52.860> behind<00:03:52.980> them<00:03:53.370> just<00:03:53.970> quickly<00:03:54.210> take

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
archers behind them just quickly take

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:04.440 
archers behind them just quickly take
out<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> texts<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.470> then<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.830> downfall

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:14.250 

and<00:04:05.110> let's<00:04:05.500> just<00:04:05.590> surrender<00:04:06.129> right<00:04:06.280> here

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.259 

and<00:04:14.739> since<00:04:15.220> when<00:04:15.459> waste<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.790> buncha<00:04:16.060> troops

and since when waste a buncha troops

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.990 
and since when waste a buncha troops
let's<00:04:17.139> just<00:04:17.350> get<00:04:17.500> back<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.699> bathroom

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
let's just get back to the bathroom

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.090 
let's just get back to the bathroom
I<00:04:20.120> trained<00:04:20.840> up<00:04:20.989> some<00:04:21.170> troops<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.769> let's<00:04:22.010> just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
I trained up some troops and let's just

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.620 
I trained up some troops and let's just
go<00:04:22.750> so

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
go so

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.810 
go so
I'll<00:04:26.200> get<00:04:26.470> back<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.950> as<00:04:26.980> soon<00:04:27.160> as<00:04:27.370> we<00:04:27.610> find

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
I'll get back to you as soon as we find

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.030 
I'll get back to you as soon as we find
a<00:04:28.000> base<00:04:28.710> because<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.920> does<00:04:30.130> take<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.370> while<00:04:32.040> so

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
a base because it does take a while so

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.500 
a base because it does take a while so
we<00:04:33.490> have<00:04:33.610> found<00:04:33.940> our<00:04:34.210> base<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:36.090> good<00:04:37.090> amount<00:04:37.390> of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
we have found our base a good amount of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.540 
we have found our base a good amount of
you<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.870> there

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.790 

this<00:04:44.120> will<00:04:44.360> be<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> solid<00:04:44.930> raid<00:04:45.320> if<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.620> could

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
this will be a solid raid if we could

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.270 
this will be a solid raid if we could
get<00:04:45.920> all<00:04:46.070> this

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.390 

all<00:04:52.520> right<00:04:52.910> let's<00:04:53.360> start<00:04:53.620> from<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.680> bottom<00:04:55.010> I

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
all right let's start from the bottom I

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.080 
all right let's start from the bottom I
struck<00:04:56.240> one<00:04:56.690> barbarian<00:04:57.170> and<00:04:57.889> then<00:04:58.730> let's<00:04:58.910> talk

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
struck one barbarian and then let's talk

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:39.450 
struck one barbarian and then let's talk
assume<00:04:59.560> to<00:05:00.560> take<00:05:00.800> out<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.610> barbarian<00:05:02.180> King

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.120 

we're<00:05:40.060> getting<00:05:40.449> a<00:05:40.539> good<00:05:40.780> amount<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:41.110> gold<00:05:41.410> but

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
we're getting a good amount of gold but

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.779 
we're getting a good amount of gold but
the<00:05:42.850> elixir<00:05:43.509> there<00:05:44.319> seems<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.949> be<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:45.130> lot<00:05:45.400> fit

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
the elixir there seems to be a lot fit

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.140 
the elixir there seems to be a lot fit
in<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.180> storage<00:05:46.449> is<00:05:46.660> too<00:05:47.130> so<00:05:48.130> let's<00:05:48.759> see<00:05:48.940> if<00:05:49.030> we

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
in the storage is too so let's see if we

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.290 
in the storage is too so let's see if we
can<00:05:49.300> get<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.660> as<00:05:49.930> well<00:05:51.000> I'm<00:05:52.000> going<00:05:52.210> to

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
can get to that as well I'm going to

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.740 
can get to that as well I'm going to
drop<00:05:52.419> a<00:05:52.750> lot<00:05:53.169> of<00:05:53.259> troops<00:05:53.440> down<00:05:53.830> on<00:05:54.039> that<00:05:54.220> side

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
drop a lot of troops down on that side

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.360 
drop a lot of troops down on that side
so<00:05:55.750> that<00:05:55.960> they<00:05:56.229> can<00:05:56.380> take<00:05:56.530> out<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.830> text<00:05:57.099> us<00:05:57.250> as

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
so that they can take out the text us as

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.010 
so that they can take out the text us as
well<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.759> then<00:05:57.880> go<00:05:58.030> for<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.330> elixir<00:05:58.509> storage

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
well and then go for that elixir storage

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.230 
well and then go for that elixir storage
with<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.560> archer<00:05:59.919> tower

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.190 

looks<00:06:05.240> like<00:06:05.450> they're<00:06:05.630> doing<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.930> pretty<00:06:06.110> good

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
looks like they're doing a pretty good

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.900 
looks like they're doing a pretty good
job<00:06:06.350> getting<00:06:06.860> on<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.280> routine<00:06:07.640> here<00:06:08.590> so<00:06:09.910> the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
job getting on the routine here so the

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.120 
job getting on the routine here so the
other<00:06:11.030> ones<00:06:11.120> seem<00:06:11.570> really<00:06:11.930> well<00:06:12.290> protected<00:06:12.890> so

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
other ones seem really well protected so

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.780 
other ones seem really well protected so
let's<00:06:13.340> go<00:06:13.490> for<00:06:13.730> this<00:06:13.820> point<00:06:14.320> I'm<00:06:15.320> or<00:06:15.530> job<00:06:15.800> the

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
let's go for this point I'm or job the

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.740 
let's go for this point I'm or job the
rest<00:06:16.970> of<00:06:17.090> my<00:06:17.180> burpees

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.840 

then<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.320> rest<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.650> my<00:06:20.860> archers<00:06:21.250> come<00:06:21.580> on<00:06:21.700> with

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
then the rest of my archers come on with

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.970 
then the rest of my archers come on with
