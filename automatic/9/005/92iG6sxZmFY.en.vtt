Hi, guys. OK, so today, we're going to be looking at your look, 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:22.930
so how to look in photos, focusing on accessories and props.  

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.630
Let's jump into it, and focus in on your look, 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:49.450
and making your photos better.  

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.560
My first tip, is to have an accessory, or a prop, 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.960
that allows you to interact with it: 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.160
now, most people who pose for a photo 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
put their hands at their sides, like this.  

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.660
But if I have a prop to interact with, 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.270
all of a sudden, I have this long arm, 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.570
so, a beaded necklace for a lady is a really nice thing, 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.680
or, a pair of sunnies, for a guy, 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.810
I mean, this is really, it's really simple, 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.010
just those things, you probably already have them.  

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.210
And then you look relaxed, and when you look relaxed, you look photogenic.  

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:51.540
You look better in photos.  

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.740
My next tip is really, really fun, so grab your accessory, 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.250
it might be a nice, flowery headpiece, or a pair of sunnies, 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.040
and capture yourself in different poses.  

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.750
Having fun, laughing, looking serious, 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.270
and then, get all those photos, and pop them into a photo collage.  

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.570
So, present them as one photo.  

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.500
There's tons of websites out there, that have free collage programs, 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.180
and you can just pop them in it, it's really simple, 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:38.940
and then you have this amazing huge photo.  

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.810
A great tip that's always a winner, is, use an accessory, or a prop, 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.020
to enhance your eye color.  

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.740
So, you'll know your eye color, grab an accessory, 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.540
or a prop, that's similar in tone, and keep it near your face.  

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.160
Wonderful, wonderful thing to make your eyes sing. 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.570
Even a fedora, or a really elegant hat, for females, 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.580
and just take the photo.  

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.790
It can be a selfie, it could be a friend who takes a shot, 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.190
and, really, they're great for selfies, 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.890
because it's taking that small section, 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.710
and just ---bang! your eyes will just pop!  

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.730
