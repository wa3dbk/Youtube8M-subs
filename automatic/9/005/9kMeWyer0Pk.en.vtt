00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.560
 The first Volkswagen was a Mercedes 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.690
 only a bold statement by no means 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.270
 and these mercedes benz are classic 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.789
 The proof at the beginning of the 1930's 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.740
 automobiles were exclusively big and 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.810
 expensive and not only wanted the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.849
 well-heeled gentlemen but also too 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.009
 Mobilize the broad population 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.050
 long before in wolfsburg the first vw 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.699
 Mercedes already worked 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.769
 on a concept for a cheap and 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.869
 also designed for four people 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.089
 The developers put the dare for that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.810
 until then 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.879
 design principles on the head 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:55.960
 for the first time schwaben sold a 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:57.609
 four-cylinder and the 1934 had the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.710
 mercedes benz 130 on the 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.359

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.039
 Exhibition in Berlin Premiere 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.990
 the smallest and cheapest at the time 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.670
 Mercedes was only about four meters long 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.550
 and cost 3425 reichsmark 26 ps 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.200
 brought him to at least 92 tempo 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.050
 that time a peak 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.120
 although thought as a car for the people there was 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.280
 but a touch of luxury 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.620
 interior lighting warm air heating 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 cigar lighter and a car driver 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.350
 In addition one had the choice between one 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:45.340
 demo 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 a convertible and the tura version of the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 Type 130 was only two years old 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.940
 produced and sold about 4300 times 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 his successor the 170 h could only with 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.569
 1507 sold the copies in him 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.149
 not even set expectations 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.770
 approach to fill stuttgart's smallest 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.409
 Rear-wheel drive was still a milestone 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.659
 for mercedes even if the concept only 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:34.060
 around 60 years later the commercial one 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:36.730
 success brought the largest remains 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.860
 success of the type 130 the idea for 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 the smart of the oldtimer is the 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.700
 great-grandfather of the state fruits 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.939
 The dare for the people is truly 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.220
 never passed today less than ever because 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.629
