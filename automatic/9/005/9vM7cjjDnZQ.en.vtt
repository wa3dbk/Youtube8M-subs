00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.429
 carefully the fuchsia and we beat it 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.640
 on the whole eyelid 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.050
 with a flat brush 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.690
 here is how you can see 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.040
 and puppo seems an impossible tutorial with this color but I assure you that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.500
 in the end it will not be so 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.230
 because the transition color will continue to what you take and carry 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.050
 away also a color 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 shamps like this 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.270
 % of person with fair skin like mine 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.720
 and may have difficulty carrying 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.310
 this is called high school soft brush corset I may have difficulty in 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.699
 bring look like these is however nenni 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.289
 I have nothing compatible credit you see the finished you are really well 10 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.240
 for a bit of foresight this site 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.380
 then we take at this time has a brown color being 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.080
 slightly both with this very soft 3d folding brush for vienna 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.010
 and we begin to create depth 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 realm applying this brown color 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.430
 in April lock and nando awake the inside slightly 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 and starting to fade 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.320
 resumes soft brush site and that nuances and began 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 just soften the outer nuance 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.250
 this is the part that you always do with your eyes open by checking from a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.880
 eye to the other that forms come 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.270
 with which 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.490
 especially if you don't look at the same time 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 how mood is when you make a tutorial 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.470
 I love you cicciano 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.950

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.339
 and we begin to lightly illuminate the arch brow the interior 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.869
 you have eyes happenin tear duct 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:17.629
 apart from teasing the nuance we correct any errors 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:22.109
 deepen we need to deepen we raise the nuance 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.749
 we add octopuses I love one of the two colors according to the 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.909
 my best strengths you want to go to ours 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.209
 and we take a very common brown pencil I this commits of the 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.499

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.279
 to end 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.279
 is the upper lash line 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.399
 and I don't do it itself but we do a very quiet line though anyway 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.199
 find we do not leave this red color directly on the 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.749
 lash line 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.579
 because we don't want to create an effect of tired weighted fresh eye of 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.289
 crying and the same reason why 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.430
