Patrick's<00:00:16.260> Day<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:17.100> could<00:00:17.279> still<00:00:17.699> use<00:00:18.000> as

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
Patrick's Day you could still use as

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.720 
Patrick's Day you could still use as
always<00:00:19.619> you'll<00:00:19.859> want<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> begin<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.520> some

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
always you'll want to begin with some

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
always you'll want to begin with some
kind<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.000> base<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> be

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
kind of base and I'm just going to be

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
kind of base and I'm just going to be
using<00:00:22.740> my<00:00:22.830> Avon<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.760> usual<00:00:24.330> but

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
using my Avon one as usual but

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300 
using my Avon one as usual but
alternatively<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.500> could<00:00:25.619> use<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.830> green<00:00:26.099> base

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
alternatively you could use a green base

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.859 
alternatively you could use a green base
so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.970> something<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> NYX<00:00:27.779> jumbo

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
so it's something like a NYX jumbo

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.200 
so it's something like a NYX jumbo
pencil<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.619> work<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:29.039> well<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pencil would work really well and I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.730 
pencil would work really well and I
think<00:00:30.480> they<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> couple<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.260> good<00:00:31.439> green

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
think they have a couple of good green

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.400 
think they have a couple of good green
ones<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.120> could<00:00:33.300> try<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:34.140> mostly

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
ones so you could try that I'm mostly

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
ones so you could try that I'm mostly
going<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.710> using<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> Coastal<00:00:35.489> Scents<00:00:35.520> 2<00:00:35.969> v

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
going to be using the Coastal Scents 2 v

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.970 
going to be using the Coastal Scents 2 v
2<00:00:36.239> palette<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.899> look<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> can't<00:00:37.860> give

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
2 palette for this look so I can't give

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.410 
2 palette for this look so I can't give
you<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> exact<00:00:38.610> names<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> shadows

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you the exact names of the shadows

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.819 
you the exact names of the shadows
because<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.020> them<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.620> just

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
because they don't have them but just

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
because they don't have them but just
start<00:00:41.040> off<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> shimmer<00:00:42.030> green<00:00:42.270> shadow

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
start off with a shimmer green shadow

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049 
start off with a shimmer green shadow
like<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> mat<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.399> whichever

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
like this one or a mat just whichever

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
like this one or a mat just whichever
floats<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.420> boat<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.469> apply

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
floats your boat and then just apply

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.890 
floats your boat and then just apply
this<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.520> lid<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.910> begin<00:00:48.149> with

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.030 

then<00:00:52.900> you<00:00:53.140> just<00:00:53.320> want<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.530> take<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.710> darker

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
then you just want to take a darker

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.100 
then you just want to take a darker
green<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.550> apply<00:00:54.910> this<00:00:54.970> in<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.300> outer<00:00:55.480> V<00:00:55.630> and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
green and apply this in the outer V and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.350 
green and apply this in the outer V and
then<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.920> want<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.160> blend<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.670> across<00:00:57.910> onto

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
then you want to blend that across onto

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.030 
then you want to blend that across onto
the<00:00:58.450> lid<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:58.690> through<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.380> crease<00:00:59.620> with<00:00:59.980> a

fluffy<00:01:00.280> blending<00:01:00.820> brush<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.450> this<00:01:01.930> one<00:01:02.140> is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
fluffy blending brush and this one is

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.130 
fluffy blending brush and this one is
the<00:01:02.560> Sigma<00:01:02.950> e25<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.330> lot<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.600> people<00:01:04.870> ask<00:01:04.989> me

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the Sigma e25 and a lot of people ask me

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.440 
the Sigma e25 and a lot of people ask me
about<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.800> short<00:01:06.250> silver<00:01:06.670> blending<00:01:07.300> brush

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450

that<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.660> have<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.260> is<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.440> Sigma<00:01:08.890> e25<00:01:09.160> but<00:01:10.000> it's

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
that I have it is the Sigma e25 but it's

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.910 
that I have it is the Sigma e25 but it's
just<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.630> smaller<00:01:10.930> version<00:01:11.050> because<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.740> comes

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
just a smaller version because it comes

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.070 
just a smaller version because it comes
as<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> free<00:01:12.310> gift<00:01:12.520> sometimes<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:16.750> with<00:01:16.990> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
as a free gift sometimes going with the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.050 
as a free gift sometimes going with the
dark<00:01:17.260> green<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.710> intensify<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.370> outer<00:01:18.580> V<00:01:18.790> and

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
dark green to intensify the outer V and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.910 
dark green to intensify the outer V and
you<00:01:19.450> could<00:01:19.570> even<00:01:19.720> go<00:01:19.930> back<00:01:20.290> in<00:01:20.500> with<00:01:20.620> a<00:01:20.680> black

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
you could even go back in with a black

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920 
you could even go back in with a black
afterwards<00:01:21.490> if<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:21.910> wanted<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.300> super<00:01:22.600> dark

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930

afterwards if you wanted a super dark
and<00:01:22.990> intense<00:01:23.290> look<00:01:23.619> but<00:01:24.250> then<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:24.640> want

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
and intense look but then you just want

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.969 
and intense look but then you just want
to<00:01:25.000> blend<00:01:25.180> blend<00:01:25.479> blend<00:01:25.540> until<00:01:26.380> everything's

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
nicely blended together and not just

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.080 
nicely blended together and not just
random<00:01:30.340> patches<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.850> color<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:33.940> is

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
random patches of color now this is

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.999 
random patches of color now this is
something<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.630> just<00:01:34.660> tend<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.260> do<00:01:35.410> with<00:01:35.619> every
