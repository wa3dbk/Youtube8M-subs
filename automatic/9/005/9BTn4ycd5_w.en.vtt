00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
happiness but actually according to a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.660 
happiness but actually according to a
lot<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.540> research<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.650> now<00:00:17.220> let<00:00:17.400> me<00:00:17.520> be

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170

you<00:00:49.680> happiness<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> came<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.270> home

you happiness so then I came back home
and<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.719> decided<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> research<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> little

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and I decided to research it a little

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.459 
and I decided to research it a little
bit<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.610> actually<00:00:54.270> makes<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.719> happier<00:00:55.140> it's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bit what actually makes you happier it's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.500 
bit what actually makes you happier it's
not<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.890> stuff<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> buy<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
not the stuff that you buy but the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
not the stuff that you buy but the
experiences<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.770> have

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
experiences that you have

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
experiences that you have
I<00:00:59.399> don't<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.120> back<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> hall<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.289> had

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I don't think back to a hall that I had

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
I don't think back to a hall that I had
from<00:01:01.710> Target<00:01:02.250> three<00:01:02.520> years<00:01:02.760> ago<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
from Target three years ago and all the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
from Target three years ago and all the
stuff<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.899> bought<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> saying<00:01:05.250> in

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
stuff that I bought we have a saying in

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820 
stuff that I bought we have a saying in
my<00:01:05.549> family<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.420> things<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:07.110> old<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> break

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
my family that things get old and break

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
my family that things get old and break
but<00:01:08.549> experiences<00:01:09.360> grow<00:01:09.600> richer<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.110> better

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
but experiences grow richer and better

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440 
but experiences grow richer and better
the<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> tell<00:01:11.430> them<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.090> invest

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the more that you tell them so invest

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
the more that you tell them so invest
the<00:01:12.659> extra<00:01:12.810> money<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> in

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the extra money that you do have in

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
the extra money that you do have in
experiences<00:01:15.030> no<00:01:15.450> matter<00:01:15.630> how<00:01:15.930> much<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.530> how

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
experiences no matter how much or how

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
experiences no matter how much or how
little<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.610> invest<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> other

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
little you have to invest and the other

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
little you have to invest and the other
part<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> research<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.040> looking

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
part of the research that I was looking

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
part of the research that I was looking
at<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.909> saying<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> invest<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
at was saying that if you invest in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890 
at was saying that if you invest in
experiences<00:01:23.130> make<00:01:23.700> those<00:01:23.909> experiences<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
experiences make those experiences a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
experiences make those experiences a
treat<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.799> great<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.520> people<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
treat which is great for people on a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
treat which is great for people on a
budget<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.020> better<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
budget right it's better to go out to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.800 
budget right it's better to go out to
