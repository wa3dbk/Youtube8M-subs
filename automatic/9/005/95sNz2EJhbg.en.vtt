you<00:06:54.710> listen<00:06:54.919> to<00:06:55.449> the<00:06:56.449> exhaust<00:06:56.810> sounds<00:06:57.229> like

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.110 

and<00:07:02.890> it<00:07:03.010> does<00:07:03.160> not<00:07:03.340> have<00:07:03.550> catalytic

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
and it does not have catalytic

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.680 
and it does not have catalytic
converters<00:07:04.630> so<00:07:05.880> it<00:07:06.880> is<00:07:07.150> gonna<00:07:07.270> smell<00:07:07.630> like

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
converters so it is gonna smell like

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.110 
converters so it is gonna smell like
kind<00:07:08.470> of<00:07:08.530> an<00:07:08.680> older<00:07:09.040> muscle<00:07:09.400> car<00:07:09.610> which<00:07:10.090> is
