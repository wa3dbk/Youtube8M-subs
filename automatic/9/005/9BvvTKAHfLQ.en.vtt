00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.200

 this is the status of the connection of food tourism 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.459
 headset use 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.799
 P 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.469
 weâ€™ve been picking here 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.659
 Charger 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
 with the standard connector already 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.110

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.009

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.269
 very comfortably 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.310
 at 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.280
 since there is no extra charge 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.399
 the best 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.079
 they go sound to size 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.079
 okay more one panic 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.889
 Now the court will consider the headset itself. 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:01.680
 leg 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.569
 no one will come 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.569
 another drowned out 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.569
 This is how a headset looks 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.219
 all works 28 thousand 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.919
 very stylish 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.709
 nothing extra 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.829
 thin 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.869
 really 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.609
 looks very decent 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.609
 means on the front of the headset we 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.529
 club cube 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.339
 the answer 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.659
 call completion 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.620
 also on the case there are buttons 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.620
 volume control plus or minus 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.089
 on the back of the headset 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.609
 difficult button itself 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.939
 like this 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.299
 wholly 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.329
 Anna dog for wearing 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.049
 below the dynamics as we see are two 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.179
 the display we talked about level 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.589
 battery charge 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.589
 and bluetooth connection status 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.129
 now we will see how juicy it works 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.699
 this headset 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.669
 originally called push 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.779
 power button which are in 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.740
 top of the headset 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.779
 press this button and hold 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:32.159
 what we see 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.289
 headset we turned on 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.289
 we blink 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.690
 Bluetooth means it means that 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.690
 headset is in pairing mode 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 we take the phone 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.939
 our next step 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.379
 this is bluetooth headset detection 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.379
 phone 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.349
 phones 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.219
 not the headset jabra bt 20 80 we do not choose 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.879
 since the headset is present on the common 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.879
 used currency for 2 1 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.199
 Moscow telephone code to ask 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.490
 Basically the headset is ready 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.490
 to work 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.779
 but 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.219
 I want to say I am satisfied 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.159
 for his for his price 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.289
 headset policy 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.710
 very good 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.619
 apparently stylish design 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:09.269
 comfortable she really dreams 

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:10.309
