00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
covered up by that tag so I'm just

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.710

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
ended up not using them because I just

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.360 
ended up not using them because I just
don't<00:02:55.930> think<00:02:56.139> they<00:02:56.290> worked<00:02:56.530> with<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.919> circle

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.819 
but I'm going to use this circle sticker
that<00:02:59.319> says<00:02:59.530> property<00:02:59.799> of<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:01.530> i'm<00:03:02.530> going<00:03:02.739> to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
eye that has a seven on it I thought it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.309 
eye that has a seven on it I thought it
was<00:03:07.629> just<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.019> fun<00:03:08.680> way<00:03:08.889> to<00:03:08.919> add<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.639> date<00:03:10.319> so

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
was just a fun way to add the date so

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.470 
was just a fun way to add the date so
like<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.620> said<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.859> did<00:03:12.129> end<00:03:12.430> up<00:03:12.609> not<00:03:12.939> using<00:03:13.209> those

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
like I said I did end up not using those

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.940 
like I said I did end up not using those
brackets<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:14.139> just<00:03:14.319> going<00:03:14.439> to<00:03:14.470> put<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.799> back

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
brackets I'm just going to put that back

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.710 
brackets I'm just going to put that back
on<00:03:15.099> my<00:03:15.250> sticker<00:03:15.519> sheet<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.060> save<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.510> for

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
on my sticker sheet and save that for

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.649 
on my sticker sheet and save that for
another<00:03:16.750> time<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.549> moved<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.790> seven<00:03:19.389> around

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
another time I moved that seven around

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.080 
another time I moved that seven around
so<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.019> was<00:03:20.199> going<00:03:21.190> up<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.579> down<00:03:21.699> I<00:03:21.819> thought

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so it was going up and down I thought

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.369 
so it was going up and down I thought
that<00:03:22.269> looked<00:03:22.389> a<00:03:22.540> little<00:03:22.690> bit<00:03:22.840> better<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.260> I

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
that looked a little bit better and I

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.129 
that looked a little bit better and I
also<00:03:23.650> switched<00:03:24.159> out<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.400> letter<00:03:24.699> M<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.389> felt

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
also switched out the letter M I felt

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.399 
also switched out the letter M I felt
like<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:27.449> green<00:03:28.449> in<00:03:28.720> there<00:03:28.989> was<00:03:29.109> just<00:03:29.290> too

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
like the green in there was just too

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.309 
like the green in there was just too
much<00:03:29.440> green<00:03:29.889> there<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.569> now<00:03:31.720> I'm<00:03:31.870> ready<00:03:32.169> to

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319

that<00:04:11.049> they<00:04:11.169> would<00:04:11.319> be<00:04:11.470> fun<00:04:11.799> stamped<00:04:12.639> out<00:04:12.729> of

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
that they would be fun stamped out of

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.379 
that they would be fun stamped out of
bright<00:04:13.689> colors<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.470> i<00:04:14.909> started<00:04:15.909> with<00:04:16.090> green

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
bright colors and i started with green

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.629 
bright colors and i started with green
and<00:04:16.419> i<00:04:16.659> ended<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:17.139> liking<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:17.709> well<00:04:18.070> but

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
and i ended up not liking it so well but

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.819 
and i ended up not liking it so well but
i<00:04:18.699> did<00:04:19.090> do<00:04:19.269> an<00:04:19.389> orange<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:20.109> yellow<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.799> red

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
i did do an orange a yellow and a red

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.399 
i did do an orange a yellow and a red
and<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:22.300> I'm<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:22.450> simply<00:04:22.810> going<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.169> use

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
and then I'm just simply going to use

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.379 
and then I'm just simply going to use
the<00:04:23.620> coordinating<00:04:24.190> cloud<00:04:24.430> patches<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.120> punch

so<00:04:27.290> clouds<00:04:27.560> don't<00:04:27.830> always<00:04:28.100> have<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.460> be<00:04:28.639> you

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
so clouds don't always have to be you

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.000
