00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
course and in this building and I think

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.370 
course and in this building and I think
students<00:00:49.180> are<00:00:49.240> very<00:00:49.300> lucky<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.780> be<00:00:49.810> benefiting

from<00:00:50.410> them<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:51.130> decided<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.420> study<00:00:52.600> medicine

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
from them I decided to study medicine

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.110 
from them I decided to study medicine
because<00:00:53.470> I<00:00:53.590> think<00:00:53.650> I<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:54.070> needed<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.090> know

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
because I think I just needed to know

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.020 
because I think I just needed to know
more<00:00:55.360> about<00:00:55.780> life<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:57.070> know<00:00:57.190> I<00:00:57.220> knew<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.670> little

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
more about life you know I knew a little

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.690 
more about life you know I knew a little
part<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.900> life<00:00:59.440> prior<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.100> course<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.610> I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
part of life prior to the course and I

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.310 
part of life prior to the course and I
was<00:01:00.850> just<00:01:01.090> hungry<00:01:01.360> for<00:01:01.780> more<00:01:01.989> and

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
was just hungry for more and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.750 
was just hungry for more and
particularly<00:01:02.739> about<00:01:03.010> understanding<00:01:03.640> the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
particularly about understanding the

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.239 
particularly about understanding the
body<00:01:03.910> I<00:01:04.239> couldn't<00:01:04.869> get<00:01:04.989> away<00:01:05.079> from<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:05.770> it

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:06.249 
body I couldn't get away from it so it

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.209 
body I couldn't get away from it so it
haunted<00:01:06.670> me<00:01:06.729> until<00:01:07.299> I<00:01:07.390> faced<00:01:07.659> up<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:07.929> us

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
haunted me until I faced up to us

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.450 
haunted me until I faced up to us
there's<00:01:09.219> loads<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.729> things<00:01:09.789> in<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.929> I<00:01:10.990> found

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
there's loads of things in that I found

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.800 
there's loads of things in that I found
in<00:01:12.460> medicine<00:01:12.880> one<00:01:13.060> for<00:01:13.329> me<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.569> was<00:01:13.659> like

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
in medicine one for me it was like

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.330 
in medicine one for me it was like
climbing<00:01:14.259> Everest<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:14.920> it's<00:01:15.069> difficult

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
climbing Everest so it's difficult

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.239 
climbing Everest so it's difficult
there's<00:01:16.090> no<00:01:16.210> doubt<00:01:16.420> it's<00:01:16.780> demand<00:01:17.770> it's<00:01:18.039> very

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
there's no doubt it's demand it's very

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:21.690 
there's no doubt it's demand it's very
very<00:01:18.490> demanding<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:19.920> massively<00:01:20.920> important

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
very demanding and massively important

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.590 
very demanding and massively important
within<00:01:21.939> PBL<00:01:22.539> I<00:01:22.719> think<00:01:23.049> is<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.740> teamwork<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
within PBL I think is the teamwork so

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.149 
within PBL I think is the teamwork so
it's<00:01:25.719> very<00:01:25.869> like<00:01:26.109> the<00:01:26.229> world<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.560> work<00:01:26.770> really

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
it's very like the world of work really

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.980 
it's very like the world of work really
you<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.789> get<00:01:27.939> along<00:01:28.179> with<00:01:28.359> people<00:01:28.389> you

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
you have to get along with people you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.669 
you have to get along with people you
can't<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.409> go<00:01:29.530> home<00:01:29.709> to<00:01:29.950> your<00:01:29.979> bedroom<00:01:30.280> and

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
can't just go home to your bedroom and

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.379 
can't just go home to your bedroom and
study<00:01:32.679> up<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:32.979> books<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.819> amount<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.179> work

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
study up the books the amount of work

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
study up the books the amount of work
needed<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.209> that<00:01:37.389> way<00:01:37.539> would<00:01:37.869> be<00:01:37.929> near

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
needed to do it that way would be near

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.510 
needed to do it that way would be near
impossible<00:01:39.009> if<00:01:39.219> you<00:01:39.280> were<00:01:39.429> to<00:01:39.549> go<00:01:39.670> back<00:01:39.819> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
impossible if you were to go back to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.789 
impossible if you were to go back to
basic<00:01:42.520> textbooks<00:01:43.029> for<00:01:43.299> everything<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.740> you

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
basic textbooks for everything so you

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.590 
basic textbooks for everything so you
really<00:01:45.130> need<00:01:45.279> somebody<00:01:45.729> there<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:46.209> explain

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
really need somebody there to explain

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.190 
really need somebody there to explain

investigation<00:04:05.280> into<00:04:05.670> something<00:04:06.030> else<00:04:06.180> that's

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
investigation into something else that's

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.390 
investigation into something else that's
the<00:04:07.079> picture<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> little<00:04:07.860> bit<00:04:07.980> different<00:04:08.310> to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the picture is a little bit different to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.060 
the picture is a little bit different to
how<00:04:08.519> we<00:04:08.579> assumed<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.269> was<00:04:09.450> or<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:10.019> a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
how we assumed it was or you get a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.350 
how we assumed it was or you get a
better<00:04:11.070> view<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.610> something<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.299> a

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
better view of something you get a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.729 
better view of something you get a
different<00:04:12.690> angle<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:13.079> something<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.650> think

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
different angle on something so I think

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.600 
different angle on something so I think
that's<00:04:14.040> that's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
that's that's

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.130 
that's that's
that's<00:04:16.420> something<00:04:16.720> brilliant<00:04:16.900> about

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
that's something brilliant about

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.780 
that's something brilliant about
medicine<00:04:17.590> really<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.010> way<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.220> changes<00:04:18.610> all

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
medicine really the way it changes all

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.289 
medicine really the way it changes all
the<00:04:18.820> time

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
the time

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.180
