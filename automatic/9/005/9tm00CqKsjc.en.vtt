hi<00:00:01.350> everyone<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:02.159> I'm<00:00:02.580> so<00:00:02.790> sorry<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.300> not

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi everyone so I'm so sorry for not

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.740 
hi everyone so I'm so sorry for not
being<00:00:03.750> with<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.859> today<00:00:05.040> but<00:00:06.000> I'll<00:00:06.270> try<00:00:06.569> my

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
being with you today but I'll try my

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.830 
being with you today but I'll try my
best<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.140> clarify<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.540> clarify<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
best to clarify the clarify and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.240 
best to clarify the clarify and
introduce<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.980> concepts<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.080> so<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.980> we

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
introduce the concepts to you so what we

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.349 
introduce the concepts to you so what we
are<00:00:14.400> basically<00:00:14.700> doing<00:00:16.580> another<00:00:17.580> alternative

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
are basically doing another alternative

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
are basically doing another alternative
for<00:00:18.890> extracting<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:21.199> essential<00:00:22.199> oil<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
for extracting the essential oil or the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.349 
for extracting the essential oil or the
lipid<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.689> wax<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> rose<00:00:26.039> petals<00:00:26.519> is

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
lipid or the wax from the rose petals is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.020 
lipid or the wax from the rose petals is
that<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.840> will<00:00:28.080> use<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.880> supercritical<00:00:29.880> fluid

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.229 

so<00:00:33.030> what's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.540> supercritical<00:00:34.050> fluid

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
so what's a supercritical fluid

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.590 
so what's a supercritical fluid
basically<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> phase<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.570> not<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
basically it is a phase that is not a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
basically it is a phase that is not a
liquid<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> gas<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.640> liquid

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
liquid and not a gas but it has a liquid

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.790 
liquid and not a gas but it has a liquid
like<00:00:44.879> density<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:47.010> gas<00:00:47.370> flag<00:00:47.700> diffusivity

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
like density and a gas flag diffusivity

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
like density and a gas flag diffusivity
so<00:00:50.480> where<00:00:51.480> does<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.989> occur<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.149> phase

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so where does that occur in the phase

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.770 
so where does that occur in the phase
diagram<00:00:55.250> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.449> phase<00:00:57.660> diagram

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
diagram if you see in the phase diagram

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.560

and<00:00:58.500> decides<00:00:59.280> that<00:01:01.100> comes<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:03.149> super

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and decides that comes the super

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.020 
and decides that comes the super
critical<00:01:04.700> phase<00:01:05.990> supercritical<00:01:06.990> fluid<00:01:07.740> phase

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
critical phase supercritical fluid phase

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.750 
critical phase supercritical fluid phase
it<00:01:09.030> comes<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:10.070> certain<00:01:13.040> temperature<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it comes at a certain temperature and a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.080 
it comes at a certain temperature and a
certain<00:01:15.150> pressure<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.759> if

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
certain pressure so that as so that if

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
certain pressure so that as so that if
you<00:01:18.210> increase<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> pressure<00:01:19.020> and/or<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you increase the pressure and/or the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330 
you increase the pressure and/or the
temperature<00:01:21.119> after<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.810> point<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.280> be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
temperature after that point you will be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
temperature after that point you will be
still<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.600> supercritical<00:01:25.290> phase<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> an

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
still in this supercritical phase so an

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.560 
still in this supercritical phase so an
hour<00:01:28.189> extraction<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:29.880> carbon

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
hour extraction we are using carbon

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.830 
hour extraction we are using carbon
dioxide<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.579> for<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> carbon<00:01:33.000> dioxide<00:01:33.540> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
dioxide and for a carbon dioxide this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.950 
dioxide and for a carbon dioxide this
super<00:01:34.200> critical<00:01:34.439> phase<00:01:34.890> starts<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.960> thirty

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
super critical phase starts at thirty

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.429 
super critical phase starts at thirty
one<00:01:37.170> point<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.680> degree<00:01:38.040> Celsius<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.439> seventy

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.870 
one point one degree Celsius and seventy
three<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:41.009> eight<00:01:41.280> bar<00:01:43.310> what's<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.549> special

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
three point eight bar what's so special

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
three point eight bar what's so special
about<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:46.140> supercritical<00:01:47.720> carbon<00:01:48.720> dioxide

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
about the supercritical carbon dioxide

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.760 
about the supercritical carbon dioxide
phase<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:52.740> has<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.430> surface<00:01:53.820> tension

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
phase is that it has no surface tension

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.230 
phase is that it has no surface tension
so<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.210> will<00:01:57.210> help<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.780> lot

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240 

penetrating<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.710> fluid

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
penetrating and that the this fluid

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.969 
penetrating and that the this fluid
penetrating<00:02:03.909> in<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.439> petals<00:02:05.439> that<00:02:05.530> we<00:02:05.890> are

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
penetrating in the petals that we are

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.580 
penetrating in the petals that we are
using<00:02:07.619> another<00:02:08.619> thing<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:10.230> that<00:02:11.230> phase

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
using another thing is that that phase

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.930 
using another thing is that that phase
will<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.930> gas<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:14.230> diffusivity<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.730> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
will have a gas like diffusivity so that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.910 
will have a gas like diffusivity so that
will<00:02:16.150> help<00:02:17.370> going<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:19.650> diffusing<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
will help going in diffusing in the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.550 
will help going in diffusing in the
petals<00:02:21.280> very<00:02:22.269> fast<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.799> those<00:02:24.340> two<00:02:24.700> factors

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
petals very fast so those two factors

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.520 
petals very fast so those two factors
the<00:02:26.670> low<00:02:27.670> viscosity<00:02:28.440> disco<00:02:31.260> viscosity<00:02:32.260> sorry

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
the low viscosity disco viscosity sorry

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.150 
the low viscosity disco viscosity sorry
so<00:02:33.130> low<00:02:33.549> viscosity<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.470> no<00:02:35.470> surface<00:02:35.799> tension

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so low viscosity and no surface tension

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.280 
so low viscosity and no surface tension
in<00:02:36.549> addition<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.610> high<00:02:39.610> diffusivity

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
in addition to the high diffusivity

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.170 
in addition to the high diffusivity
those<00:02:41.290> two<00:02:42.360> will<00:02:43.360> make<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.840> extraction<00:02:45.180> much

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
those two will make the extraction much

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.740 
those two will make the extraction much
faster<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.860> now<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.610> see<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.180> process

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
faster so now if you see the process

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.130 
faster so now if you see the process

dioxide feed a chiller a pump that would

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.599 
dioxide feed a chiller a pump that would
increase<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.170> pressure<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:09.450> another<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:12.040> a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
course temperature we can decide what we

want to extract from those pedals do we

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.010 
want to extract from those pedals do we

want to extract the waxes or the lipids

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.460 
want to extract the waxes or the lipids
or<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:35.070> want<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.310> extract<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:36.320> essential<00:04:37.320> oil

or you want to extract the essential oil

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.210 
or you want to extract the essential oil
so<00:04:37.949> that<00:04:38.160> depends<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.830> temperature<00:04:40.830> and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
so that depends on the temperature and

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.020 
so that depends on the temperature and
pressure<00:04:41.669> but<00:04:42.000> here<00:04:42.720> let's<00:04:42.960> say<00:04:43.169> we<00:04:43.440> will

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
pressure but here let's say we will

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.100 
pressure but here let's say we will
extract<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.330> essential<00:04:45.810> oils<00:04:46.139> so<00:04:46.229> a<00:04:46.680> good

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
extract the essential oils so a good

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.960 
extract the essential oils so a good
temperature<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.260> 50<00:04:49.680> degree<00:04:49.919> Celsius<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.580> a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
temperature is 50 degree Celsius and a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.620 
temperature is 50 degree Celsius and a
good<00:04:51.090> pressure<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.539> about<00:04:51.780> 105<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.630> then

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
good pressure is about 105 and then

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.310 
good pressure is about 105 and then
after<00:04:55.139> leaves<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.889> extractor<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.960> pressure

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
after leaves the extractor the pressure

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.090 
after leaves the extractor the pressure
will<00:04:58.770> be<00:04:58.800> decreased<00:04:59.660> so<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.949> there<00:05:01.949> will<00:05:02.070> be

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
will be decreased so that there will be

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.100 
will be decreased so that there will be
a<00:05:02.550> high<00:05:03.260> relative<00:05:04.260> volatility<00:05:04.919> between<00:05:04.949> the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
a high relative volatility between the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.430 
a high relative volatility between the
oil<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:08.520> was<00:05:08.760> extracted<00:05:09.479> and<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:10.020> carbon

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
oil that was extracted and the carbon

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.969 
oil that was extracted and the carbon
dioxide<00:05:11.360> which<00:05:12.360> will<00:05:12.539> basically<00:05:12.750> make<00:05:13.289> the

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
dioxide which will basically make the

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.870 
dioxide which will basically make the
carbon<00:05:14.460> dioxide<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.690> turn<00:05:15.900> vapor<00:05:16.880> or

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
carbon dioxide and turn vapor or

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.190 
carbon dioxide and turn vapor or
basically<00:05:18.210> it's<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.630> vapor<00:05:18.930> liquid

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
basically it's a vapor liquid

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.860 
basically it's a vapor liquid
equilibrium<00:05:19.880> which<00:05:20.880> will<00:05:21.090> make<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.479> carbon

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
equilibrium which will make the carbon

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.980 
equilibrium which will make the carbon
dioxide<00:05:22.289> turned<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.680> vapor<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.250> then<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
dioxide turned to vapor and then the

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.210 
dioxide turned to vapor and then the
essential<00:05:24.990> oil<00:05:25.169> would<00:05:25.410> be<00:05:25.530> collected<00:05:25.979> into

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
essential oil would be collected into

considered<00:06:11.070> hazard<00:06:11.490> when<00:06:11.699> compared<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.380> like

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
considered hazard when compared to like

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.659 
considered hazard when compared to like
contaminating<00:06:14.970> water<00:06:15.000> with<00:06:15.599> hexane

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
contaminating water with hexane

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.739 
contaminating water with hexane
so<00:06:17.300> it's<00:06:18.199> just<00:06:18.349> not<00:06:19.030> environmentally<00:06:20.030> hazard

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:20.749 
so it's just not environmentally hazard

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.189 
so it's just not environmentally hazard
as<00:06:21.439> it<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:21.770> also<00:06:22.689> because<00:06:23.689> of<00:06:23.719> the<00:06:23.990> load

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
as it is also because of the load

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.159 
as it is also because of the load
typically<00:06:24.949> low<00:06:25.159> temperature<00:06:25.699> it<00:06:26.599> doesn't

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
typically low temperature it doesn't

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.779 
typically low temperature it doesn't
degrade<00:06:27.949> the<00:06:29.409> the<00:06:30.409> chemicals<00:06:30.919> that<00:06:31.039> is<00:06:31.370> in<00:06:31.580> the

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
degrade the the chemicals that is in the

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:38.769 
degrade the the chemicals that is in the
essential<00:06:32.300> oil<00:06:33.819> also<00:06:35.409> it<00:06:36.409> has<00:06:37.569> low<00:06:38.569> energy

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:38.779 
essential oil also it has low energy

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:45.119 
essential oil also it has low energy
cost<00:06:39.529> and<00:06:40.060> the<00:06:41.060> energy<00:06:41.569> is<00:06:41.979> me<00:06:42.979> saved<00:06:43.430> in<00:06:44.090> the

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
cost and the energy is me saved in the

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.939 
cost and the energy is me saved in the
process<00:06:46.129> on<00:06:47.060> the<00:06:47.509> other<00:06:47.659> hand<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.620> distance

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
process on the other hand the distance

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.800 
process on the other hand the distance
and<00:06:49.129> this<00:06:49.340> advantages<00:06:49.909> are<00:06:50.389> two<00:06:50.659> main

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
and this advantages are two main

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.300 
and this advantages are two main
advantages<00:06:51.139> that<00:06:51.650> are<00:06:51.740> connected<00:06:52.189> to<00:06:52.279> each

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
advantages that are connected to each

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.540 
advantages that are connected to each
other<00:06:52.550> the<00:06:53.270> first<00:06:53.449> one<00:06:53.750> is<00:06:53.960> that<00:06:54.069> it<00:06:55.069> requires

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
other the first one is that it requires

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.379 
other the first one is that it requires
very<00:06:56.300> high<00:06:56.449> technology<00:06:57.319> which<00:06:57.979> will<00:06:58.389> generate

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
very high technology which will generate

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:05.649 
very high technology which will generate
very<00:07:00.229> high<00:07:00.289> pressures<00:07:00.949> and<00:07:01.569> also<00:07:04.029> so<00:07:05.029> this

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:05.659 
very high pressures and also so this

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.079 
very high pressures and also so this
this<00:07:06.469> high<00:07:06.680> technology<00:07:06.919> is<00:07:07.400> that<00:07:07.580> accessible

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.089 
this high technology is that accessible

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.450 
this high technology is that accessible
to<00:07:08.270> many<00:07:08.419> countries<00:07:09.259> especially<00:07:09.680> those<00:07:10.159> poor

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
to many countries especially those poor

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.760 
to many countries especially those poor
countries<00:07:10.849> in<00:07:11.779> addition<00:07:12.199> those<00:07:12.949> high<00:07:13.400> tech

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
countries in addition those high tech

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.079 
countries in addition those high tech
those<00:07:15.770> high<00:07:15.979> tech<00:07:16.219> devices<00:07:16.580> are<00:07:17.029> very

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.089 
those high tech devices are very

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:22.439 
those high tech devices are very
expensive<00:07:17.770> so<00:07:18.770> it<00:07:19.339> will<00:07:19.520> make<00:07:20.589> the<00:07:21.589> startup<00:07:22.099> of

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
expensive so it will make the startup of

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.429 
expensive so it will make the startup of
buying<00:07:23.449> those<00:07:23.900> equipment<00:07:24.939> a<00:07:26.229> very<00:07:27.229> tough

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
buying those equipment a very tough

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:32.019 
buying those equipment a very tough
thing<00:07:27.469> compared<00:07:28.250> to<00:07:28.460> other<00:07:28.759> methods<00:07:30.400> so<00:07:31.400> this

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:32.029 
thing compared to other methods so this

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:35.709 
thing compared to other methods so this
is<00:07:32.180> all<00:07:32.389> about<00:07:32.539> these<00:07:32.990> supercritical<00:07:34.719> carbon

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:35.719 
is all about these supercritical carbon

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:39.969 
is all about these supercritical carbon
dioxide<00:07:36.669> extraction<00:07:38.439> so<00:07:39.439> thank<00:07:39.680> you<00:07:39.800> for

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:39.979 
dioxide extraction so thank you for

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.409 
dioxide extraction so thank you for
listening<00:07:40.099> and<00:07:40.639> I<00:07:41.539> don't<00:07:41.899> like<00:07:42.050> the<00:07:42.229> rest
