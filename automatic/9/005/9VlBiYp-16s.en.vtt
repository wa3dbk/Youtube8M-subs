00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 Hello everyone in this lesson we will analyze 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.770
 it is the reef itself from the song because 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 rhythm there is basically not difficult and possible 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.610
 find chords online 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.279
 it's all easy to do and here it is with 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.720
 reef is more complicated and by the way I will say that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 songs played in a drop 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.050
 and that is, the dropship is normal 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.660
 guitar so do not lower need thick 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 strings first i'll just play all in 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 slow pace maybe someone and so 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.149
 understand and then to those who did not understand and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.149
 already in more detail we will sort everything 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.540
 so hold the index finger 4 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.060
 the string on the seventh fret we play three times 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.440
 then we clamp it 4 strings on the tenth 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 year we play three more times 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.360
 further we clamp better with the middle finger 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.439
 second string on the eighth fret 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.439
 play two times 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.219
 then the little finger clamp the same second 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.219
 string on the tenth fret and play 8 times 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.840
 so at the same time 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.840
 this is the first part 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.490
 further the second part the second part 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.149
 starts exactly the same on the seventh fret 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.340
 three times 10 one three times further 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.070
 go to the second string on the eighth 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.909
 fret also play twice 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.240
 then 10 more two times then go 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.160
 on the first string in the seventh fret play 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.970
 twice 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.430
 back to 10 watts 2 strings 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 two times and 8 watts two times 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.930
 divide this second piece better 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:26.879
 another two ADVANCED I here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.879
 1 part and 2 part will turn out 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.970
 explain again on the second string 8 by 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.950
 two times all 10 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.860
 then on the first string 7 back 10 by 2 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.450
 and 8 and it all starts again 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.020
 so let's play the second part 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.020
 completely 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.420
 now let's all play from the beginning to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.420
 end and 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:11.879
 and gave this reef the entire song repeated on 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.430
