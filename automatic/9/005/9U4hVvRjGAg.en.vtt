okay guys I thought we were done with
the<00:00:03.300> wheel<00:00:03.480> seals<00:00:04.970> so<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.029> guess<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.690> going

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the wheel seals so I guess this is going

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.750 
the wheel seals so I guess this is going
to<00:00:06.930> be<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> wheel<00:00:07.170> seal<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.400> gonna<00:00:08.610> be<00:00:08.700> a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
to be a wheel seal for it's gonna be a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.220 
to be a wheel seal for it's gonna be a
short<00:00:08.970> video<00:00:09.210> but<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.660> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> lead<00:00:10.019> into

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
short video but it's going to lead into

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.839

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
when the weight of the tiller is sitting

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.990 
when the weight of the tiller is sitting
on<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
on it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.200 
on it
it<00:00:45.840> holds<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> shaft<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> leaking

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it holds the shaft up and all is leaking

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
it holds the shaft up and all is leaking
out<00:00:48.329> underneath<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> shaft<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.469> between<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
out underneath the shaft in between the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.720 
out underneath the shaft in between the
seal<00:00:50.899> what<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.020> thinking<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
seal what I'm thinking is that the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
seal what I'm thinking is that the
bearings<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:56.219> housing<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.690> shot<00:00:58.140> where

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
bearings in the housing are shot where

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.349 
bearings in the housing are shot where
the<00:00:59.460> seals<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.910> bad<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.449> dirt<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:02.210> excuse<00:01:03.210> me

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the seals are bad with dirt in excuse me

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.219 
the seals are bad with dirt in excuse me
hate<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.719> bronze<00:01:04.049> bushings<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:06.229> now

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
hate up bronze bushings in there and now

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
hate up bronze bushings in there and now
they're<00:01:07.380> raised<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.920> too<00:01:08.130> high<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.820> allowing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
they're raised up too high and allowing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
they're raised up too high and allowing
all<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> come<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.020> underneath<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
all to come out from underneath of it so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
all to come out from underneath of it so
we're<00:01:11.220> gonna<00:01:11.340> tear<00:01:11.580> into<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> little

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
we're gonna tear into it here a little

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.190 
we're gonna tear into it here a little
bit<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:14.090> see<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.360> truly<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> case<00:01:15.840> and

seals not new seal but new bushings and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.850 
seals not new seal but new bushings and
probably<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.020> new<00:01:22.170> bearings<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.710> got

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
probably some new bearings it's got

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.060 
probably some new bearings it's got
roller<00:01:23.070> bearings<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> front<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> back

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
roller bearings in the front in the back

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.260 
roller bearings in the front in the back
shims<00:01:26.180> there's<00:01:27.180> quite<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:28.040> going<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.909> here

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
shims there's quite a bit going on here

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.940

and we're gonna tear into it see what we

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.690 
and we're gonna tear into it see what we
can<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.500> make<00:01:37.500> videos<00:01:38.100> called

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
can do and make videos called
