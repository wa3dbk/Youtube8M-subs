 of paint reducing bottleneck 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.140
 of jobs in the booth to paint it 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.640
 here's how when the pollutants in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 the air is deposited on the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.439
 freshly painted surfaces is necessary 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.600
 additional time to sand for 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.850

 of the largest investments of his workshop 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.100
 the paint booth also caught 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.470
 dirt reduces the need for 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 Daily maintenance and newspaper all 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.290
 We know how to clean scrape and repaint 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.990
 can affect valuable productivity 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.690
 and washing repeatedly introduces moisture 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.110
 that favors oxidation and healing 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.090
