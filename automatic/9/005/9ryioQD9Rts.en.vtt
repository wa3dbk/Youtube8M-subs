00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.650
 from minecraft and today I bring you the review 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.420
 of the 12 of 38 and if yesterday it left the 38 a. 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.970
 but they have updated some 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.150
 little things are worth they have already put some 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.739
 nonsense and I wanted to mention them like that 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.890
 let's see them 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.050
 the command bars and it works works like this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.050
 what if I put the bar 6 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.770
 will put me there and also put 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.750
 bar command sg m which is like a 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.740
 private message then you put the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.100
 name of the person you want and say 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.040
 I have ton reds so in traffic plan 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.990
 reston and he does not leave me because I can not 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.730
 send me a message but 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.010
 you can the name in a 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.340
 server where they would do more than one person 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.300
 and you're guys that very new command 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.820
 well the witches 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.830
 now they have drops and they can drop the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.619
 sticks can let us loose gunpowder rest 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.150
 lose are sugar can also drop 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.479
 empty bottles or you can not let go 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.460
 with water and also spider eyes the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.460

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.229
 the king is still dropping in the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.060
 instant life position have 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.860
 updated some sounds but it 's more 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.979
 important is that they have added a sound 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.979
 to the main card so let's hear it 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.790
 personally I love this sound of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.350
 the best ones that have added the del 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.200
 understand man and the main card 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.720
 simply great and to finish 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.060
 a quite radical change that I 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.120
 forgot yesterday but you had it in the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.820
 description so here you see all the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.459
 groups like stone not good it is 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.930

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.739
