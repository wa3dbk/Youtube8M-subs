00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
mostly a standard v8 Vantage this is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
mostly a standard v8 Vantage this is
primarily<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.320> v8<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> has<00:00:50.039> been<00:00:50.190> made<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> go

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
primarily a v8 that has been made to go

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
primarily a v8 that has been made to go
racing<00:00:51.030> rather<00:00:51.360> than<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.600> race<00:00:51.750> car<00:00:51.930> that's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

lot<00:01:23.430> easier<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.970> think<00:01:24.299> over<00:01:24.540> 24<00:01:24.869> hours<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.200> drove

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
lot easier I think over 24 hours I drove

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.070

this car on Monday that the old

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980 
this car on Monday that the old
Nurburgring<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.939> makes<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:30.390> easy<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
Nurburgring and it makes it very easy to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.480 
Nurburgring and it makes it very easy to
drive<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.650> sit<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.369> got

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490

the paddles you don't need to take your

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.609 
the paddles you don't need to take your
