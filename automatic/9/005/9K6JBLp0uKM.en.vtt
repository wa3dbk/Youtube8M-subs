00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.809
 how about friends one more time I'm your friend 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.490
 I gales and this video is for you to 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.870
 you just start in this fascinating 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.870
 world in the province 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.180
 there are some idioms or things that sometimes 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.950
 we say that a lot of people have told me and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.410
 that rocky thing and pinched him and 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.340
 let's do it until the cause and 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.880
 we make a bubble and we come back with this 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.150
 profile and we look at it 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.620
 would be commonly used as named 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.950
 as a bear's ear 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.740
 and 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.100
 ear does not behave because it has the 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.489
 form of a song 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.949
 next there is an idiom that we use 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.570
 in violence that is petal of a 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.450
 petal we bend it and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.400
 we turn it this is a method that 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:11.100
 forms the shape of a petal and is used 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.690
 enough to numancy 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.250
 other 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.250
 many call him this 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.330
 Let's see 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.260
 how to pass through another 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.750
 here it was cut short because what we do is 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.110
 press our balloon there are the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.110
 let's go 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.890
 and already that bubble is less tense 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.550
 what follows we press 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.550
 sometimes 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 he does not say it but that's how it is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.930
 we press and do 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.090
 another bubble and let's go through here 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.759
 while you will win but you are in advance 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.909
 are already less tense and the one that follows 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.370
 same as I was distracted the front distracted 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.530
 but here and here to save 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.100
 very easily as it is also 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.820
 he held we put through our 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.820
 first two streaks 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.060
 as well 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.740
 thank you very much for watching to see this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.740
 video and until next time
