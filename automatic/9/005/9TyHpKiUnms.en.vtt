00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.440
 press any key and win here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 main slogan of the new keyboard 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.759
 steelseries apex ra and it is no coincidence 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 black matte rookie in a row 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.839
 Keyboards equipped with 17 additional 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 buttons each of which can 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.289
 execute two different commands and this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.289
 far from all its virtues 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 despite the apparent must difference 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.020
 new keyboard is not that big 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 this illusion creates an extra row 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.920
 keys on the left and a big padla this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 region 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.180
 keyboard case is made of matte 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.920
 plastic but the area between the buttons 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.649
 the glossy buttons themselves are also matte 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.579
 with their fingers just do not how many times too to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.070
 we started about buttons 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.940
 Immediately tell about the most interesting 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.770
 extra keys 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 five of them are located here as well 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.870
 12 more took place under the functional 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 buttons so that during the game they accidentally 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 don't confuse the developers did 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.780
 extra keys higher them 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 easy to find with your hands even though 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.729
 the keyboard in the left corner is such l 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 key to create two layers 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.450
 macro so that in total 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.400
 steelseries apex offers thirty 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.110
 four commands for macros this should 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.490
 enough for even the most avid lovers 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.680
 Horn cards games 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 but just on increasing the amount 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.700
 buttons for additional commands 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.080
 steelseries do not stop hand 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.790
 the unit also upgraded 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 there are two additional buttons 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.930
 to move diagonally 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 another innovation has affected the zone 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.740
 next to the unusual shape is a space now 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.630
 here instead of the windows key is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.729
 it is precisely the steelseries button 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.500
 with it you can control audio 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.220
 player and keyboard backlight brightness 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 The thing is quite convenient and practical and 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.690
 by the way about the backlight she's here spartan 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.160
 white is nothing extra simple and neat 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.650
 john has just the side surfaces 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.080
 apex ro don't shine like u more expensive 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.119
 versions using the steelseries button 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.040
 you can do one more thing quickly 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.110
 block the hated for many 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.550
 gamers blame button just simultaneously 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 press both buttons and during the game 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.789
 you will never see a popup in 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.979
 lower left corner start panel 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.899
 Well, the last thing in the revolution 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.060
 buttons have become two small influxes on 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.430
 w buttons this is very handy if hand 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.440
 suddenly slipped off the wsd block 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.180
 you will be able to quickly find these nodules and 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.000
 continue playing without taking your eyes off 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.800
 screen to tune the keyboard 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.750
 programming macros and other things 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.530
 Of course you need to use corporate 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.390
 about steelseries 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
 however even without installing jane 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.959
 the keyboard can easily perform 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 my job 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.560
 despite its gaming roots apex 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.450
 it will be quite comfortable and everyday 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.190
 working with a computer course she buttons 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.930
 soft enough short tekke 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 and also complete with keyboard 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.370
 shipped and here are such interchangeable 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.780
 rubber feet are slightly taller than the base 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.329
 so if desired angle of inclination 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.579
 keyboards can be changed in steelseries 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.290
 apex po has some serious 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.450
 merits and at the same time the price tag on it 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.920
 fairly democratic it is great 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.600
 an option for those who do not need extra 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 backlight settings connectors 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.140
 transformable blocks and stuff but just 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.489
 need performance and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.489
 pure functionality
