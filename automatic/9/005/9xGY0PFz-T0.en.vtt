this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.369> red-eyed<00:00:17.789> tree<00:00:17.820> frog<00:00:20.720> it's

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this is the red-eyed tree frog it's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.099 
this is the red-eyed tree frog it's
blood<00:00:22.080> red<00:00:22.289> eyes<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.859> make<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.160> stand<00:00:23.580> out

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
blood red eyes really make it stand out

blood red eyes really make it stand out
which<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.380> always<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> good<00:00:25.980> thing<00:00:26.279> for

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
which is not always a good thing for

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.980 
which is not always a good thing for
something<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.939> bite-sized

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.630 

but<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.170> species<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> frog<00:00:32.009> has<00:00:32.250> been<00:00:32.399> around

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
but this species of frog has been around

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.750

for<00:00:32.880> millions<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.480> years

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760

so<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.210> made<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> far<00:00:43.010> what

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
so how has it made it this far what

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
so how has it made it this far what
tricks<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.550> evolution<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.270> allowed<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
tricks of evolution have allowed it to

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
different ways it adapted a leafy green

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.840 
different ways it adapted a leafy green
color<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.550> help<00:03:51.730> while<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.240> sleeping<00:03:53.850> the

color to help while it is sleeping the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.820

benefits<00:03:55.270> of<00:03:55.360> camouflage<00:03:55.840> are<00:03:56.170> essentially

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
benefits of camouflage are essentially

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.800 
benefits of camouflage are essentially
not<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.130> be<00:03:57.220> seen<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.120> be<00:03:58.240> able<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.570> hide

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
not to be seen it is to be able to hide

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.350 
not to be seen it is to be able to hide
in<00:03:59.050> plain<00:03:59.080> sight<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:03.550> can<00:04:03.730> benefit<00:04:04.120> either

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
in plain sight this can benefit either

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.390 
in plain sight this can benefit either
those<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.530> are<00:04:05.650> trying<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.130> hide<00:04:06.250> from

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
those that are trying to hide from

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.070 
those that are trying to hide from
predators<00:04:06.490> or<00:04:07.090> those<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.540> may<00:04:07.660> be<00:04:07.690> predators

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
predators or those that may be predators

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.660 
predators or those that may be predators
themselves<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:08.920> trying<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.190> hide<00:04:09.280> from<00:04:09.460> their

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
themselves and trying to hide from their

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.500 
themselves and trying to hide from their
prey<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:12.280> idea<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:12.610> camouflage<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.150> to

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
prey so the idea of camouflage is to

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.300 
prey so the idea of camouflage is to
look<00:04:13.690> like<00:04:13.900> one's<00:04:14.110> background<00:04:17.100> in<00:04:18.100> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
look like one's background in the

can see me this may act to deter the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
Predators either because it's like a

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.890 
Predators either because it's like a

or<00:05:08.810> two<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.200> avoid<00:05:09.590> being<00:05:09.890> eaten<00:05:10.070> or<00:05:10.610> in<00:05:10.940> fact

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
or two to avoid being eaten or in fact

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.970 
or two to avoid being eaten or in fact
it<00:05:11.330> could<00:05:11.480> be<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.720> mimicry<00:05:12.200> where<00:05:12.500> it<00:05:12.860> is

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
it could be a mimicry where it is

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.040 
it could be a mimicry where it is

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
fact it is not but can the red-eyed tree

frog<00:05:19.370> trick<00:05:19.730> predators<00:05:20.240> in<00:05:20.360> other<00:05:20.480> ways<00:05:21.820> one

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
frog trick predators in other ways one

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.880 
frog trick predators in other ways one
theory<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.480> after<00:05:23.960> jumping<00:05:24.290> away<00:05:24.590> its

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
theory is that after jumping away its

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
theory is that after jumping away its
colors<00:05:25.460> leave<00:05:25.670> an<00:05:25.790> image<00:05:26.090> of<00:05:26.210> itself<00:05:26.570> behind

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
colors leave an image of itself behind

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.760 
colors leave an image of itself behind
causing<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.030> attacker<00:05:29.420> to<00:05:29.720> lurch<00:05:29.990> at<00:05:30.140> a<00:05:30.200> ghost
