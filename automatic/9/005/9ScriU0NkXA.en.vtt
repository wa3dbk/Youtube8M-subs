done so many many times but the reason
they<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.770> such<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
they do this is because it is such a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.340 
they do this is because it is such a
formidable<00:02:23.490> weapon<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> team<00:02:25.320> of

there's a solar burn well it's basically

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
there's a solar burn well it's basically
game<00:02:32.100> over<00:02:32.370> before<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.880> fight<00:02:33.060> even<00:02:33.090> begun

game over before the fight even begun

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.720 
game over before the fight even begun
but<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> already<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
but you already know this you know the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.550 
but you already know this you know the
other<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.180> good<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:36.870> why<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.140> want<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
other one is good that's why you want it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.010 
other one is good that's why you want it
so<00:02:38.280> let's<00:02:38.850> talk<00:02:38.970> about<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.240> briefly<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.690> both<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
so let's talk about it briefly as both a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.640 
so let's talk about it briefly as both a
PvE<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.830> PvP<00:02:41.370> weapon<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.120> PvE<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.410> goes

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
PvE and a PvP weapon in PvE it goes

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
PvE and a PvP weapon in PvE it goes
without<00:02:43.920> saying<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.880> slayer<00:02:45.360> provided

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
without saying this is a slayer provided

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.870 
without saying this is a slayer provided
you<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.350> ammo<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> good<00:02:47.489> weapon<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
you have ammo this is a good weapon to

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.910 
you have ammo this is a good weapon to
carry<00:02:48.150> into<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.420> boss<00:02:48.570> battle<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.590> probably

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
carry into a boss battle it's probably

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.290 
carry into a boss battle it's probably
not<00:02:49.980> worth<00:02:50.160> using<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:50.610> much<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.000> smaller

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
not worth using so much on smaller

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.210 
not worth using so much on smaller
groups<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.630> enemies<00:02:51.900> sure<00:02:52.500> it'll<00:02:52.950> do<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.190> job

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
groups of enemies sure it'll do the job

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.010 
groups of enemies sure it'll do the job
but<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.150> we'll<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.420> dead<00:02:54.600> before<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
but then we'll be dead before the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.390 
but then we'll be dead before the
Wolfpack<00:02:55.320> rounds<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.680> even<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.160> thing

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
Wolfpack rounds can even do that thing

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.150 
Wolfpack rounds can even do that thing
so<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.150> worth<00:02:57.300> saving<00:02:57.570> your<00:02:57.750> ammo<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:59.010> what

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
so it's worth saving your ammo but what

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.390 
so it's worth saving your ammo but what
about<00:02:59.370> PvP<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.660> thing<00:03:00.840> about<00:03:01.020> PvP<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:02.190> as

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
about PvP the thing about PvP is that as

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.040 
about PvP the thing about PvP is that as
you're<00:03:02.580> honored<00:03:02.760> I'll<00:03:02.910> wear<00:03:03.180> heavy<00:03:03.720> ammo

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
you're honored I'll wear heavy ammo

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.990 
you're honored I'll wear heavy ammo
usually<00:03:04.530> only<00:03:04.709> comes<00:03:05.070> around<00:03:05.370> twice<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.670> match

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
usually only comes around twice a match

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880 
usually only comes around twice a match
which<00:03:06.600> means<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.320> bring<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.650> into<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
which means if you bring this into the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.550 
which means if you bring this into the
crucible<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.670> useless<00:03:09.090> for<00:03:09.450> about<00:03:09.810> 80%<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
crucible it's useless for about 80% of a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.070 
crucible it's useless for about 80% of a
match<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:11.700> being<00:03:11.940> said<00:03:12.150> when<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.900> have

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
match that being said when you do have

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.990 
match that being said when you do have
heavy<00:03:13.260> ammo<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.980> obviously<00:03:14.400> an<00:03:14.580> effective

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
heavy ammo it is obviously an effective

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.850 
heavy ammo it is obviously an effective
killer<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:15.989> then<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.440> any<00:03:16.590> rocket

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
killer but then so is any rocket

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.350 
killer but then so is any rocket
launcher<00:03:17.160> provided<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.880> land<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> hit

the<00:03:19.170> tracking<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.620> useful<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.250> shooting<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the tracking is useful when shooting a

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.729 
the tracking is useful when shooting a
fleeing<00:03:20.910> enemy<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.810> if<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.200> want<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.440> tracking

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
fleeing enemy but if you want a tracking

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.080 
fleeing enemy but if you want a tracking
rocket<00:03:22.980> launcher<00:03:23.250> for<00:03:23.459> use<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> crucible

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
rocket launcher for use in the crucible

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.000

then<00:03:24.690> you're<00:03:24.840> far<00:03:25.110> better<00:03:25.140> off<00:03:25.440> using<00:03:25.620> truth

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
then you're far better off using truth

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.250 
then you're far better off using truth
it<00:03:26.489> tracks<00:03:26.820> far<00:03:27.030> more<00:03:27.150> aggressively<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it tracks far more aggressively and the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
much more suited to crucible play so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.610 
much more suited to crucible play so
