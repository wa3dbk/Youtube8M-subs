00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
out of this car and I got out and I went

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.490 
out of this car and I got out and I went
in<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.330> said<00:05:15.539> hi<00:05:15.720> how<00:05:16.080> are<00:05:16.139> you<00:05:16.319> today

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.529 
in and I said hi how are you today
simply<00:05:17.340> would<00:05:17.699> not<00:05:17.879> speak<00:05:18.180> because<00:05:18.509> they

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
simply would not speak because they

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.390 
simply would not speak because they
would<00:05:18.780> have<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.110> dog<00:05:19.379> because<00:05:20.159> I<00:05:20.219> didn't

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
would have that dog because I didn't

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.589 
would have that dog because I didn't
want<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.550> draw<00:05:20.729> any<00:05:20.789> attention<00:05:20.909> to<00:05:21.330> myself

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
want to draw any attention to myself

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.600 
want to draw any attention to myself
because<00:05:22.409> the<00:05:22.500> dog<00:05:22.680> would<00:05:22.860> then<00:05:23.009> pay<00:05:23.219> attention

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
because the dog would then pay attention

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.189 
because the dog would then pay attention
to<00:05:23.729> me

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.320 

we<00:05:29.069> cannot<00:05:29.340> typically<00:05:29.669> would<00:05:29.939> because<00:05:30.240> I

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
we cannot typically would because I

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.480 
we cannot typically would because I
would<00:05:30.509> be<00:05:30.659> fearful<00:05:30.960> better<00:05:31.349> that<00:05:32.099> they<00:05:32.250> would

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
would be fearful better that they would

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.459 
would be fearful better that they would
they<00:05:32.819> they<00:05:33.150> wouldn't<00:05:33.419> hold<00:05:33.629> the<00:05:33.900> dog<00:05:34.110> but<00:05:34.349> they

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
they they wouldn't hold the dog but they

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:54.939 
they they wouldn't hold the dog but they
would<00:05:34.620> allow<00:05:35.009> the<00:05:35.069> dog<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.400> run<00:05:35.849> towards<00:05:36.270> me

you think back to that first initial
thing<00:06:37.400> that<00:06:37.610> we<00:06:37.730> started<00:06:38.120> with<00:06:38.240> that<00:06:44.200> it's

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
thing that we started with that it's

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.710 
thing that we started with that it's
vague<00:06:45.620> it's<00:06:45.980> just<00:06:46.190> fuzzy<00:06:46.580> it's<00:06:47.150> like<00:06:47.420> it's

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
vague it's just fuzzy it's like it's

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720 
vague it's just fuzzy it's like it's
like<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:48.050> white<00:06:48.320> noise<00:06:48.710> on<00:06:48.980> the<00:06:49.100> TV<00:06:49.460> when<00:06:49.610> the

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
it's there but I can't get it to really

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.990 
it's there but I can't get it to really
calm<00:06:54.860> and<00:06:54.890> I'm<00:06:55.130> and<00:06:55.340> trust<00:06:55.580> me<00:06:55.700> I've<00:06:55.850> tried

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
calm and I'm and trust me I've tried

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.260 
calm and I'm and trust me I've tried
I've<00:06:56.960> tried<00:06:56.990> multiple<00:06:57.350> times<00:06:57.650> like<00:06:58.010> to<00:06:58.760> get<00:06:59.150> it

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
I've tried multiple times like to get it

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.500 
I've tried multiple times like to get it
to<00:06:59.450> to<00:07:00.110> manifest<00:07:00.530> and<00:07:01.010> this<00:07:01.190> just<00:07:01.430> really<00:07:01.700> but

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
to to manifest and this just really but

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.790 
to to manifest and this just really but
like<00:07:02.660> I<00:07:02.780> said<00:07:02.840> I<00:07:03.020> do<00:07:03.170> have<00:07:03.620> the

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
like I said I do have the

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.400 
like I said I do have the
black-and-white<00:07:04.100> flicker<00:07:05.080> that'll<00:07:06.080> come<00:07:06.380> in

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
black-and-white flicker that'll come in

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.280 
black-and-white flicker that'll come in
which<00:07:07.160> was<00:07:07.370> the<00:07:07.400> second<00:07:08.000> thing<00:07:08.240> I<00:07:08.600> still<00:07:09.080> get<00:07:09.260> a

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.290 
which was the second thing I still get a

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.230 
which was the second thing I still get a
little<00:07:09.500> bit<00:07:09.740> of<00:07:09.860> that<00:07:09.980> now<00:07:10.280> I'm<00:07:10.640> hoping<00:07:11.090> that

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
little bit of that now I'm hoping that

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.120 
little bit of that now I'm hoping that
eventually<00:07:11.360> that<00:07:11.870> might<00:07:12.080> go<00:07:12.320> so<00:07:12.560> a<00:07:12.590> second

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
eventually that might go so a second

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.400 
eventually that might go so a second
thing<00:07:13.280> the<00:07:14.180> second<00:07:14.570> thing<00:07:14.600> was<00:07:14.960> the<00:07:15.110> scene

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
thing the second thing was the scene

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.490 
thing the second thing was the scene
where<00:07:16.570> where<00:07:17.570> was<00:07:17.720> then<00:07:17.870> black<00:07:18.110> and<00:07:18.140> white

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
where where was then black and white

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.880 
where where was then black and white
ain't<00:07:18.650> no<00:07:18.770> noise<00:07:19.270> but<00:07:20.270> it's<00:07:20.570> not<00:07:20.870> a<00:07:20.900> it's<00:07:21.800> not

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.109 
just think about that but more than
anything<00:07:41.490> else

00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:42.119 
anything else

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:47.839 
anything else
I<00:07:42.149> just<00:07:42.629> feel<00:07:42.929> since<00:07:46.219> that's<00:07:47.219> what<00:07:47.399> more<00:07:47.729> so

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:47.849 
I just feel since that's what more so

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:49.850 
I just feel since that's what more so
that's<00:07:48.119> what<00:07:48.330> I<00:07:48.360> kind<00:07:48.599> of<00:07:48.749> do<00:07:49.229> play<00:07:49.469> more<00:07:49.679> than

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 
that's what I kind of do play more than

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.069 
that's what I kind of do play more than
anything
