00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
string on the third fret so it looks

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.050 
string on the third fret so it looks
like<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:23.900> have<00:01:24.020> there<00:01:24.640> there<00:01:25.640> and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
and then you have an a chord

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.060 
and then you have an a chord
it's<00:01:34.760> going<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.030> go<00:01:35.180> first<00:01:35.480> finger<00:01:36.070> fourth

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
it's going to go first finger fourth

if that doesn't fit you can skip your
first<00:01:51.020> finger<00:01:51.320> again<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.770> use<00:01:52.040> these<00:01:52.370> three

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
first finger again and use these three

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.400 
first finger again and use these three
fingers<00:01:52.820> or<00:01:53.150> if<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.720> wanted<00:01:53.870> an<00:01:54.020> easy<00:01:54.170> way

fingers or if you wanted an easy way

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.710 
fingers or if you wanted an easy way
just<00:01:54.920> put<00:01:55.070> one<00:01:55.250> finger<00:01:55.430> across<00:01:55.730> all<00:01:56.090> three<00:01:56.480> and

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
just put one finger across all three and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.050 
just put one finger across all three and
mute<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.590> E<00:01:57.770> string<00:01:58.250> you're<00:01:58.760> going<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:58.970> play

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
mute the E string you're going to play

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.180 
mute the E string you're going to play
four<00:01:59.450> because<00:01:59.750> they<00:01:59.920> start<00:02:00.920> off<00:02:01.010> in<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.160> a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
four because they start off in the a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.450 
four because they start off in the a
string<00:02:01.550> of<00:02:01.670> course

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.410 

and<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.700> three<00:02:05.850> chords<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.210> need<00:02:06.360> to

look paradise the strumming pattern for
Paradise<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.259> fairly<00:02:10.500> straightforward

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.500 

strung<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> pattern<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.280> Paradise<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.390> a

strung a pattern for Paradise is it's a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.449 
strung a pattern for Paradise is it's a
sort<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.870> six<00:02:25.260> eight<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.830> twelve<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.310> it's

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
sort of a six eight or twelve a so it's

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.699 
sort of a six eight or twelve a so it's

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
gonna be a three feel you're going to go

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:38.930 
gonna be a three feel you're going to go
on

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.100 

like<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.180> except<00:02:40.570> we're<00:02:40.690> also<00:02:40.780> going<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.020> hit

like that except we're also going to hit

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.010 
like that except we're also going to hit
the<00:02:41.200> strings<00:02:41.410> going<00:02:41.560> up

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
the strings going up

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.770 
the strings going up
so<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.560> gonna<00:02:43.680> go

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.170 

they<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.740> get<00:02:49.860> away<00:02:49.950> with<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.580> or<00:02:51.090> if

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
they can get away with just that or if

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.559 
they can get away with just that or if
you'd<00:02:51.300> rather<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.050> can<00:02:52.170> play<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.709> root<00:02:53.250> note
