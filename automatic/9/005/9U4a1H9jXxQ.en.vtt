00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
the summer you had heat humidity so it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
the summer you had heat humidity so it
was<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.890> gamble<00:03:00.370> every<00:03:00.520> year<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.300> were

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
was a gamble every year that you were

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.670 
was a gamble every year that you were
out<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.750> frontier<00:03:02.170> whether<00:03:02.470> you're<00:03:02.560> gonna

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
out on the frontier whether you're gonna

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.100 
out on the frontier whether you're gonna
make<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.280> or<00:03:03.370> not

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110

for<00:03:05.110> AC<00:03:05.200> 3<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.710> biggest<00:03:05.920> difference<00:03:06.370> just

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
for AC 3 the biggest difference just

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.300 
for AC 3 the biggest difference just
having<00:03:06.850> access<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:08.470> frontier<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.130> this

this war at sea was truly a global war

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.979 
this war at sea was truly a global war
and<00:04:17.739> involved<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.550> only<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.940> British<00:04:19.120> but

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
naval engagement of that period was all

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.730 
naval engagement of that period was all
about<00:04:24.490> closing<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.510> distance<00:04:25.750> boarding<00:04:26.650> is

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
about closing the distance boarding is

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.350 
about closing the distance boarding is
the<00:04:26.890> endgame<00:04:27.250> you've<00:04:27.850> got<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.180> able<00:04:28.240> to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
the endgame you've got to be able to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.510 
the endgame you've got to be able to
close<00:04:28.630> with<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.930> enemy<00:04:29.020> get<00:04:29.500> alongside<00:04:29.740> then

didn't even think it was feasible

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.270 
didn't even think it was feasible
because<00:05:19.600> it's<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.840> big<00:05:20.110> moving<00:05:20.380> structure<00:05:20.890> it's

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
game that was a huge challenge that we

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.320 
game that was a huge challenge that we
set<00:05:40.889> ourselves<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:41.430> actually<00:05:41.909> turned<00:05:42.240> out

set ourselves and actually turned out

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:52.970 
set ourselves and actually turned out
pretty<00:05:42.449> good
