00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
baby's feeling well I was worried about

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
baby's feeling well I was worried about
them<00:00:41.520> yesterday<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.329> both<00:00:42.450> had

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
them yesterday because they both had

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
them yesterday because they both had
stuffed<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.290> nose<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.160> what

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
stuffed up nose as they just have what

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.290 
stuffed up nose as they just have what
kitty<00:00:45.000> colds<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.570> guessing<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.430> makes<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
kitty colds I'm guessing but it makes it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.670 
kitty colds I'm guessing but it makes it
hard<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.809> eat<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:49.559> they

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
hard for them to eat because they

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
hard for them to eat because they
breathe<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.100> their<00:00:50.250> nose<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.879> eat<00:00:51.090> with

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
breathe out their nose and they eat with

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
breathe out their nose and they eat with
their<00:00:51.300> mouth<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.949> nose<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> clogged

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
their mouth so if your nose is clogged

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
their mouth so if your nose is clogged
up<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.180> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> hard<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> chew<00:00:55.260> things<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
up it's kind of hard to chew things and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.119 
up it's kind of hard to chew things and
not<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.640> concerned<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.210> breathing<00:00:58.129> so

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
not be concerned with breathing so

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
not be concerned with breathing so
they've<00:00:59.609> clearly<00:01:00.300> learned<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
they've clearly learned that and so I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.420 
they've clearly learned that and so I
don't<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.710> either<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.190> really

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
don't think either one of them really

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
don't think either one of them really
ate<00:01:02.579> anything<00:01:02.879> yesterday<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.589> both

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
