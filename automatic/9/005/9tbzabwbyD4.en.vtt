00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.790
 another of the programs that serve 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.360
 add a menu is the company 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.750
 stardock this company for years has been 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.970
 dedicated to create different designs for 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.160
 windows to change the appearance that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.580
 has and now has created this program 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.400
 which is called start eight or start 8 in 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.230
 Spanish enters google and writes these 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.060
 words that you are seeing so that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.370
 find the page that appears on 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.320
 start I'm going to click on this 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.649
 result and it will take us directly 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.170
 towards the program to install the menu 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.559
 started this program is not free 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.649
 I think it costs $ 5 let's see if 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.649
 It actually costs 5 dollars either 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.199
 it's very expensive but we can install a 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.050
 trial version to see a view 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.550
 prior to this start menu we are 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.460
 looking at some of the options that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.320
 supports the program says it can 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.080
 add a menu with the appearance of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.210
 windows 7 but with the improvements that it has 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.520
 windows 8 also says that you can 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.100
 add shortcuts to 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.790
 applications or programs in the menu 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.400
 start 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.900
 also supports a jump list 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.020
 You also have a search option 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.150
 directly from the menu says that 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.060
 can start windows directly 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.010
 opening the desk is jumping 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 the start screen in a few words 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.470
 it starts like in windows 7 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.630
 the menu since it takes the color of the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.910
 taskbar this means that if 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.310
 we change the color of happiness 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.620
 bar automatically the menu is going to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.240
 take the start button can be changed 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.460
 for an image according to this 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.430
 feature different from the one that brings 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.950
 by default or any other image that 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.130
 we can select the screen of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.110
 home can also be opened from the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.690
 Start menu to be added can 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.509
 deactivate the hot spots between 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.090
 quotes that refers to the menus that 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.670
 appear when we move the cursor of the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.979
 mouse to the corners also says 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 that adds an option to press the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.510
 Windows key and show the screen 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.450
 start and add support for the group 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.920
 of privacy these are the options that 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.810
 includes the program that is called 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.310
 start 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.410
 or start 8 let's go down or I'm going to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.140
 download a trial version doing 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.690
 click on this area is asking us for a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.540
 mailing address where it will be sent 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 the link for the download I'm going to do it and 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.760
 I'm going to press the download button now 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 download the program and it will start the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 installation appears this window I'm going to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.599
 press that accepted the terms of the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.730
 next press leave appears me 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.970
 the folder or path where you are going to install 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.769
 I'm going to press the next button 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.680
 the installation begins and quickly 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.290
 I'm going to press finish and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 we see how this window opens where 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.370
 says welcome to start eight and also 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.160
 three options appear one that says 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.340
 try and down says evaluate the program 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.980
 for 30 days another one that says buy where 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.200
 the price appears 5 dollars or in case of 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.660
 that we already have some license 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.160
 select this option I will click 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.670
 in the first one that is the one of 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.620
 try a message that says 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.940
 wait please and we are seeing 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.909
 that we have two options for 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.860
 select a menu that says with style 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.459
 of windows 7 and another that says with a 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.069
 windows 8 style is something curious this 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.569
 menu because it adds mosaics like those that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.670
 we see on the home screen 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.590
 let's see both I'm going to select the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.470
 first of them that says the style of 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.560
 windows 7 and below a list for 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.140
 select different topics I will leave 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.069
 this one that says the default and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.780
 we are seeing how a more menu appears 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.940
 interesting that the previous one that you 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.519
 I showed and we are also seeing that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.530
 also appears in Spanish 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.780
 all options this menu by 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.599
 Of course it's better than the previous is 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.060
 identical to the menus we've seen in 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.879
 previous versions if we change the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.769
 theme will change something the appearance 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.870
 as we are now seeing the corners 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.329
 they are rounded which is precisely what 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.430
 which says here rounded topic and in the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.960
 description says a mix of windows 7 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.930
 and windows 8 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.150
 we have the other one that says windows 7 and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.569
 we see how I add a dark color and 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.389
 as we select the options 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.919
 and the icons of this area is something that 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.990
 we have seen in windows 7 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.080
 this the interesting thing that we can 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.360
 select the theme that we like 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.999
 we can even change the color in 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.099
 this area down we also have a 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:52.669
 question that says how you would like it 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.589
 you see the start button appears a 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.229
 flag or this one that is what 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:05:00.319
 We are seeing or adding an image 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.929
 customized from this button we can 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.360
 create a custom image using 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:07.550
 these templates that you are seeing these 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.009
 are the ones that install the program we can 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.349
 select any of them but for 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.499
 course based on this design 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.419
 we could create our own I 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.259
 to press cancel let's see what 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.999
 this consists of windows style 8 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:26.180
 we see what it does opens a very menu 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:28.580
 large showing the mosaics is 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.619
 practically what the option shows 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.809
 to look precisely as it opens 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:34.999
 we are seeing each one will know what 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:37.430
 choose style we are seeing that there is more 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:39.230
 options how to configure and there are many 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.120
 configurable options of the 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.790
 I will not talk to not be longer 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.880
 this course but in the case of this area 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:50.450
 we can select what shortcuts 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.880
 show or not the start menu this 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.340
 means not to show and this means 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.490
 show as link what is what is 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.810
 active in some of the options 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.700
 only you change this option if 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.860
 Do you want it to appear or not to appear 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.410
 at the end there is an option that we can 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.480
 configure outside of this program in the 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.480
 control panel that is what do you want that 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.580
 make the off button on this 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.960
 it's like turning off but we can 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.990
 select any of these options 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.720
 that we are seeing when we press the 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.720
 shutdown button on our pc is going to 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.030
 perform this option we have another 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.160
 configuration that says control you 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.780
 I recommend that you experiment with 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.230
 each of these options for you to see 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.200
 what is this program going to do 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.060
 as you saw it expires after 30 days it will 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.070
 stop working so you can 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.650
 buy the full version that is not 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.500
 face are 5 dollars only this is the 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.900
 Best choice in terms of menus 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.720
 they sell it for a reason because it has many 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.520
 advanced options unlike the other 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.800
 menu that we installed that is very simple 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.470
 but in any case you can do what 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.900
 basic that in our case is having the 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:03.880
 shortcuts to options or 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.880
 programs that we use the most
