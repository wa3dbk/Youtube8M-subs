try<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.500> get<00:04:14.710> after<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.160> with<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.460> draw

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
try to get after it with this draw

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.949 
try to get after it with this draw
because<00:04:16.170> someone<00:04:17.170> it<00:04:17.290> out<00:04:17.440> crappy<00:04:18.010> looking

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
because someone it out crappy looking

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.720 
because someone it out crappy looking
like<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.140> did<00:04:20.290> right<00:04:20.440> there<00:04:20.550> hopefully<00:04:21.550> that's

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
like it did right there hopefully that's

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.770 
like it did right there hopefully that's
just<00:04:22.090> pencil<00:04:22.740> nope<00:04:23.740> that's<00:04:24.100> partially<00:04:24.790> pin<00:04:25.390> so

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
just pencil nope that's partially pin so

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.180 
just pencil nope that's partially pin so
that<00:04:25.810> sucks<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:26.680> all<00:04:26.860> right<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.860> almost

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
that sucks but that all right so almost

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.460 
that sucks but that all right so almost
looks<00:04:30.430> 3d<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.060> it's<00:04:31.440> better<00:04:32.440> than<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.740> was<00:04:34.470> just

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
looks 3d so it's better than it was just

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.510 
looks 3d so it's better than it was just
do<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.130> lines<00:04:36.510> carefully<00:04:37.510> if<00:04:37.720> you're<00:04:38.520> pretty

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
do the lines carefully if you're pretty

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.770 
do the lines carefully if you're pretty
accurate<00:04:40.120> with<00:04:40.390> lines<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.620> can<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.070> faster

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
accurate with lines you can do it faster

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.610 
accurate with lines you can do it faster
but<00:04:43.780> if<00:04:43.870> you're<00:04:44.050> not<00:04:44.200> very<00:04:46.110> accurate<00:04:47.110> with<00:04:47.590> it

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
but if you're not very accurate with it

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.710 
but if you're not very accurate with it
you<00:04:47.980> can<00:04:48.010> just<00:04:49.170> flow<00:04:50.170> but<00:04:50.500> then<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.490> can

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
you can just flow but then you can

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.480 
you can just flow but then you can
little<00:04:52.720> piece<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.230> froth<00:04:53.560> underneath<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
little piece of froth underneath the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.120 
little piece of froth underneath the
cherry<00:04:55.020> now<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.080> can<00:04:56.350> do<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.800> cherry

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
cherry now you can do the cherry

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
cherry now you can do the cherry
actually<00:05:00.120> do<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> little<00:05:03.390> lines<00:05:04.650> beside<00:05:05.650> it

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
actually do a little lines beside it

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.810 
actually do a little lines beside it
then<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.450> do<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.950> chocolate<00:05:08.950> chips<00:05:09.460> that

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
then you can do the chocolate chips that

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.340 
then you can do the chocolate chips that
are<00:05:09.880> on<00:05:10.710> top<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:12.100> milkshake

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.530 

this<00:05:16.980> will<00:05:17.250> take<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:17.460> bit<00:05:17.910> longer<00:05:17.970> than<00:05:18.510> the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
this will take a bit longer than the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:27.439 
this will take a bit longer than the
pencil<00:05:19.020> at<00:05:19.200> one<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.700> are<00:05:21.180> going<00:05:21.860> accurate

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.110 

because<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.139> don't<00:05:28.289> want<00:05:28.349> to<00:05:28.559> screw<00:05:28.830> it<00:05:28.860> up

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
because you don't want to screw it up

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.469 
because you don't want to screw it up
because<00:05:30.120> this<00:05:30.449> is<00:05:30.599> your<00:05:30.719> final<00:05:30.990> draft
