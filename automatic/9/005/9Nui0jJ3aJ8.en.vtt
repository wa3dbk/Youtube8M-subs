00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:34.940
 install now you have to dial the 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.580
 option that we will conclude 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.430
 this installation now go to the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.660
 second step is that the installation 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.560
 the star is not 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.610
