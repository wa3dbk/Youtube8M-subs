00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
recognizing it it's such a simple but

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.380

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
brilliant program that anybody can do

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
brilliant program that anybody can do
yes<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.350> involves<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.830> work<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.400> taking

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
yes it involves some work and taking

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.870 
yes it involves some work and taking
some<00:01:08.880> action<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.600> having<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> deadline<00:01:10.880> which

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
some action and having a deadline which

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
some action and having a deadline which
is<00:01:12.060> why<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.270> works<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.159> but<00:01:14.159> basically<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is why it works and but basically you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.039 
is why it works and but basically you
know<00:01:15.030> people<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.450> getting<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
know people are getting on with it

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
if they get their five and they get

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
if they get their five and they get
their<00:01:26.549> five<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.540> five<00:01:28.350> levels<00:01:28.770> deep

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
their five and so on five levels deep

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
their five and so on five levels deep
now<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> questions<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.470> get

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
now one of the questions that I do get

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.490 
now one of the questions that I do get
asked<00:01:31.979> quite<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.659> happens<00:01:34.140> if

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
asked quite a lot is but what happens if

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.399 
asked quite a lot is but what happens if
I<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.070> manage<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.210> five<00:01:36.570> well

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I don't manage to get my five well

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
I don't manage to get my five well
basically<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> don't<00:01:38.759> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.270> your

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
basically if you don't want to get your

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.270 
basically if you don't want to get your
fine<00:01:39.570> within<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> 20<00:01:40.350> days<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.100> will

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
fine within the 20 days then you will

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.069 
fine within the 20 days then you will
drop<00:01:41.430> out<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.820> ashramites<00:01:42.180> program<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
drop out with the ashramites program and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.560 
drop out with the ashramites program and
that<00:01:43.290> obviously

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
that obviously

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.820 
that obviously
it's<00:01:44.810> not<00:01:44.900> ideally<00:01:45.260> what<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.470> want<00:01:45.650> because

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's not ideally what you want because

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.770 
it's not ideally what you want because
that's<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.700> know<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:47.180> a<00:01:47.300> brilliant<00:01:47.479> way<00:01:47.750> to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
that's you know it's a brilliant way to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.920 
that's you know it's a brilliant way to
market<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:48.800> promote<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:50.210> businesses<00:01:50.630> at<00:01:50.810> the
