00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
cut it out roughly on the bandsaw since

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
cut it out roughly on the bandsaw since
I<00:00:32.160> need<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.520> pieces<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> quarter-inch

would<00:00:39.210> also<00:00:39.420> work<00:00:39.980> then<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> cut

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
would also work then it's just to cut
