00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.699
 st 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 panama we are not going to use 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.819
 six or seven chilies of them for those who like 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:15.729
 a clove of garlic three quarts of a kilo of green tomato half a kilo of steak 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.729
 pictures half a kilo of ground beef 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.699
 oil to fry salt and what we do not like here exposed the people's support 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.060
 As a first step we are going to start to toss the black chiles without letting ourselves burn 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.090
 on the other hand we are going to cook the green tomatoes 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.520
 once they have changed color we will remove from the fire and having 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.400
 license and calves we are going to put them to soak in the hot water 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.250
 together with the tomatoes 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 in a pan let's put some oil 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.820
 we add the meat 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 the mister and the ground meat 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.860
 can deny a little salt if they like to cover and let it rise a little 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.710
 on the other hand we are going to put to grind the tomatoes with the black turns 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.090
 so I'm going to get the twins together with the garlic until Tuesday and we're going to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.670
 bother 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.980
 we keep and once we have been with AIDS and our meat 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.420
 we are going to be visible 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.100
 with a strainer they are used 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 Season with a little salt if necessary 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 and with some chicken powder consommÃ© that is not only the beginning 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.930
 but if you like, you can use it too 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.180
 and good is going to leave the fire for about 10 minutes and 15 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.330
 about medium-low heat 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.460
 once it is ready we pay it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.170
 finally they attended that recipe originally led masisa de redes 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.260
 but it is a very slow process to put meat to cook 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.150
 so to make it more practical and simple I did it with steak 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.800
 so this recipe is one of my favorites 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.370
 hope you like 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.770
 and we're going, the next video will be 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.930
