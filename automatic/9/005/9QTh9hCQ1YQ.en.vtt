00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.789
 league six days in my bed and 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.140
 strong the ceiling has the hope in the 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.029
 lost because she can not save herself 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.129
 but abandoned everything 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.440
 run on the cliffs young me page 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.890
 jump before the inner calls for certain 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.449
 completely emaciated pale and empty standing 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.610
 no more because everyone steps yours 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.680
 burden it would be the blade yet 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.360
 I do not go to it you want to know 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.250
 how I feel who is not talking right now 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.470
 because I can not see the rollos 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.940
 below and the light house on the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.949
 nightstand next to me forms 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.699
 Dense dust one with the finger 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:04.670
 face down the mouth angle 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:08.770
 somehow it looks a little dark 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.950
 Seems like the world is motionless 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.790
 paralyzed dark walls become a pawn 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 everything will determine 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.770
 and it seems for the wildly motionless 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.850
 paralyzed dark walls 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.890
 everything seems like shut down 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.750
 somehow I want to be caught at home 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.789
 if I hold times two minutes in a good mood 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.350
 the mood lights and after the rain 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.119
 the sun comes i can go far and 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.520
 it may not be wide to see 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.560
 time for me to go to the thoughts 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.119
 not in hand but you me and that 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.130
 forever trying to explain to him 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.810
 what is with me on understand me 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.149
 somehow everything stays the same 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.369
 no picture develops in the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.369
 care is all quietly immobilized 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.869
 without seems like the world 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.330
 motionless paralyzed dark walls become 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.380
 to the farmers 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.870
 it is wiped and it seems 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.630
 as if the world was motionless paralyzed 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.610
 Dark walls are going to wall everything 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.610
 looks like shut down
