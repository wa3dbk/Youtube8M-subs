 [Music] 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.600
 hi what's up how are you today s &amp; p 26 and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.100
 this time is I want to bring a video 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.880
 tutorial in which I want to teach you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 how to recover files data files 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.210
 of a hard drive that is damaged is worth the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.130
 which we can not access and I love you 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.680
 say that because I'm going to put you in 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.960
 question what has happened to me with a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 hard disk in which I can not access 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.790
 he agreed as we can check 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.590
 we have these two hard drives the 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.660
 operating system and the data those 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.000
 those two hard drives are the ones that are 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 internal in the computer vale do not have 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.409
 nothing to do with the tutorial of agreement 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.490
 we have to look at the local disk 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.940
 efe on the axis and on the t that hp list for 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.580
 those three hard drives that are part 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.380
 of a hard drive if only worth is for 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.500
 massa they are split to two in three 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.270
 is a removable hard drive and in which 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.380
 for whatever it is they have been damaged 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.180
 some files 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 inside the hard drive and we can not 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.710
 access it let's do a test 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.110
 to see if we can access the disk 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.619
 local efe and you will be able to check that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.729
 it does not give me access it does not allow me access 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.759
 to be able to enter that disk and this 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.560
 while he sends me the message to 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.420
 that you see this the way 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.939
 fix it the only way to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.670
 solve it the problem is to format the 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.090
 Hard disk is worth no other solution 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.740
 available for this 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.890
 what happens is that yes we can 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.990
 recover the files that are in that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.100
 hard drive through a program that is 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.179
 call dating dating good to say 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.039
 what is the program called because the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.129
 truth that I do not remember very well but 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.690
 it works perfectly according 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.450
 as we can see we have here what 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.060
 which is the hard drive and it tells me not to 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.160
 I can enter that I do want to format 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.540
 the good thing because I do not want to format it 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.069
 because I want to retrieve the information 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.690
 I have inside 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.769
 logically then we will give you in 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.769
 cancel voucher 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.870
 saying this you have seen that I can not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.670
 enter the hard drive I can not see the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.030
 content what we have to do is 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.800
 Well here I am asked for another message 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.980
 that I can not that there was an error 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.340
 data and I can not enter vale 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.220
 said this as I have commented 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.230
 we have to have this program worth not 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.370
 I'll leave the description of the video worth 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.920
 I will not leave it 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.360
 You can find it by networks as 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 by many places so I'm not going to 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.810
 leave in the description of the video and the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.360
 program itself is called that is here 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.360
 it's worth so good he had said it well 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.060
 the only thing the end dating back is a 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 very good program is I started to 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.200
 use a lot and it serves the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.770
 perfection of agreement is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.580
 saying this, we are not going to open it 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.590
 forgive you have to open it with 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.650
 administrator we give you right button 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.959
 execute as administrator that always 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 before opening it you have to open it with the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.670
 administrator of agreement if not no 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.860
 it will work, this would be what the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.010
 graphical interface of this program let's 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.599
 to manage everything to make it better and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.580
 good as I have told you this is the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.470
 graphic interface in which we 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.680
 we have to mark the popcorn 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.200
 Quickscan person is worth the scan 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299
 quick ok we want you to do the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.580
 hard disk scanning be as fast 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.150
 possible once this is done we give it in 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.790
 nets and starts scanning what they are 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.130
 the hard drives that are in my 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.690
 team now connected not only 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.599
 those who have internal what are 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.239
 internal but also external this 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.540
 I already tell you it may take a little time 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.069
 it may take a couple of minutes so 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.379
 watch or pause the video and when 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.890
 finished I return it to resume 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.890
 until now 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.930
 It is worth once you have finished the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.400
 scanning will simply close us that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.070
 window that you could see now 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.870
 same where he was scanning and so 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.570
 will appear what is this next 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.240
 window this interface in which 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.760
 we have to know what disc 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.260
 hard is the is that the external not the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.110
 that the one that gives us problems 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.740
 I in my case know what it is because it is what 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.900
 located by the size of the hard disk is 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580
 of four hundred and sixty-six 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.550
 gigabytes and is the one that is me 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.350
 giving errors once this is done 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.300
 we open and here we have what are the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.430
 partitions 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.250
 we open again and we see that we have 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.409
 another good partition in this case I'm going 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.720
 to make only one partition due to 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.759
 How good are many because I'm not going to 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.210
 be recovering the files of so many 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:11.580
 would take a lot and well this is the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.680
 smaller and the fastest one is going to 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.349
 recover well let's be able to see the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.289
 files that contain so 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.800
 we select then our hard drive and 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.620
 we give in next is worth now would be another 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.990
 once scanning what is the 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.479
 the disc is worth to recover what 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.630
 which are the files we tell him and from time to time 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.940
 when will this error appear this 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.850
 admiration says no we have found 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.780
 an error and if we want to continue to 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.780
 we say yes 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.250
 to all this the vale that means stiff 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.250
 we are all in management 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.970
 and start again to check this 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.770
 process can also take a while 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:58.190
 In this case, as you can see, I miss it 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.620
 fast poquillo and we have here what is 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.380
 another window in which we have 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.620
 what to give in neds we tell you again that 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:11.210
 is already with wall sorry I think English 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.460
 little and we would have it now extracted 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.480
 half of the progress now I follow another 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.770
 time 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.919
 until they finish 100 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.540
 we wait a few moments and we have 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.510
 here the archives 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.120
 of which contained our disk 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.000
 hard to which we could not enter tell you 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.500
 that this depending on the files that 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.690
 you have the data that you have there 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.490
 inside that hard drive 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.370
 It will take more or less if you have a 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.470
 hard disk because 500 gigabytes of data 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.940
 obviously it's going to take a lot longer 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.770
 in recovering files 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.270
 now you wonder how we can 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.160
 retrieve them as I can get them out of there 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.370
 so very simple we simply take 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.170
 we double-click on the folder 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.360
 We copy and copy it where 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.670
 we want, we can copy 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.770
 where we want in data 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.730
 where I want to go to take where 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.980
 I want which is pretty good 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.350
 saying this I think I've solved 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.470
 some doubts well I hope to have 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.570
 solved at least to me has 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.830
 this program has been served quite well and I hope 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.710
 that to all of you who are watching this 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.570
 video serve you also with this I 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.610
 I said goodbye, I hope that I have 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.860
 liked and if so, give like favorites 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.520
 and subscribe to the channel a greeting to all 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.520
 and chao 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.740
 Well here you can select between 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.530
 previous video the highlight and the video to 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.629
 the theory can also give like altery 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.069
 javier iscar is now bulky and 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.560
 subscribe to the channel 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:48.189
