she's<00:01:36.229> Dombey<00:01:36.920> basically<00:01:37.460> she's<00:01:37.700> turning

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
she's Dombey basically she's turning

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.300 
she's Dombey basically she's turning
she's<00:01:38.329> kind<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.630> halfway<00:01:38.810> between<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:40.189> know

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
she can still do a lot of these

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.459 
she can still do a lot of these
