and guess what else is close to the
ground<00:00:52.460> base<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
ground base so do you think some of you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
ground base so do you think some of you
might<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.379> bit<00:00:55.469> scared<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.340> don't

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and live we can't really be on our put

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
and live we can't really be on our put
our<00:01:36.750> weight<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.110> our<00:01:37.259> back<00:01:37.470> foot<00:01:37.710> because

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
our weight on our back foot because

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.929 
our weight on our back foot because
guess<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:38.430> happens<00:01:39.740> exactly<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
guess what happens exactly right so if I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
guess what happens exactly right so if I
try<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.210> move<00:01:42.450> oh<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.439> fall<00:01:43.649> over

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
try to move oh I'm gonna fall over

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.830 
try to move oh I'm gonna fall over
aren't<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.579> more<00:01:44.759> importantly<00:01:44.880> who<00:01:45.659> else

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
aren't I or more importantly who else

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
aren't I or more importantly who else
comes<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.159> need<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.549> our<00:01:47.729> way

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
comes out so we need to have our way

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.330 
comes out so we need to have our way
pretty<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.600> our<00:01:48.750> front<00:01:49.079> foot<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.950> we

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pretty much on our front foot so that we

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.670 
pretty much on our front foot so that we
can<00:01:50.549> step<00:01:50.790> left<00:01:51.119> towards<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> ball<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.500> can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
can step left towards the ball or we can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
can step left towards the ball or we can
move<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> ball<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.360> need<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.659> be

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
move right to the ball so we need to be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
move right to the ball so we need to be
pretty<00:01:55.049> mobile<00:01:55.850> we<00:01:56.850> don't<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
pretty mobile we don't want to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.600 
pretty mobile we don't want to
necessarily<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.899> our<00:01:58.049> feet<00:01:58.369> like<00:01:59.369> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
necessarily have our feet like this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
necessarily have our feet like this
either<00:01:59.969> same<00:02:00.540> thing<00:02:00.810> isn't<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.380> not

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
either same thing isn't it we're not

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
either same thing isn't it we're not
very<00:02:01.649> balanced<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.579> very<00:02:02.969> hard<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> change

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
very balanced are we very hard to change

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
very balanced are we very hard to change
direction<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.229> our<00:02:04.380> feet<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.770> really

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
direction when our feet are really

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
direction when our feet are really
square<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.299> foot<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.780> front<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> other

square so one foot in front of the other

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229 
square so one foot in front of the other
it's<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.039> personal<00:02:08.580> preference<00:02:09.000> right

it's up to you personal preference right

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.840 
it's up to you personal preference right
or<00:02:09.390> left<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:11.039> this

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
or left I have this

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.240 
or left I have this
rural<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.960> anything<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.410> goes<00:02:13.560> down<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
rural that anything that goes down the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.220 
rural that anything that goes down the
right<00:02:14.490> side<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:15.210> body<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.200> not

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
right side of your body so it's not

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.660 
right side of your body so it's not
accurate<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.040> can't<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.610> thing

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
accurate and you can't get this thing

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.090 
accurate and you can't get this thing
across<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.330> right<00:02:18.510> side<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.680> up<00:02:19.890> right

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
across to the right side you go up right

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.130 
across to the right side you go up right
and<00:02:20.640> trap<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.570> four<00:02:21.780> stick<00:02:22.050> because

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and trap it with your four stick because

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.980 
and trap it with your four stick because
that's<00:02:22.440> easier<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.580> easier<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.510> goes<00:02:24.720> to

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
that's easier it's easier if it goes to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.780 
that's easier it's easier if it goes to
the<00:02:25.110> left<00:02:25.350> side<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.770> his<00:02:25.890> stick<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.520> step

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the left side of his stick to step

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.460 
the left side of his stick to step
across<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> trap<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.290> that's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
across and get the trap on so that's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.290 
across and get the trap on so that's
slightly<00:02:28.740> easier<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:29.970> you're<00:02:30.120> teaching

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
slightly easier so if you're teaching

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.390 
slightly easier so if you're teaching
your<00:02:30.750> drag<00:02:31.230> route<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.770> your<00:02:31.980> people<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400

dragging the ball out you want them to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.330 
dragging the ball out you want them to
try<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> go<00:02:35.460> more<00:02:35.790> towards<00:02:36.230> your<00:02:37.230> left<00:02:38.040> side

than your right side how did you get
your<00:02:40.710> stick<00:02:40.920> across<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:42.030> how<00:02:42.270> do<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.450> try<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> get

your stick across so how do I try to get
that<00:02:44.190> catch<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.090> need<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> ball

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
that catch that we need so that the ball

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.860 
that catch that we need so that the ball
comes<00:02:47.160> into<00:02:47.610> my<00:02:47.730> stick<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.240> catch<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.780> I

comes into my stick and I catch it I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.570 
comes into my stick and I catch it I
control<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.220> person<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:51.030> hit<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:52.580> soft

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
it down a little bit closer you'll have

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.020 
it down a little bit closer you'll have
better<00:04:03.989> control<00:04:04.549> remember<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.700> want<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:05.909> be

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
better control remember you want to be

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.839 
better control remember you want to be
able<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.299> control<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.500> amount<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:08.129> rebound

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
able to control the amount of rebound

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.720 
able to control the amount of rebound
the<00:04:09.629> butt<00:04:10.049> as<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.709> ball<00:04:10.920> comes<00:04:11.370> off<00:04:11.519> your

the butt as the ball comes off your

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.670 
the butt as the ball comes off your
stick<00:04:11.939> you<00:04:12.420> don't<00:04:12.450> want<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.989> go<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.500> or

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
stick you don't want it to go right or

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.869 
stick you don't want it to go right or
left<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.129> actually<00:04:14.400> want<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.579> be<00:04:14.670> able<00:04:14.790> to

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
left you actually want to be able to

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.110 
left you actually want to be able to
control<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.450> rebound<00:04:15.959> okay<00:04:16.949> so<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.910> is

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
control that rebound okay so this is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.479 
control that rebound okay so this is
just<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.479> very<00:04:18.510> first<00:04:19.109> sort<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.829> start<00:04:20.160> of

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
just the very first sort of start of

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.610 
just the very first sort of start of
learning<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.090> new<00:04:21.299> technique<00:04:21.780> we're<00:04:22.380> only

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
learning that new technique we're only

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.409 
learning that new technique we're only
over<00:04:22.830> about<00:04:23.039> five<00:04:23.340> meters<00:04:23.789> there<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.270> we<00:04:24.360> want

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
over about five meters there so we want

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.510 
over about five meters there so we want
to<00:04:24.539> gradually<00:04:25.050> increase<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.590> distance<00:04:26.010> so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
to gradually increase the distance so

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.700 
to gradually increase the distance so
that<00:04:26.699> you<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.240> used<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.110> ball<00:04:28.289> coming<00:04:28.530> at

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
that you get used to the ball coming at

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.070 
that you get used to the ball coming at
you<00:04:28.919> harder<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.610> faster<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:30.479> little<00:04:30.930> bit

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
you harder and faster a little bit

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.350 
you harder and faster a little bit
quicker<00:04:31.380> as<00:04:31.680> well<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.430> then<00:04:32.520> finally<00:04:33.090> go<00:04:33.330> to

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
quicker as well and then finally go to

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.390 
quicker as well and then finally go to
about<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.110> top<00:04:34.289> of<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.500> circle<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.370> that

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
about to the top of the circle so that

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.250 
about to the top of the circle so that
you<00:04:35.639> in<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.510> know<00:04:36.600> you're<00:04:36.810> putting<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.139> in

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
you in you know you're putting it in

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.379 
you in you know you're putting it in
game<00:04:37.530> speed<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.400> you're<00:04:38.699> actually<00:04:39.030> at<00:04:39.150> game

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
game speed and you're actually at game

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.750 
game speed and you're actually at game
speed<00:04:39.419> as<00:04:39.990> well<00:04:40.199> as<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.680> get<00:04:40.889> stronger<00:04:41.310> and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
speed as well as you get stronger and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.189 
speed as well as you get stronger and
you<00:04:41.910> might<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.180> able<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.419> do<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.690> one<00:04:42.870> two<00:04:43.080> as

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
you might be able to do that one two as

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.600 
you might be able to do that one two as
well<00:04:43.380> it's<00:04:43.590> again<00:04:43.979> it's<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.250> personal

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
well it's again it's a personal

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.250 
well it's again it's a personal
preference<00:04:44.850> with<00:04:45.240> this<00:04:45.419> one<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.810> other<00:04:45.990> thing

preference with this one the other thing

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.320 
preference with this one the other thing
is<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.039> mistake<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.580> lot<00:04:47.789> of<00:04:47.880> Trumpets<00:04:48.210> will

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
is is a mistake a lot of Trumpets will

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.550 
is is a mistake a lot of Trumpets will
make<00:04:48.510> is<00:04:48.630> they<00:04:48.750> won't<00:04:48.900> have<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.289> stick

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560
