and<00:01:45.000> cheaper<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.290> make<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.560> cheaper

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and cheaper than this to make it cheaper

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.319 
and cheaper than this to make it cheaper
and<00:01:47.070> faster<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.640> make<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> part<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> health

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and faster and make it part of health

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.840 
and faster and make it part of health
care<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:49.229> took<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> technology<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> enabled

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
care we took the technology that enabled

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.170 
care we took the technology that enabled
your<00:01:51.030> phone<00:01:51.720> or<00:01:52.259> your<00:01:52.320> computer

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
your phone or your computer

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
your phone or your computer
semiconductors<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.960> made<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> first

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
semiconductors and we made for the first

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.760 
semiconductors and we made for the first
time<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.369> chip<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.450> instead<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.229> seeing<00:01:58.439> light

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
time a chip that instead of seeing light

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
time a chip that instead of seeing light
like<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.460> take<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> picture<00:01:59.939> sees<00:02:00.719> chemistry

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
like you take a picture sees chemistry

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.209 
like you take a picture sees chemistry
so<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.240> your<00:02:03.540> DNA<00:02:04.219> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
so now we can go right from your DNA to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.429 
so now we can go right from your DNA to
digital<00:02:05.640> information<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.659> first<00:02:06.990> genome

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
digital information that first genome

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800 
digital information that first genome
actually<00:02:07.680> took<00:02:08.220> ten<00:02:08.849> years<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.300> cost<00:02:09.450> three

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
actually took ten years and cost three

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
actually took ten years and cost three
billion<00:02:10.080> now<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.400> into<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> major

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
billion now you can go into a major

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.400 
billion now you can go into a major
medical<00:02:12.209> center

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
medical center

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.130 
medical center
your<00:02:13.590> genome<00:02:13.890> sequenced<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.240> day<00:02:15.630> get

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
your genome sequenced and that day get

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.320 
your genome sequenced and that day get
information<00:02:16.770> back<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.250> how<00:02:17.700> your<00:02:17.910> disease<00:02:18.150> is

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
information back on how your disease is

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
information back on how your disease is
progressing<00:02:19.020> or<00:02:19.170> how<00:02:19.350> you'll<00:02:19.530> respond<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.950> a

in a way see into the future can we not

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.540 
in a way see into the future can we not
is<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.200> overstating<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.370> find

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
is that overstating what we can find

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.640 
is that overstating what we can find
from<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:26.910> machine<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:27.990> now<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
from this machine right now we can see a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.650 
from this machine right now we can see a
little<00:02:29.010> bit<00:02:29.220> into<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.580> future<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.210> as<00:02:30.330> more

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
little bit into the future but as more

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.150 
little bit into the future but as more
and<00:02:30.720> more<00:02:30.870> scientists<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:31.920> machine

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
and more scientists use this machine

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.640 
and more scientists use this machine
they'll<00:02:32.970> gather<00:02:33.180> information<00:02:33.660> between<00:02:34.110> your

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
they'll gather information between your

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.000 
they'll gather information between your

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
over the next few years it becomes more

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.020 
over the next few years it becomes more
and<00:02:40.020> more<00:02:40.080> powerful<00:02:40.530> every<00:02:40.890> time<00:02:41.610> somebody

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and more powerful every time somebody

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
and more powerful every time somebody
sequences<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:43.110> beyond<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> individual<00:02:44.010> this

and<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.930> feed<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.320> world<00:03:10.530> because

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and you can feed the world because

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.070 
and you can feed the world because
everything<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.580> based<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.940> DNA<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.840> this

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
thing about investing in technology is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
thing about investing in technology is
it<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.560> only<00:03:22.740> thing<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.520> can<00:03:23.640> change<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
it is the only thing that can change the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.030 
it is the only thing that can change the
cost<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.510> health<00:03:24.690> care<00:03:24.750> when<00:03:25.350> my<00:03:25.500> son<00:03:25.830> was<00:03:25.860> born

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
cost of health care when my son was born

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830 
cost of health care when my son was born
he<00:03:26.550> was<00:03:26.700> rushed<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.240> newborn<00:03:27.450> intensive

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
he was rushed to the newborn intensive

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170 
he was rushed to the newborn intensive
care<00:03:28.230> not<00:03:28.740> breathing<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:29.940> why<00:03:30.150> I

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
care not breathing that's why I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.880 
care not breathing that's why I
developed<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.840> technology<00:03:31.200> because<00:03:31.770> I

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
developed this technology because I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.340 
developed this technology because I
wanted<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.370> know<00:03:32.550> what<00:03:33.150> was<00:03:33.180> going<00:03:33.570> on<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:33.750> my

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
wanted to know what was going on with my

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.670 
wanted to know what was going on with my
son<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.920> wanted<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.490> his<00:03:36.270> genome<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.990> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
son I wanted to know his genome and you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.230 
son I wanted to know his genome and you
just<00:03:37.890> open<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.220> up<00:03:38.370> by<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.580> way<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.060> show

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
just open it up by the way just to show

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.300 
just open it up by the way just to show
us<00:03:39.360> exactly<00:03:39.540> her<00:03:39.900> work<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.500> now<00:03:40.980> when

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
us exactly her work and so now when
