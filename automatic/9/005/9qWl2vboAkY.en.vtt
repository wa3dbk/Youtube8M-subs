little different so it's going to be a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.130 
little different so it's going to be a
little<00:02:32.370> original<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.360> also<00:02:33.510> sort<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.960> what

and<00:03:01.650> lay<00:03:01.950> down<00:03:01.980> some<00:03:02.310> different<00:03:02.580> patterns

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and lay down some different patterns

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.720 
and lay down some different patterns
okay<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.830> reported<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.190> blue<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.640> we

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
okay so as we reported to blue and we

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.850 
okay so as we reported to blue and we
noticed<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> front<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.440> blue<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
noticed that on the front the blue is a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.380 
noticed that on the front the blue is a
little<00:03:08.130> bit<00:03:08.220> heavier<00:03:08.580> than<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.880> needed<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.240> be

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
little bit heavier than we needed to be

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
little bit heavier than we needed to be
so<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.710> we're<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.220> fix<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.490> is

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
so what we're going to do to fix that is

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.490 
so what we're going to do to fix that is
we're<00:03:11.940> going<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> take<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.350> just

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
we're going to take this is this is just

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.420 
we're going to take this is this is just
flat<00:03:13.800> black<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.570> flat<00:03:15.990> black<00:03:16.230> krylon<00:03:16.830> but

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
flat black this is flat black krylon but

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.610 
flat black this is flat black krylon but
it's<00:03:17.700> got<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.090> unique<00:03:18.540> tip<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.320> what<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it's got this unique tip and what the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.770 
it's got this unique tip and what the
tip<00:03:19.920> does<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.670> actually<00:03:20.700> applies<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.540> pan

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
tip does is it actually applies the pan

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.290 
tip does is it actually applies the pan
in<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.290> fan<00:03:22.680> light<00:03:22.980> pattern<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.910> that's<00:03:24.150> going

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
in a fan light pattern so that's going

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.570 
in a fan light pattern so that's going
to<00:03:24.360> allow<00:03:24.420> us<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.110> go<00:03:25.620> around<00:03:25.740> here<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
to allow us to do is go around here and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.840 
to allow us to do is go around here and
just<00:03:27.570> put<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.260> light<00:03:28.590> fan<00:03:29.100> coating<00:03:29.670> a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
just put a really light fan coating a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.820 
just put a really light fan coating a
little<00:03:30.480> bit<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.690> black<00:03:30.900> over<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.260> litter<00:03:31.620> just

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
little bit of black over the litter just

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.740 
little bit of black over the litter just
sort<00:03:32.010> even<00:03:32.310> out<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.550> color<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> light<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
sort even out the color see a light that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.310 
sort even out the color see a light that
is<00:03:34.050> much<00:03:34.560> less<00:03:35.370> intense<00:03:35.880> than<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.150> regular<00:03:36.480> a

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
is much less intense than a regular a

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.000 
is much less intense than a regular a
regular<00:03:38.390> paint<00:03:39.390> tip<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.590> that's<00:03:40.740> that's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
regular paint tip and so that's that's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.920 
regular paint tip and so that's that's
it<00:03:41.220> we're<00:03:41.490> done<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.850> now<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.360> pretty<00:03:42.900> much

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
it we're done and now you pretty much

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.830 
it we're done and now you pretty much
you've<00:03:43.710> taken<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.910> blue<00:03:45.090> intensity<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
you've taken the blue intensity down a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.600 
you've taken the blue intensity down a
little<00:03:46.050> bit<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.830> probably<00:03:47.220> almost<00:03:47.340> looks

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
little bit it probably almost looks

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.280 
little bit it probably almost looks
black<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.240> handle<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.630> trust<00:03:48.810> me<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.020> close

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
black on the handle to trust me up close

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.530 
black on the handle to trust me up close
is<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> really<00:03:50.070> deep<00:03:50.400> really<00:03:51.000> dark<00:03:51.240> midnight

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
blue and that's exactly what we're

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.820

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
looking for alright so the midnight blue

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.380 
looking for alright so the midnight blue
is<00:03:56.070> just<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> base<00:03:56.610> coat<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.180> now<00:03:57.270> we're

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
is just the base coat and now we're

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.460 
is just the base coat and now we're
going<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.540> put<00:03:57.600> down<00:03:57.810> some<00:03:57.960> of<00:03:57.990> these<00:03:58.080> stencils

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
going to put down some of these stencils

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.020 
going to put down some of these stencils
these<00:03:58.710> are<00:03:58.830> just<00:03:58.980> two<00:03:59.220> pieces<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.640> printer

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
these are just two pieces of printer

together<00:04:02.460> I<00:04:03.020> just<00:04:04.020> drew<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.470> some<00:04:04.710> designs

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
together I just drew on some designs

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.350 
together I just drew on some designs
with<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> straight<00:04:05.610> edge<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.820> want<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.270> be

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
with a straight edge and want this to be

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120 
with a straight edge and want this to be
a<00:04:06.390> very<00:04:06.510> geometric<00:04:07.110> camouflage<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.680> need<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.010> do

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
a very geometric camouflage I need to do

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.860 
a very geometric camouflage I need to do
is<00:04:08.310> take<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.490> couple<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:09.270> know<00:04:09.300> round<00:04:09.630> pieces

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
is take a couple you know round pieces

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.680 
is take a couple you know round pieces
of<00:04:10.140> tape<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.610> just<00:04:11.610> put<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:11.970> on<00:04:12.150> wherever

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
of tape and just put them on wherever

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.020 
of tape and just put them on wherever
you

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.390 
you
want<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.390> see<00:04:13.720> blue<00:04:14.260> on<00:04:14.410> your<00:04:14.530> gun<00:04:14.709> so<00:04:15.280> we're

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
want to see blue on your gun so we're

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.379 
want to see blue on your gun so we're
just<00:04:15.430> gonna<00:04:15.580> keep<00:04:15.790> doing<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.150> we'll<00:04:16.299> be

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
just gonna keep doing that we'll be

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.590 
just gonna keep doing that we'll be
right<00:04:16.570> back<00:04:17.670> alright<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.329> we've<00:04:19.450> got<00:04:19.570> our

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
right back alright so now we've got our

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.090 
right back alright so now we've got our
stencils<00:04:20.049> down<00:04:20.230> we<00:04:20.530> just<00:04:20.680> sort<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.829> laid<00:04:20.980> them

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
stencils down we just sort of laid them

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.010 
stencils down we just sort of laid them
in<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> random<00:04:21.549> pattern<00:04:21.579> so<00:04:22.389> basically<00:04:22.840> at<00:04:22.930> this

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
in a random pattern so basically at this

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.379 
in a random pattern so basically at this
point<00:04:23.260> everything<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.830> see<00:04:24.160> that's<00:04:24.970> white

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
point everything you see that's white

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.120 
point everything you see that's white
now<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.840> going<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:25.990> remain<00:04:26.139> dark<00:04:26.710> blue<00:04:26.950> on<00:04:27.070> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
now is going to remain dark blue on the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.470 
now is going to remain dark blue on the
gun<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.520> obviously<00:04:27.850> we<00:04:27.970> don't<00:04:28.060> really<00:04:28.240> want

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
gun so obviously we don't really want

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.120 
gun so obviously we don't really want
that<00:04:28.540> much<00:04:28.810> blue<00:04:29.110> because<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.560> sort<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.770> stands

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
that much blue because it sort of stands

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.500 
that much blue because it sort of stands
out<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.280> little<00:04:30.400> bit<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.060> want<00:04:31.240> sort<00:04:31.389> of<00:04:31.450> a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
out a little bit so we want sort of a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.690 
out a little bit so we want sort of a
dark<00:04:31.780> brown<00:04:31.990> khaki<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:33.130> first<00:04:33.400> we're<00:04:33.550> going<00:04:33.639> to

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
dark brown khaki so first we're going to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.879 
dark brown khaki so first we're going to
put<00:04:33.790> down<00:04:34.000> brown<00:04:34.960> enamel<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.560> we're<00:04:35.740> going<00:04:35.860> to

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
put down brown enamel and we're going to

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.710 
put down brown enamel and we're going to
dust<00:04:36.100> some<00:04:36.340> set<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.820> this<00:04:37.150> is<00:04:37.300> actually<00:04:37.419> this

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
dust some set and this is actually this

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.690 
dust some set and this is actually this
looks<00:04:37.960> like<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.139> perfect<00:04:38.560> color<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.190> khaki<00:04:39.550> but

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
looks like a perfect color the khaki but

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.220 
looks like a perfect color the khaki but
it's<00:04:39.790> actually<00:04:40.000> much<00:04:40.090> once<00:04:40.810> again<00:04:40.930> it's

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
it's actually much once again it's

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.510 
it's actually much once again it's
different<00:04:41.530> from<00:04:41.590> what<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.830> cap<00:04:42.010> says<00:04:42.280> it's

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
different from what the cap says it's

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.070 
different from what the cap says it's
very<00:04:42.580> light<00:04:43.090> it's<00:04:43.270> almost<00:04:43.480> white<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:43.990> like

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
very light it's almost white it's like

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.620 
very light it's almost white it's like
an<00:04:44.200> ivory<00:04:44.620> eggshell<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:45.790> one<00:04:46.300> thing<00:04:46.390> enjoy

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
an ivory eggshell so one thing enjoy

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.240 
an ivory eggshell so one thing enjoy
important<00:04:47.110> when<00:04:47.230> you're<00:04:47.320> painting<00:04:47.560> stencils

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
important when you're painting stencils

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.890 
important when you're painting stencils
is<00:04:48.400> when<00:04:48.760> you're<00:04:48.880> doing<00:04:49.060> like<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.300> primer<00:04:49.600> you

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
is when you're doing like a primer you

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.240 
is when you're doing like a primer you
want<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.169> from<00:04:50.320> every<00:04:50.680> angle<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.950> getting<00:04:51.190> all

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
want it from every angle and getting all

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.710 
want it from every angle and getting all
the<00:04:51.340> nooks<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.640> crannies<00:04:51.970> with<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.210> stencil

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
the nooks and crannies with a stencil

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.780 
the nooks and crannies with a stencil
you<00:04:53.140> want<00:04:53.290> to<00:04:53.350> choose<00:04:53.620> an<00:04:53.860> angle<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.370> go<00:04:54.610> with

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
you want to choose an angle and go with

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.220 
you want to choose an angle and go with
it<00:04:54.940> generally<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.300> want<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.510> go<00:04:55.570> top<00:04:55.840> straight

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
it generally you want to go top straight

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.659 
it generally you want to go top straight
down<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.980> that's<00:04:57.190> going<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.400> do<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.640> it's

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
down and that's going to do is it's

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.090 
down and that's going to do is it's
going<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:57.970> hit<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.770> sconces<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.830> one

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
going to hit the sconces in one

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.590 
going to hit the sconces in one
direction<00:05:00.250> give<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:00.730> really<00:05:00.940> sharp<00:05:01.210> line<00:05:01.419> so

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
direction give you really sharp line so

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.080 
direction give you really sharp line so
you<00:05:01.660> think<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.990> an<00:05:02.560> object<00:05:03.130> if<00:05:03.310> just<00:05:03.610> one<00:05:03.880> light

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
you think of an object if just one light

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.490 
you think of an object if just one light
is<00:05:04.240> shining<00:05:04.510> on<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:04.900> get<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.050> really<00:05:05.229> sharp

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
is shining on it you get a really sharp

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.050 
is shining on it you get a really sharp
shadow<00:05:05.860> but<00:05:06.130> if<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.280> get<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> couple<00:05:06.790> different

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
shadow but if you get a couple different

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.969 
shadow but if you get a couple different
lights<00:05:07.240> from<00:05:07.450> different<00:05:07.720> angles<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.710> shadow

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
lights from different angles the shadow

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.500 
lights from different angles the shadow
is<00:05:09.130> going<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.490> be<00:05:09.550> really<00:05:09.669> blurred<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.360> sort

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
is going to be really blurred and sort

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.580 
is going to be really blurred and sort
of<00:05:10.600> spread<00:05:10.870> out<00:05:10.900> because<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.320> different

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
of spread out because the different

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.969 
of spread out because the different
angles<00:05:11.860> so<00:05:13.050> with<00:05:14.050> our<00:05:14.080> stencil<00:05:14.650> we're<00:05:14.860> going

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
angles so with our stencil we're going

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.820 
angles so with our stencil we're going
to<00:05:15.040> want<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.370> very<00:05:15.550> top<00:05:16.419> down<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.800> that

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
to want to be very top down so that

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.190 
to want to be very top down so that
there<00:05:21.220> that's<00:05:21.820> sort<00:05:22.090> of<00:05:22.120> just<00:05:22.720> going<00:05:22.840> straight

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
there that's sort of just going straight

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.680 
there that's sort of just going straight
down<00:05:23.350> onto<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:23.979> gun<00:05:24.390> that's<00:05:25.390> what<00:05:25.570> we're

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
down onto the gun that's what we're

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.450 
down onto the gun that's what we're
looking<00:05:25.900> for<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.350> now<00:05:26.979> we're<00:05:27.130> going<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.280> paint

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
looking for and now we're going to paint

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.570 
looking for and now we're going to paint
this<00:05:27.580> up<00:05:27.760> we'll<00:05:27.910> be<00:05:27.940> right<00:05:28.120> back<00:05:28.830> ok<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.160> we<00:05:30.460> did

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
this up we'll be right back ok so we did

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.580 
this up we'll be right back ok so we did
the<00:05:30.610> brown<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.960> was<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.080> very<00:05:32.169> dark

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
the brown and that was a very dark

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.350 
the brown and that was a very dark
chocolate<00:05:33.100> brown<00:05:33.280> color<00:05:33.520> as<00:05:33.640> your<00:05:33.760> soft<00:05:34.030> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
chocolate brown color as your soft and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.270 
chocolate brown color as your soft and
then<00:05:34.810> we<00:05:34.900> came<00:05:35.050> in<00:05:35.200> with<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.350> senton<00:05:35.860> as<00:05:36.039> you<00:05:36.130> can

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
then we came in with a senton as you can

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.920 
then we came in with a senton as you can
see<00:05:36.430> this<00:05:36.580> is<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.760> very<00:05:36.940> light<00:05:37.330> dusting<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.840> the

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
see this is a very light dusting of the

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.260 
see this is a very light dusting of the
satin<00:05:38.289> color<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.710> already<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:39.190> can<00:05:39.220> see<00:05:39.400> that

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
satin color and already you can see that

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.890 
satin color and already you can see that
it's<00:05:40.450> really<00:05:41.280> really<00:05:42.280> like<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.210> fortunately

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
it's really really like so fortunately

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.960 
it's really really like so fortunately
this<00:05:44.740> doesn't<00:05:45.220> blend<00:05:45.400> very<00:05:45.490> well<00:05:45.610> with<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.820> blue

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
this doesn't blend very well with a blue

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.370 
this doesn't blend very well with a blue
immediately<00:05:46.510> we're<00:05:46.870> going<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.050> put<00:05:47.140> in<00:05:47.229> a<00:05:47.289> lot

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
immediately we're going to put in a lot

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.930 
immediately we're going to put in a lot
of<00:05:47.440> green<00:05:47.830> after<00:05:48.280> this<00:05:48.400> which<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.729> going<00:05:48.850> to

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
of green after this which is going to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.640 
of green after this which is going to
all<00:05:49.060> bring<00:05:49.479> it<00:05:49.570> together<00:05:49.750> hopefully<00:05:50.169> so

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
all bring it together hopefully so

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.080 
all bring it together hopefully so
that's<00:05:51.310> pretty<00:05:51.460> much<00:05:51.580> what<00:05:51.760> you<00:05:51.820> want<00:05:51.970> to<00:05:52.030> do

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
that's pretty much what you want to do

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.219 
that's pretty much what you want to do
with<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.240> SAP<00:05:52.450> you<00:05:52.600> can<00:05:52.750> see<00:05:52.870> these<00:05:52.960> brown

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
with the SAP you can see these brown

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.750 
with the SAP you can see these brown
spots<00:05:53.560> where<00:05:53.740> I<00:05:53.770> put<00:05:53.890> my<00:05:53.950> finger<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.400> push<00:05:54.610> the

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
spots where I put my finger to push the

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.190 
spots where I put my finger to push the
stencil<00:05:55.180> down<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.360> little<00:05:55.539> bit<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.870> get<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:56.020> more

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
stencil down a little bit to get a more

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.190 
stencil down a little bit to get a more
even<00:05:56.380> sharp<00:05:56.950> wine<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.930> next<00:05:58.930> we're<00:05:59.050> going<00:05:59.140> to

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
even sharp wine and next we're going to

different effects that's the smaller
ones<00:06:42.440> here<00:06:42.800> let's<00:06:43.130> try<00:06:43.400> these<00:06:43.460> out<00:06:43.880> and<00:06:48.580> you

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
ones here let's try these out and you

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.770 
ones here let's try these out and you
can<00:06:49.820> pretty<00:06:49.940> much<00:06:50.030> do<00:06:50.240> whatever<00:06:50.390> you<00:06:50.540> want

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780

can pretty much do whatever you want
with<00:06:50.870> this<00:06:51.050> they're<00:06:51.650> really<00:06:51.770> open-ended<00:06:52.420> i

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
with this they're really open-ended i

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.650 
with this they're really open-ended i
did<00:06:53.840> a<00:06:53.870> gun<00:06:54.140> where<00:06:54.440> i<00:06:54.470> had<00:06:54.830> a<00:06:55.450> total<00:06:56.450> of<00:06:56.480> three

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
did a gun where i had a total of three

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.930 
did a gun where i had a total of three
different<00:06:57.080> stencils<00:06:57.530> and<00:06:57.980> I<00:06:58.520> just<00:06:58.730> kept

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
different stencils and I just kept

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.340 
different stencils and I just kept
laying<00:06:59.180> them<00:06:59.420> down<00:06:59.450> in<00:06:59.870> different<00:07:00.170> patterns

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
laying them down in different patterns

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.800 
laying them down in different patterns
and<00:07:00.860> basically<00:07:01.190> even<00:07:01.910> I<00:07:02.000> was<00:07:02.150> using<00:07:02.300> on<00:07:02.540> same

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
and basically even I was using on same

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.200 
and basically even I was using on same
stencil<00:07:03.140> almost<00:07:03.590> every<00:07:03.920> time<00:07:04.160> each<00:07:04.790> one<00:07:05.030> look

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
stencil almost every time each one look

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.930 
stencil almost every time each one look
unique<00:07:05.600> simply<00:07:06.500> because<00:07:06.830> I<00:07:07.070> just<00:07:07.250> rotated<00:07:07.850> it

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
unique simply because I just rotated it

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.450 
unique simply because I just rotated it
a<00:07:07.970> little<00:07:08.150> bit<00:07:08.360> and<00:07:08.570> it's<00:07:09.440> really<00:07:09.860> easy<00:07:10.070> to<00:07:10.190> do

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
a little bit and it's really easy to do

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.090 
a little bit and it's really easy to do
that<00:07:10.640> kind<00:07:10.820> of<00:07:10.940> thing<00:07:11.000> and<00:07:11.450> get<00:07:11.950> you<00:07:12.950> know<00:07:13.040> a

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
that kind of thing and get you know a

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.370 
that kind of thing and get you know a
unique-looking<00:07:13.520> stencil<00:07:14.240> with<00:07:15.050> really

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
unique-looking stencil with really

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.780 
unique-looking stencil with really
almost<00:07:15.500> networking<00:07:16.250> you<00:07:16.370> can<00:07:16.490> just<00:07:16.640> take<00:07:16.730> a

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:16.790 
almost networking you can just take a

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.730 
almost networking you can just take a
box<00:07:17.060> cutter<00:07:17.330> or<00:07:17.570> a<00:07:17.690> hobby<00:07:18.110> knife<00:07:18.320> and<00:07:18.590> just<00:07:18.650> cut

quickly<00:07:30.770> I<00:07:30.920> took<00:07:31.120> the<00:07:32.120> barrel<00:07:32.390> extension<00:07:32.570> for

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
quickly I took the barrel extension for

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.440 
quickly I took the barrel extension for
this<00:07:33.110> gun<00:07:33.350> and<00:07:33.650> I<00:07:34.100> just<00:07:34.340> painted<00:07:34.580> it<00:07:34.880> green

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.450 
this gun and I just painted it green

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.230 
this gun and I just painted it green
with<00:07:36.290> a<00:07:36.320> couple<00:07:36.650> of<00:07:36.740> black<00:07:37.460> and<00:07:37.760> brown

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
with a couple of black and brown

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.150 
with a couple of black and brown
splotches<00:07:38.690> nothing<00:07:39.320> too<00:07:39.440> fancy<00:07:39.620> but<00:07:39.830> sort<00:07:40.100> of

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 
splotches nothing too fancy but sort of

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.420 
splotches nothing too fancy but sort of
matches<00:07:40.340> the<00:07:40.610> camo<00:07:40.850> and<00:07:41.240> on<00:07:42.110> the<00:07:42.380> the<00:07:42.770> bipod<00:07:43.190> I

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
matches the camo and on the the bipod I

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.280 
matches the camo and on the the bipod I
taped<00:07:43.760> off<00:07:43.970> that<00:07:44.360> the<00:07:44.660> black<00:07:44.900> parts<00:07:45.170> that<00:07:45.260> you

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.290 
taped off that the black parts that you

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.990 
taped off that the black parts that you
see<00:07:45.470> I<00:07:45.500> taped<00:07:45.800> off<00:07:46.040> just<00:07:46.520> for<00:07:46.610> a<00:07:46.670> little<00:07:46.760> bit<00:07:46.910> of

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 
see I taped off just for a little bit of

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.210 
see I taped off just for a little bit of
contrast<00:07:47.360> and<00:07:47.660> as<00:07:47.810> you<00:07:47.960> can<00:07:48.110> see<00:07:48.140> I<00:07:48.500> sort<00:07:49.160> of

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.220 
contrast and as you can see I sort of

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.710 
contrast and as you can see I sort of
faded<00:07:49.700> the<00:07:49.790> green<00:07:50.060> so<00:07:50.300> it<00:07:50.330> starts<00:07:50.600> out<00:07:50.660> very

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 
faded the green so it starts out very

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.210 
faded the green so it starts out very
dark<00:07:51.050> at<00:07:51.170> the<00:07:51.230> bottom<00:07:51.470> it<00:07:51.590> sort<00:07:51.770> of<00:07:51.800> comes<00:07:52.010> up

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:52.220 
dark at the bottom it sort of comes up

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.920 
dark at the bottom it sort of comes up
to<00:07:52.310> get<00:07:52.430> light<00:07:52.640> at<00:07:52.760> the<00:07:52.790> top<00:07:52.850> didn't<00:07:53.840> really

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:53.930 
to get light at the top didn't really

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.510
