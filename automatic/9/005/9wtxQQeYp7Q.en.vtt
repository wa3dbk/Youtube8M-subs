change the water okay about two three

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.250 
change the water okay about two three
times<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.850> says<00:01:06.090> three<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.630> let's<00:01:06.660> just<00:01:07.170> go

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
times this says three so let's just go

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.290 
times this says three so let's just go
with<00:01:07.410> that<00:01:07.440> but<00:01:08.010> anyway<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.000> change

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
with that but anyway you want to change

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.940 
with that but anyway you want to change
it<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.990> mean<00:01:10.290> you're<00:01:10.440> letting<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.740> sit

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it because I mean you're letting it sit

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
it because I mean you're letting it sit
there<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.160> about<00:01:11.340> ten<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.180> minutes<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there for about ten or so minutes and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
there for about ten or so minutes and
the<00:01:12.960> waters<00:01:13.260> getting<00:01:13.530> cold<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> means

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the waters getting cold and that means

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
the waters getting cold and that means
that<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> shea<00:01:15.060> butter<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.570> no<00:01:15.840> longer

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that the shea butter is no longer

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.530 
that the shea butter is no longer
melting<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.580> let<00:01:17.760> that<00:01:17.910> sit<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.240> about

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
melting so just let that sit for about

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.850 
melting so just let that sit for about
another<00:01:18.780> five<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> ten<00:01:19.740> minutes<00:01:21.590> then<00:01:22.590> once

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
another five to ten minutes then once

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
another five to ten minutes then once
you<00:01:22.979> let<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:23.310> sit<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.580> start<00:01:24.090> breaking<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you let it sit just start breaking that

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
you let it sit just start breaking that
shea<00:01:24.840> butter<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.560> mean<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.100> melts<00:01:26.460> easier

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
shea butter up I mean it melts easier

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.320 
shea butter up I mean it melts easier
when<00:01:27.660> it's<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.770> thick<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.430> any<00:01:29.729> lumps<00:01:30.180> or

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
when it's not so thick so any lumps or

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.090 
when it's not so thick so any lumps or
anything<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.320> keep<00:01:31.619> breaking<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
anything like that just keep breaking it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.010 
anything like that just keep breaking it
up<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.910> will<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.090> how<00:01:33.420> quickly<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
up and you will see how quickly this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
up and you will see how quickly this
stuff<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.470> start<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> melt<00:01:35.009> once<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.580> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
stuff will start to melt once you get it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.880 
stuff will start to melt once you get it
broken<00:01:35.880> down

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.859 

huh<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.399> now<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.729> finally<00:01:44.210> got<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.659> shea

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
butter broken down as you can see I have

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.669 
butter broken down as you can see I have
a<00:01:47.060> few<00:01:47.450> lumps<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.049> stuff<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.380> there<00:01:48.530> but

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
a few lumps and stuff in there but

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.200 
a few lumps and stuff in there but
that's<00:01:48.770> easy<00:01:49.070> just<00:01:49.399> mash<00:01:49.609> it<00:01:49.640> up<00:01:49.909> with<00:01:49.969> the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's easy just mash it up with the
