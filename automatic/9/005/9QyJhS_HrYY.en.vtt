the<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.340> thought<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> most<00:00:39.149> new<00:00:39.450> investors

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the first thought of most new investors

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
the first thought of most new investors
is<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.469> assign<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> contract<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> an<00:00:41.730> end

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is to assign the contract to an end

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.660 
is to assign the contract to an end
buyer<00:00:42.090> let<00:00:42.719> him<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.260> his<00:00:43.620> money<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> buy<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
buyer let him use his money to buy the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
buyer let him use his money to buy the
property<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.719> investor<00:00:46.289> simply

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
property and the investor simply

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.279 
property and the investor simply
collects<00:00:47.250> an<00:00:47.489> assignment<00:00:48.180> fee<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
collects an assignment fee that's the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
collects an assignment fee that's the
way<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.680> most<00:00:49.890> wholesale<00:00:50.520> transactions<00:00:51.329> are

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
way that most wholesale transactions are

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.180 
way that most wholesale transactions are
done<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.899> there's<00:00:52.079> no<00:00:52.230> money<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:52.710> credit<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
done or there's no money no credit and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.810 
done or there's no money no credit and
no<00:00:53.309> risk

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
no risk
