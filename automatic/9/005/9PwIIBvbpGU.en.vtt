00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.179
 way you know it requires 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.090
 so today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.950
 clip das 00h03 so that's already three 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.420
 weeks that this series in place 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 it's my favorite on the channel I 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.650
 not hide so it's with pleasure that I 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
 so do it you're building a building 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 television with less than forty 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.260
 quite logical as usual 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.240
 so I make a small precision by 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.179
 compared to the same 40 to these objects because 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 that my many say yeah but does 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.170
 kippas the regular is a lot 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 it was better equipped with 6 federations 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 it seems honestly I do not care 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 frankly it's not mean 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.040
 really me I think I'm going to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.590
 to say that the man 40 to saul it does 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 still since 2007 2008 that I 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 play with because it was still 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 the gray era black out 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 xn hessel short all that no I do a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.239
 video on those days soon 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.590
 in short it was a small rent so I 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.390
 not necessarily want to have fun 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.159
 regular or whatever because I'm not taking 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.020
 fun to play with and you have to 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.920
 to say that she loves the truth against 4.20 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.420
 soon die but all flow except 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 for old school players I think 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 still they have as always 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 stay on but well here is jean louis 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
 cha I want to please me I 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.509
 want to have fun again with this famous 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 40 to these objects 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.430
 that's where I made my most beautiful and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.470
 it is with this weapon that I made my 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.880
 most beautiful clips that I took the most 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.189
 of wood fun for so many years 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.600
 so I will not let go of this weapon it's 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.689
 not too bad if you see everything in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.939
 double or what ben is my choice 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 time so I do not have to force myself either 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.740
 so that was the little thing 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.140
 parenthesis and for guard some see 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 there I will not put the rule in what even 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 if I like to play so much it's clear 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.899
 but that's all I'm going to do 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.140
 then talk about the life form that I have 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.450
 made this week his king of the web 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.040
 so I think I'll do all 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.970
 Tuesday nights now ie 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.370
 that I 'm going to movies and on Tuesday nights 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.010
 for the most part Wednesday and all 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.930
 Tuesday evening around 17h 18h I will send 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.700
 a little message twitter where I 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.979
 selected from three large people 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.980
 voices that are in my opinion for issue 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.980
 different vary the call of duty kind 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 blackops mw2 or whatever but just 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.709
 lift suspension 2 how to make 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.950
 bike and tricks choices that I think about 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.840
 dreams 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.819
 I think we will be if it will be necessary 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 so I hope it could make you 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.690
 pleasure to participate in the live at all 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.739
 I like to talk - with those who 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.320
 follow and all that makes me very happy 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.790
 I answer everyone on twitter 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.739
 or other there is no problem with that 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 so I think we can do that 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.330
 can be that beats so down there I would like 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.920
 remind you of my comment yesterday 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.360
 woman maybe not all the sight it's 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.290
 maybe possible on the pack of 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.330
 varieties where I'm talking about 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.800
 smart buildings is really easy 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.360
 core ie that goes up to 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.010
 the opportunity to make a video almost 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.010
 each part is not what it is 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.440
 that hallucinating this card and even me 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 I honestly complain I do not complain of 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.370
 iron not too typical of iron between 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.950
 quotes best clip without this map 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.090
 because in the end it has no value 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.730
 like the clip that I leave you at the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.090
 frankly it's simple I have not 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.160
 to say banal but hey it's a cul here 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.070
 it is no more anything but that my clip a 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.450
 I tell you so was not going to end 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.769
 like some the bottom of my videos 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.720
 for then the club the week because 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 that I stop the capture when we click 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.950
 so inevitably it will always be at the end 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.959
 good I wanted the game know get 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.150

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.959

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.380

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.340

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.780
