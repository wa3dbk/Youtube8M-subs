a lake by paul gilbert and i'm going to
be<00:00:30.689> sort<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> trying<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> break<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
be sort of trying to break it down for

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.299 
be sort of trying to break it down for
you<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.780> guys<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.050> learn<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> its

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you so that you guys can learn it its

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
you so that you guys can learn it its
it's<00:00:36.059> basically<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:37.290> string<00:00:37.860> skipping

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's basically like string skipping

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
it's basically like string skipping
that's<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> main<00:00:38.989> main<00:00:39.989> concept<00:00:40.500> behind<00:00:40.649> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that's the main main concept behind this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.750 
that's the main main concept behind this
leg<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.600> based<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.379> minor<00:00:43.710> 7<00:00:44.100> chord

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.840 

based<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> code<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> basically<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
based on that code and so basically you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.930 
based on that code and so basically you
start<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:58.050> ring<00:00:58.800> finger<00:00:58.940> okay

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
start first with your ring finger okay

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
start first with your ring finger okay
ring<00:01:00.239> finger<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.649> 15<00:01:02.640> finally<00:01:03.180> fifth

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
ring finger on the 15 finally fifth

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
ring finger on the 15 finally fifth
straight<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> skip<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> string<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
straight and then you skip a string and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420 
straight and then you skip a string and
go<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.540> third<00:01:06.840> fret<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
go down to the third fret and use and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.840 
go down to the third fret and use and
you<00:01:08.939> start<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.659> string<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you start that string with a with your

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
you start that string with a with your
index<00:01:12.090> finger<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:14.430> hammer<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.400> fall

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
index finger on you hammer on is to fall

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
index finger on you hammer on is to fall
into<00:01:17.549> notes<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.360> middle<00:01:18.570> finger<00:01:18.960> and

after that you skip a string this one's

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.740 
after that you skip a string this one's
a<00:03:19.190> bit<00:03:19.340> tricky<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.790> spy<00:03:20.090> stricken<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:20.630> you

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
a bit tricky to spy stricken then you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.460 
a bit tricky to spy stricken then you
skip<00:03:20.990> from<00:03:21.200> drugs<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.610> first<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
skip from drugs the first to the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.530 
skip from drugs the first to the
founding<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:25.100> third<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.180> put<00:03:26.360> down

with<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.480> thing<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.780> started<00:03:33.010> with<00:03:34.010> your

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
with the thing you started with your

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.640 
with the thing you started with your
ring<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:40.150> that's<00:03:41.150> why<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.360> pull<00:03:42.170> off<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
ring so that's why you pull off to the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:51.160 
ring so that's why you pull off to the
14<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.820> two<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.450> same<00:03:44.630> strain<00:03:50.170> then

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
14 and the two of the same strain then

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.340 
14 and the two of the same strain then
you<00:03:51.290> end<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.680> on<00:03:51.890> day<00:03:52.570> 15<00:03:53.570> fess<00:03:53.900> up<00:03:53.930> fess

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
you end it on day 15 fess up fess

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:03.820 
you end it on day 15 fess up fess
trailer<00:03:54.920> personally<00:03:55.550> stopping<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:02.830> that's

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
trailer personally stopping so that's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.770 
trailer personally stopping so that's
all<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:07.790> before<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.209> want<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.510> sort<00:04:08.690> of

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
all but before you want to sort of

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.630 
all but before you want to sort of
attempt<00:04:09.440> off<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.040> might<00:04:10.220> just<00:04:10.370> want<00:04:10.580> to

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
attempt off that you might just want to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.910 
attempt off that you might just want to
break<00:04:10.850> that<00:04:11.000> down<00:04:11.209> into<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:12.380> smaller

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
break that down into and smaller

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.860 
break that down into and smaller
fragments<00:04:13.459> in<00:04:13.580> there<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.790> sue<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.720> can

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
fragments in there to sue it you can

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.599 
fragments in there to sue it you can
nail<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.380> little<00:04:15.709> bit<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.070> then<00:04:16.130> joined<00:04:16.489> on

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
nail it a little bit and then joined on

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.710 
nail it a little bit and then joined on
together<00:04:18.700> you<00:04:19.700> could<00:04:19.910> yeah<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.330> could<00:04:20.570> do

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
together you could yeah you could do

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.220 
together you could yeah you could do
that<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:22.040> first<00:04:22.070> five<00:04:22.460> notes<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.210> play<00:04:24.050> that

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
that the first five notes just play that

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.290 
that the first five notes just play that
over<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.620> over<00:04:24.710> again<00:04:24.980> just<00:04:25.250> until<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.060> get

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
over and over again just until you get

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.240 
over and over again just until you get
it<00:04:27.370> that's<00:04:28.370> good<00:04:28.640> because<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:29.300> involves<00:04:30.290> and

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
it that's good because that involves and

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.680 
it that's good because that involves and
this<00:04:31.550> link<00:04:31.760> skipping<00:04:32.150> both<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.510> string

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
this link skipping both the string

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.580 
this link skipping both the string
skipping<00:04:32.900> service<00:04:33.320> was<00:04:33.440> pretty<00:04:33.740> good<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:36.530> I

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
skipping service was pretty good so I

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:53.109 
skipping service was pretty good so I
suspect<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.280> many<00:04:37.610> slowly

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:53.119 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:58.820 

okay<00:04:54.119> so<00:04:54.259> after<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:56.959> yeah<00:04:57.959> basically<00:04:58.289> just

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
okay so after that yeah basically just

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.189 
okay so after that yeah basically just
and<00:04:59.179> then<00:05:00.179> you<00:05:00.300> sort<00:05:00.569> of<00:05:00.689> use<00:05:00.959> it<00:05:01.080> all<00:05:01.199> together

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
and then you sort of use it all together

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:19.699 
and then you sort of use it all together
sorry<00:05:04.199> about<00:05:04.439> that<00:05:15.499> and<00:05:17.599> just<00:05:18.599> try<00:05:19.259> to<00:05:19.289> be<00:05:19.559> as

skipping stress you tend to make all

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.879 
skipping stress you tend to make all
this<00:05:22.969> and<00:05:23.969> all<00:05:24.449> that<00:05:24.689> open<00:05:25.169> string<00:05:25.379> noise<00:05:25.499> is
