 even if we approach them they can 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.250
 become aggressive so we have to stay 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.570

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.770
 unexpected sight this young male to 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.770

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.790
 disruptive elements 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.919
