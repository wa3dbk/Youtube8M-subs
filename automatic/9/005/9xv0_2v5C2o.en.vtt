00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that rein back is the weakest part

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.600 
that rein back is the weakest part
normally<00:03:47.170> for<00:03:47.350> this<00:03:47.440> horse<00:03:47.710> in<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.980> test<00:03:48.220> so

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
normally for this horse in the test so

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.580 
normally for this horse in the test so
see<00:03:49.600> what<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.840> can<00:03:50.020> get<00:03:50.110> done<00:03:50.170> with<00:03:50.470> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
see what you can get done with the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.580 
see what you can get done with the
canter<00:03:50.890> work<00:03:51.960> notice<00:03:52.960> how<00:03:53.080> straight<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
canter work notice how straight the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.240 
canter work notice how straight the
horses<00:03:54.120> there<00:03:55.120> as<00:03:55.240> it<00:03:55.390> walks<00:03:55.740> it's<00:03:56.740> really

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
horses there as it walks it's really

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.400 
horses there as it walks it's really
important<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.940> keep<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.720> straightness<00:03:59.230> for

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
important to keep that straightness for

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.050 
important to keep that straightness for
the<00:03:59.500> em<00:03:59.620> judge<00:03:59.950> when<00:04:00.580> you're<00:04:00.700> getting<00:04:00.850> ready

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
the em judge when you're getting ready

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:27.370 
the em judge when you're getting ready
to<00:04:01.270> do<00:04:01.360> your<00:04:01.420> can<00:04:01.630> or<00:04:01.750> depart

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.350 

she<00:04:27.980> has<00:04:28.100> nice<00:04:28.340> changes<00:04:28.850> let's<00:04:29.060> see<00:04:29.150> if<00:04:29.210> she

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
she has nice changes let's see if she

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.940 
she has nice changes let's see if she
can<00:04:29.390> jump<00:04:29.810> up<00:04:29.960> through<00:04:30.590> them

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
can jump up through them

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.000 
can jump up through them
yeah<00:04:31.930> unfortunate<00:04:32.930> little<00:04:33.020> snort<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
yeah unfortunate little snort of the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.040 
yeah unfortunate little snort of the
knob<00:04:34.190> nostril<00:04:34.880> there<00:04:34.910> but<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.570> thought<00:04:35.930> the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
knob nostril there but I thought the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.840 
knob nostril there but I thought the
change<00:04:36.200> is<00:04:36.410> quite<00:04:36.620> nice

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.760 

the<00:04:42.390> reason<00:04:42.570> Karin<00:04:42.870> says<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.230> is<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.500> snort

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the reason Karin says that is the snort

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.070 
the reason Karin says that is the snort
naturally<00:04:44.640> if<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:44.820> imagine<00:04:45.000> how<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.840> can't

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
naturally if you imagine how you can't

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.840 
naturally if you imagine how you can't
control<00:04:46.470> where<00:04:47.130> you're<00:04:47.280> heading<00:04:47.520> their<00:04:47.670> car

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
control where you're heading their car

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.190 
control where you're heading their car
when<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.120> sneeze<00:04:48.420> it's<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> same<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.140> the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
when you sneeze it's the same for the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.600 
when you sneeze it's the same for the
horse<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.530> actually<00:04:49.830> when<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.220> judges<00:04:50.520> are

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
horse so actually when the judges are

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.610 
horse so actually when the judges are
looking<00:04:50.640> for<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.000> overall<00:04:51.360> picture<00:04:51.630> just

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
looking for that overall picture just

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.230 
looking for that overall picture just
the<00:04:52.800> head<00:04:52.920> and<00:04:53.070> neck<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.430> tiny<00:04:53.790> bit<00:04:54.060> off

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
the head and neck that tiny bit off

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.630 
the head and neck that tiny bit off
because<00:04:54.450> of<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.840> snot<00:04:55.370> whether<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.520> will

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
because of that snot whether it will

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.850 
because of that snot whether it will
