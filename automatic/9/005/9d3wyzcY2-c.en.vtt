00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the drag it's only the shift point and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.719 
the drag it's only the shift point and
later<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:40.019> this<00:00:40.199> demonstration<00:00:40.859> we<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.309> show

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:41.729 
later in this demonstration we will show

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.549 
later in this demonstration we will show
you<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> thing<00:00:42.539> actually<00:00:42.809> makes<00:00:43.350> this

demonstration explains how to set the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.590 
demonstration explains how to set the
drag<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> lever<00:00:46.589> drag<00:00:46.890> reel

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
drag on a lever drag reel

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.829 
drag on a lever drag reel
first<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:50.089> give<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.239> self<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.629> little

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
first of all give the self a little

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.209 
first of all give the self a little
slack<00:00:52.109> here<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:52.619> see<00:00:52.769> how<00:00:52.890> much<00:00:53.039> we've

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
slack here and let's see how much we've

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.099 
slack here and let's see how much we've
got<00:00:53.489> here

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
got here

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.439 
got here
that's<00:00:55.109> pretty<00:00:55.409> loose<00:00:55.619> drag<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.939> like<00:00:57.180> any

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that's pretty loose drag so like any

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.929 
that's pretty loose drag so like any
other<00:00:57.539> lever<00:00:57.989> drag<00:00:58.320> reel<00:00:58.589> we<00:00:58.799> put<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> put<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.929 --> 00:00:59.939 
other lever drag reel we put the put the

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:03.319 
other lever drag reel we put the put the
reel<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.479> neutral<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.760> over<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.119> this

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
reel in neutral and over here on this

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.350 
reel in neutral and over here on this
side<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> preset<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.729> we'll<00:01:05.909> tighten<00:01:06.149> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
side is the preset so we'll tighten that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.570 
side is the preset so we'll tighten that
up<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.690> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.220> put<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
up a little bit put it in here and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.770 
up a little bit put it in here and
change<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.759> now<00:01:11.909> obviously<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.659> you're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
change it now obviously when you're

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.969 
change it now obviously when you're
setting<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.649> to<00:01:13.709> use<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
setting this you're going to use a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.740 
setting this you're going to use a
spring<00:01:14.429> scale<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.179> sure<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> you've

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
spring scale to make sure that you've

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
spring scale to make sure that you've
got<00:01:15.959> the<00:01:16.200> exact<00:01:16.709> amount<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.310> drag<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
got the exact amount of drag that you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.630 
got the exact amount of drag that you
want<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:19.500> will<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.100> tighter<00:01:22.640> ok

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
want it will make it a little tighter ok

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
want it will make it a little tighter ok
that's<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.179> tight<00:01:24.590> okay<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.679> that's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that's pretty tight okay so that's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
that's pretty tight okay so that's
that's<00:01:26.429> in<00:01:26.670> gear<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.539> in<00:01:27.810> free<00:01:28.049> spool<00:01:28.319> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that's in gear that's in free spool you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.719 
that's in gear that's in free spool you
got<00:01:28.649> lots<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.069> free<00:01:29.310> spool<00:01:29.810> backing<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
got lots of free spool backing here and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
got lots of free spool backing here and
that<00:01:32.729> tells<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.179> how<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.360> set<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> rat<00:01:34.140> since

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that tells you how to set the rat since

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.949 
that tells you how to set the rat since
this<00:01:34.649> is<00:01:34.890> an<00:01:35.039> automatic<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:36.060> speed<00:01:36.420> real<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
this is an automatic to speed real and

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.749 
this is an automatic to speed real and
the<00:01:37.020> only<00:01:37.200> automatic<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.979> speed<00:01:38.280> reel<00:01:38.519> in<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the only automatic you speed reel in the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.089 
the only automatic you speed reel in the
world<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.899> have<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.410> nothing<00:01:40.800> all<00:01:40.950> you

has just been a demonstration to show

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.880 
has just been a demonstration to show
what<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> star<00:01:47.700> wheel<00:01:48.000> does<00:01:48.300> there's<00:01:49.259> no<00:01:49.590> need

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
what the star wheel does there's no need

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.949 
what the star wheel does there's no need
to<00:01:50.160> ever<00:01:50.459> touch<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:51.090> star<00:01:51.390> wheel<00:01:51.660> while

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
to ever touch the star wheel while

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.020 
to ever touch the star wheel while
you're<00:01:52.140> fishing<00:01:52.590> once<00:01:52.979> everything<00:01:53.670> has<00:01:53.819> been

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you're fishing once everything has been

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.499 
you're fishing once everything has been
set<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.860> we<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.099> you<00:01:56.129> to<00:01:56.670> fish<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.209> star

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
set and we like you to fish the star

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.020 
set and we like you to fish the star
wheel<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.220> way<00:01:59.369> forward<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.670> the

wheel all the way forward you have the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.679 
wheel all the way forward you have the
advantage<00:02:03.390> over<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
advantage over the

shift point although you have to do

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.070 
shift point although you have to do
nothing

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
once it's set we recommend you push it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.470 
once it's set we recommend you push it
all<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.920> way<00:02:18.160> forward<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.000> leave<00:02:19.299> it<00:02:19.450> there

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
all the way forward and leave it there

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.240 
all the way forward and leave it there
it<00:02:19.750> has<00:02:19.840> nothing<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.410> do<00:02:20.650> with<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.950> drag

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it has nothing to do with the drag

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.559 
it has nothing to do with the drag
whatsoever<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.269> we<00:02:22.420> demonstrated<00:02:23.140> earlier

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
whatsoever as we demonstrated earlier

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.500 
whatsoever as we demonstrated earlier
now<00:02:26.160> you'll<00:02:27.160> see<00:02:27.370> how<00:02:27.430> fast<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.940> dots<00:02:28.209> are

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
now you'll see how fast the dots are

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.530 
now you'll see how fast the dots are
going<00:02:28.840> by<00:02:29.129> if<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.310> would<00:02:30.580> adjust<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.510> back<00:02:31.810> off

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
going by if I would adjust it back off

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.880 
going by if I would adjust it back off
to<00:02:34.540> low<00:02:36.450> you'll<00:02:37.450> see<00:02:37.720> how<00:02:37.900> slow<00:02:38.319> they're<00:02:38.560> going

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
to low you'll see how slow they're going

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.580 
to low you'll see how slow they're going
by<00:02:40.110> right<00:02:41.110> that's<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.099> low<00:02:42.310> gear<00:02:43.590> obviously

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
by right that's in low gear obviously

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.289 
by right that's in low gear obviously
you<00:02:44.739> want<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.129> in<00:02:45.220> high<00:02:45.400> gear<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.879> gain<00:02:46.090> as

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
you want to be in high gear to gain as

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.630 
you want to be in high gear to gain as
much<00:02:46.540> possible<00:02:46.870> line<00:02:47.500> back<00:02:47.799> as<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.489> at

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
much possible line back as you can at

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.410 
much possible line back as you can at
the<00:02:48.670> right<00:02:48.970> moment<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:50.560> low<00:02:50.920> gear

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the right moment so that's low gear

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.319 
the right moment so that's low gear
that's<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.750> high<00:02:52.959> gear
