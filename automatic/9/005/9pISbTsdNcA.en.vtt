the most natural looks and the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
the most natural looks and the
maintenance<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.390> very<00:00:51.480> low<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.410> don't<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
maintenance is very low you don't get a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.760 
maintenance is very low you don't get a
hard<00:00:53.460> root<00:00:53.730> line<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> noticeable<00:00:55.320> root<00:00:55.530> line

hard root line or a noticeable root line

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
hard root line or a noticeable root line
because<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:57.120> time<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.930> demi-permanent

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
because over time the demi-permanent

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.090 
because over time the demi-permanent
color<00:00:58.890> washes<00:00:59.670> from<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.690> hair<00:01:00.930> wears<00:01:01.559> off<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
color washes from the hair wears off the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
color washes from the hair wears off the
hair<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.449> maintenance<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> would

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
hair so the maintenance for that would

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
hair so the maintenance for that would
be<00:01:04.619> every<00:01:05.159> six<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> eight<00:01:05.640> weeks

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
be every six to eight weeks

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.230 
be every six to eight weeks
the<00:01:06.510> next<00:01:06.930> process<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:08.100> use<00:01:08.340> would

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the next process that I would use would

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.890 
the next process that I would use would
be<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.740> call<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> reverse<00:01:11.340> weave<00:01:11.900> where
