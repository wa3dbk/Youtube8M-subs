00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
writing because she doesn't really like

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.820

to<00:01:22.350> journal<00:01:22.830> too<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.580> I've<00:01:24.330> done<00:01:24.830> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to journal too much so I've done you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.319 
to journal too much so I've done you
know<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.360> little<00:01:28.520> journaling<00:01:29.520> boxes<00:01:30.030> here

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
know some little journaling boxes here

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.170 
know some little journaling boxes here
but<00:01:30.509> they're<00:01:30.810> real<00:01:31.020> small<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.180> really

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
but they're real small so it really

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
but they're real small so it really
won't<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> big<00:01:33.930> deal<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.229> her<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> write<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
won't be a big deal for her to write a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.600 
won't be a big deal for her to write a
few<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.549> notes<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
few little notes on there and then the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:49.530 
few little notes on there and then the
big<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:41.009> photos<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:44.810> so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.039 

okay<00:01:50.540> then<00:01:50.900> this<00:01:51.259> one<00:01:51.500> here<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.250> did<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.509> pilote

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
okay then this one here I did of pilote

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.960 
okay then this one here I did of pilote
so<00:01:54.229> it's<00:01:54.350> got<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> little<00:01:54.710> hidden<00:01:55.159> one<00:01:55.340> in<00:01:55.490> here

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
so it's got a little hidden one in here

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.280 
so it's got a little hidden one in here
and<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.860> flips<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.640> as<00:01:58.850> well<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.450> she<00:01:59.899> can

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and then it flips up as well so she can

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.529 
and then it flips up as well so she can
put<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.500> photo<00:02:00.710> here<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.799> here<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:05.360> go

again more photos and actually I've done

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:04.870 
again more photos and actually I've done
two<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.829> one<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.350> box<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:03.880> pocket

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.229 
two in the one in the one box or pocket
here<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.269> then<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.930> flips<00:03:06.230> up<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:07.489> let<00:03:08.150> me

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
here and then that flips up so let me

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.720 
here and then that flips up so let me
see<00:03:08.359> if<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.480> get<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.780> on<00:03:08.900> camera<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.220> can

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
see if I get that on camera so that can

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.870 
see if I get that on camera so that can
be<00:03:11.620> four<00:03:12.620> photos<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.489> then<00:03:13.730> another<00:03:14.320> one<00:03:15.320> here

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
be four photos and then another one here

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.650 
be four photos and then another one here
so<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:16.910> can<00:03:17.090> see<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.420> pretty<00:03:17.690> easy<00:03:19.660> for

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
so you can see it's pretty easy for

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.400 
so you can see it's pretty easy for
adding<00:03:21.470> her<00:03:21.620> photos<00:03:22.070> too<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.760> then<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.840> did

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
adding her photos too and then I did

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.979 
these all these tags I've done using my
Cricut<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:27.829> just<00:03:28.190> changed<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> size<00:03:29.359> so<00:03:29.870> they

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
paper collection and then I created

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.620
