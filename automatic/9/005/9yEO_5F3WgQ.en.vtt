00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.049
 hello all my name matias and today they 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.760
 I'm going to teach how to make some donuts and with 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.340
 this recipe can also make the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.919
 friar balls or sigh nun or as 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.720
 want to call them is the same instead of 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.360
 make a circle with the ports of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.250
 half they make a ball and that's it and 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.720
 then they overflow it in sugar that's the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.680
 the only difference it has and the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.460
 ingredients that we are going to use are flour 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.370
 butter sugar milk eggs 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.989
 but to copy all the ingredients that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.699
 they appeared a while ago do not worry 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.379
 because it ends with the description of this 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.600
 video appear the exact amounts 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.850
 to close this recipe if you want better 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.540
 this video click here below and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.790
 will change the configuration per h of not being 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 will see with a full hd tensioner I hope 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.210
 something better 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.269
 to make the masses of the zones 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.659
 first in warm milk add the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.759
 yeast with a little sugar milk 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.860
 it has to be warm because if it heats up 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.190
 a lot of milk you're going to burn the yeast 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.800
 and then it's not going to leaven once 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.660
 milk is well dissolved, wait 5 or 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.539
 10 minutes until a 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.060
 Sponge meanwhile in a bowl add 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.570
 all the dry ingredients mix them 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.300
 a little bit add the eggs and the sponge 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.270
 of the yeast knead a little and add 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.030
 the ointment butter finishes kneading and 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.860
 Place the dough in a bowl covered with a 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.190
 repasador and let duplicate his 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 volume once this happened 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.820
 declassified the mass and 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.820
 approximately 2 centimeters 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.569
 once you threw the mace 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.489
 approximately two centimeters 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.709
 leave the home for 15 to 20 minutes more 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.450
 you do not have it very thick because this 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.609
 remember that it has yeast and then it goes 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 to owe and when the kitchen is also going 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:55.439
 to do a little more and to cut the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.439
 circles I used a ring number 8 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.110
 and a smaller one to cut him in the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.540
 center and if you want to make friar balls 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.540
 makes a little ball and cadel evans 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.819
 to make the bathroom made of retirement 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.310
 Colate coverage bathes the areas and by 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.670
 top sprinkled with grenades 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.670
 colors 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.200
 for the strawberry bath mix one 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.969
 egg white with impalpable sugar more 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.159
 or less the approximate amount of sugar 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.500
 impalpable is 200 grams does not have to 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.629
 to be a mixture neither very liquid nor very 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.310
 thick it has to be similar to the 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.620
 honey consciousness adds the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.620
 red coloring and the essence of strawberry 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 ah 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.430
 and to make the lemon bath mix 200 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.250
 grams of impalpable sugar with a little 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.260
 of lemon juice bathes the donuts leaves 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.920
