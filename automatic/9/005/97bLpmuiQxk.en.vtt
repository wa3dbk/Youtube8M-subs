Perez<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.590> anum<00:03:26.010> because<00:03:26.340> he<00:03:26.579> was<00:03:26.730> left

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
Perez and anum because he was left

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.509 
Perez and anum because he was left
footed<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.560> any<00:03:28.560> good<00:03:28.799> press<00:03:28.980> was<00:03:29.190> left<00:03:29.370> foot

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
footed and any good press was left foot

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.729 
footed and any good press was left foot
and<00:03:29.870> Alan<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.049> right<00:03:31.199> for<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.560> just

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
and Alan was right for it so I just

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.319 
and Alan was right for it so I just
basically<00:03:32.010> switched<00:03:32.340> them<00:03:32.489> around<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.180> they

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
basically switched them around so they

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.879 
basically switched them around so they
can<00:03:33.480> play<00:03:33.659> on<00:03:33.900> their<00:03:34.049> preferred<00:03:34.440> foot<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
can play on their preferred foot and

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.649 
can play on their preferred foot and
