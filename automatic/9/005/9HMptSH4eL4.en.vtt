00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.200
 ah 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.840
 the good team because little by little it has gone 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.270
 taking shape and consolidating in many 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.790
 aspects but we will always aspire to 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.700
 be in better condition 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.090
 trying to be the best football by 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.920
 course getting the results that 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.430
 we need to go on fulfilling their 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.690
 objectives the team has gone from less to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.129
 plus 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.129
 we have gone little by little looking 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.830
 and make it stronger in all the lines 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.050
 and that leads us to have the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.300
 results as I told you from a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 Start in the group has focused 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.830
 directly to that problem to be 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 clear in what we are looking for and for 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.500
 course all based on going 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.640
 winning the best level for each player 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.800
 and so together to the team to be able 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.860
 get the results is undoubtedly has 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.560
 improved that has been consolidating little 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.050
 a little but a lot is missing I never 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 I put ceilings by then you stop growing 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.610
 is how it will be that until here I arrived and that 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.550
 it would be the last thing I could do not 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 we will gradually and increasingly aspiring to 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.600
 more things when you get closer to the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 objectives of course that excites and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.780
 that encourages you very much to be very clear what 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 that we can not lose sight of is to be 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.760
 the approach we must take to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 achieve that I never underestimate 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.290
 absolutely nothing I try to see all 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 the aspects everything that counts 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.259
 around a team to be able to have 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.500
 the best reference and the best sample 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.050
 is that the team that are hardest hit 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.909
 he's always with an ex so that's why 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.909
 will be waiting for the best rival
