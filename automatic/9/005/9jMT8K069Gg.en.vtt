00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the cord here and of course there are

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.509 
the cord here and of course there are
always<00:02:38.730> exceptions<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:40.799> music<00:02:41.160> but

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.460 

okay<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.129> this<00:03:00.280> time<00:03:01.080> signatures<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.170> what

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
okay so this time signatures like what

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.050 
okay so this time signatures like what
we<00:03:02.590> call<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.890> compound<00:03:03.599> types<00:03:04.599> of<00:03:04.810> George's<00:03:05.290> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
we call a compound types of George's in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.580 
we call a compound types of George's in
think<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.299> guess<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.659> in<00:03:07.840> six<00:03:08.170> eight<00:03:08.379> or

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
think of it I guess in in six eight or

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.300 
think of it I guess in in six eight or
twelve<00:03:08.890> eight

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
twelve eight

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.680 
twelve eight
it's<00:03:09.610> probably<00:03:09.909> in<00:03:10.000> twelve<00:03:10.330> eight<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.569> would

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
it's probably in twelve eight I would

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.440 
it's probably in twelve eight I would
imagine<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.709> we<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.519> groups<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.209> three

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
imagine but we have groups of three

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.420 
imagine but we have groups of three
nodes<00:03:13.659> is<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.140> what<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.769> means<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.310> know

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
nodes is what what that means you know

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.080 
nodes is what what that means you know
to<00:03:15.610> us<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:15.940> one<00:03:16.420> two<00:03:16.750> three<00:03:20.519> all<00:03:21.519> right<00:03:21.580> I'll

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
to us so one two three all right I'll

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.300 
to us so one two three all right I'll
just<00:03:22.120> keep<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.660> left<00:03:22.870> hand<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.920> steady

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
just keep the left hand in a steady

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.130 
just keep the left hand in a steady
rhythm<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.209> then<00:03:25.480> place<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.930> right<00:03:26.110> hand

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
rhythm and then place the right hand

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.680 
rhythm and then place the right hand
wherever<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.190> have<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> vertical<00:03:27.970> line<00:03:28.360> there

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
wherever I have a vertical line there

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.400 
wherever I have a vertical line there
and<00:03:28.810> work<00:03:29.019> out

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.850 

okay<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:36.940> then<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.120> continue<00:03:37.540> on<00:03:37.720> here<00:03:38.110> and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
okay so and then we continue on here and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.590 
okay so and then we continue on here and
we're<00:03:39.040> going<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.190> have<00:03:39.400> change<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.270> left<00:03:40.450> hand

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
we're going to have change the left hand

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.330 
we're going to have change the left hand
to<00:03:40.690> an<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.870> minor<00:03:41.140> chord<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.800> little<00:03:42.250> bit

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
different voicing though we're gonna

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.620 
different voicing though we're gonna
have<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> low<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> here<00:03:45.160> up<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.000> an<00:03:46.150> e<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.600> the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.400 
okay the technique for octaves you want
to<00:06:53.310> look<00:06:53.760> at<00:06:54.150> your<00:06:54.540> thumb<00:06:54.810> if<00:06:55.050> you<00:06:55.080> look<00:06:55.290> at

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
to look at your thumb if you look at

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.020 
to look at your thumb if you look at
your<00:06:55.560> hand<00:06:55.770> you<00:06:55.860> want<00:06:56.040> to<00:06:56.100> feel<00:06:56.340> the<00:06:56.550> thumb<00:06:56.790> and

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
your hand you want to feel the thumb and

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.910 
your hand you want to feel the thumb and
then<00:06:57.450> measure<00:06:57.840> with<00:06:58.200> the<00:06:58.290> pinky<00:06:58.590> because<00:06:58.710> you

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
then measure with the pinky because you

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.590 
then measure with the pinky because you
can't<00:06:59.100> really<00:06:59.250> look<00:06:59.370> at<00:06:59.520> both<00:06:59.670> fingers<00:07:00.060> watch

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
can't really look at both fingers watch

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.250 
can't really look at both fingers watch
your<00:07:00.870> thumb<00:07:02.480> again<00:07:03.480> it's<00:07:03.600> all<00:07:03.750> in<00:07:03.930> the<00:07:04.020> wrist

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
your thumb again it's all in the wrist

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.970 
your thumb again it's all in the wrist
have<00:07:04.800> a<00:07:04.830> higher<00:07:05.130> higher<00:07:05.820> risk<00:07:06.210> of<00:07:06.360> normal<00:07:06.980> and

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
have a higher higher risk of normal and

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.780 
have a higher higher risk of normal and
it's<00:07:08.280> it's<00:07:08.730> like<00:07:08.940> this<00:07:09.830> okay

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:15.790 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.780 

so<00:07:16.790> that's<00:07:17.000> the<00:07:17.120> key<00:07:17.300> firm<00:07:18.550> playing<00:07:19.550> octaves

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
so that's the key firm playing octaves

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.970 
so that's the key firm playing octaves
as<00:07:20.180> it<00:07:20.330> gets<00:07:20.480> all<00:07:20.660> in<00:07:20.840> the<00:07:20.960> wrist<00:07:21.169> which<00:07:21.710> a<00:07:21.830> lot

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
as it gets all in the wrist which a lot

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.610 
as it gets all in the wrist which a lot
of<00:07:22.010> things<00:07:22.250> are<00:07:22.460> now<00:07:28.240> what<00:07:29.240> I<00:07:29.270> did<00:07:29.510> also<00:07:29.900> is<00:07:30.380> on
