and certainly in my career there were

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
and certainly in my career there were
many<00:00:51.750> academics<00:00:52.410> who<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.010> study<00:00:53.219> failure

many academics who have to study failure
I'm<00:00:53.820> much<00:00:54.149> worse<00:00:54.329> than<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> opposite<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> one

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I'm much worse than the opposite and one

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.139 
I'm much worse than the opposite and one
of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> beauties<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> being<00:00:56.760> interested<00:00:56.940> in

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
of the beauties of being interested in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.490 
of the beauties of being interested in
success<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:57.899> plenty<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> out

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

there

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
there
and<00:00:59.219> certainly<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.270> terms<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.930> great

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and certainly in terms of what great

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
and certainly in terms of what great
schools<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.160> feel<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:03.480> that

schools look look like feel like is that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.539 
schools look look like feel like is that
there<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.290> inviting<00:01:04.799> places<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.280> kids<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
there are inviting places for kids to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.520 
there are inviting places for kids to
learn<00:01:05.670> kids<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
learn kids actually want to be there and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
learn kids actually want to be there and
that<00:01:08.070> notion<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.700> having<00:01:09.270> schools

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that notion of having schools

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
that notion of having schools
particularly<00:01:10.260> high<00:01:10.740> schools<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.250> kids

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
particularly high schools where kids

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
particularly high schools where kids
want<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:13.380> join<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
want to be there and they join the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
want to be there and they join the
engagement<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.060> learning<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.049> really

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
engagement of learning that is really

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.999 
engagement of learning that is really
what<00:01:16.650> matters

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
what matters

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.789 
what matters
certainly<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> primary<00:01:18.689> schools<00:01:18.930> kids<00:01:19.560> make

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
certainly in primary schools kids make

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
certainly in primary schools kids make
the<00:01:19.979> decision<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:20.850> staying<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.509> thing

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the decision about staying in this thing

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
the decision about staying in this thing
called<00:01:21.900> school<00:01:22.140> around<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> age<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> 10<00:01:23.070> 11<00:01:23.310> 12

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
called school around the age of 10 11 12

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.630 
called school around the age of 10 11 12
so<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:23.970> pretty<00:01:24.240> important<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so it's pretty important then to that it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
so it's pretty important then to that it
is<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.850> great<00:01:27.150> place<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.509> learn<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is a great place to learn one of the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.050 
is a great place to learn one of the
things<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.490> great<00:01:29.520> place<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
things that make it a great place to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
things that make it a great place to
learn<00:01:30.240> besides<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.110> safety<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> sense

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
learn besides the safety and the sense

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.999 
learn besides the safety and the sense
of<00:01:32.159> fairness<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> students<00:01:34.009> continually

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
of fairness is that students continually

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.679 
of fairness is that students continually
get<00:01:35.280> information<00:01:35.490> about<00:01:36.150> their<00:01:36.509> progress

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
get information about their progress

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.620 
get information about their progress
like<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.920> us<00:01:37.979> no<00:01:38.430> matter<00:01:38.549> who<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.270> what

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
like all of us no matter who we are what

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
like all of us no matter who we are what
business<00:01:40.049> won't<00:01:40.259> work<00:01:40.409> we're<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.610> know

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
business won't work we're like to know

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.080 
business won't work we're like to know
we're<00:01:42.299> having<00:01:42.479> an<00:01:42.570> impact<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> many<00:01:43.860> kids<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
we're having an impact so many kids and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
we're having an impact so many kids and
so<00:01:45.270> new<00:01:45.329> teachers<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.280> teachers<00:01:47.280> who<00:01:47.430> know

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so new teachers and teachers who know

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
so new teachers and teachers who know
what<00:01:47.939> their<00:01:48.119> impact<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> are<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> ones<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
what their impact is are the ones that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.380 
what their impact is are the ones that
have<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> greatest<00:01:50.460> dividends<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> kids

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
have the greatest dividends for the kids

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.240 
have the greatest dividends for the kids
and<00:01:52.110> certainly<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.710> research<00:01:53.009> work<00:01:53.250> shows

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
and certainly all my research work shows

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.890 
and certainly all my research work shows
it's<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.670> teacher<00:01:54.880> it's<00:01:55.150> when<00:01:55.330> teachers<00:01:55.720> know

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
it's the teacher it's when teachers know

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.710 
it's the teacher it's when teachers know
who<00:01:56.650> they're<00:01:56.830> having<00:01:57.010> an<00:01:57.100> impact<00:01:57.400> with<00:01:58.000> what

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
who they're having an impact with what

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.690 
who they're having an impact with what
have<00:01:58.900> you<00:01:58.990> impact<00:01:59.290> about<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.860> what<00:02:00.550> that

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
have you impact about and what that

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.640 
have you impact about and what that
magnitude<00:02:01.150> of<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.390> impact<00:02:01.660> is<00:02:01.870> there<00:02:02.560> are

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
magnitude of that impact is there are

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.410 
magnitude of that impact is there are
the<00:02:02.770> ones<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.130> tend<00:02:03.910> to<00:02:04.000> be<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.330> most

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
the ones that tend to be the most

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.870 
the ones that tend to be the most
successful<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.080> most<00:02:05.380> passionate<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.220> have

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
successful the most passionate and have

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.240 
successful the most passionate and have
the<00:02:07.090> biggest<00:02:07.300> difference<00:02:07.690> on<00:02:07.810> kids<00:02:08.020> lives<00:02:08.259> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the biggest difference on kids lives and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.400 
the biggest difference on kids lives and
so<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:10.030> deliberately<00:02:10.869> haven't<00:02:11.140> mentioned

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
so I deliberately haven't mentioned

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.530 
so I deliberately haven't mentioned
things<00:02:11.530> like<00:02:11.770> test<00:02:12.010> scores<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.550> scores<00:02:13.210> on

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
things like test scores and scores on

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.960 
things like test scores and scores on
standardized<00:02:14.050> systems<00:02:14.770> whatever<00:02:14.980> not<00:02:15.820> that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
standardized systems whatever not that

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.490 
standardized systems whatever not that
they're<00:02:16.090> unimportant<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:17.020> they<00:02:17.140> don't<00:02:17.320> rank

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
they're unimportant but they don't rank

they're unimportant but they don't rank
that<00:02:17.740> highly<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:19.390> many<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.690> our<00:02:19.810> kids<00:02:20.050> going

that highly for many of our kids going
to<00:02:20.680> school<00:02:20.920> isn't<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.370> about<00:02:21.760> getting<00:02:22.030> high

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

areas if I could think of one thing I
would<00:02:53.650> want<00:02:53.680> schools<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.250> worry<00:02:54.550> about<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:55.240> own

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
kids going through that system is that

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.550 
kids going through that system is that
they<00:02:57.160> would<00:02:57.340> teach<00:02:57.550> them<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.209> effort<00:02:58.560> is

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
they would teach them that effort is

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.500 
they would teach them that effort is
what<00:02:59.739> makes<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.070> difference<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:01.300> teach

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
what makes the difference that teach

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.570 
what makes the difference that teach
them<00:03:01.690> about<00:03:01.930> how<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.170> concentrate<00:03:02.590> how<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> be

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
them about how to concentrate how to be

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
persistent what to do when you don't

know what to do now those things are

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.290 
know what to do now those things are
really<00:03:08.739> important<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:09.370> they<00:03:09.700> do<00:03:09.760> have<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.209> be

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
really important but they do have to be

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.180 
really important but they do have to be

anchored in some subject matter and
there<00:03:12.730> are<00:03:12.760> lots<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.060> different<00:03:13.330> subject

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
there are lots of different subject

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.570 
there are lots of different subject
matters<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.989> are<00:03:14.050> critical<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.620> me<00:03:14.890> for<00:03:15.400> kids

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
matters that are critical to me for kids

who<00:03:15.670> go<00:03:15.790> through<00:03:15.820> schools<00:03:16.300> there<00:03:16.630> are

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
who go through schools there are

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.780 
who go through schools there are
multiple<00:03:17.110> ways<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.560> being<00:03:18.010> excited<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.550> school

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
multiple ways of being excited in school

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.570 
multiple ways of being excited in school
when<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.720> comes<00:03:19.900> down<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:21.280> biggest

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
when it comes down to it the biggest

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.270 
when it comes down to it the biggest
power<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.940> school<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.739> impact<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
power of the school is the impact of the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.289 
power of the school is the impact of the
teachers<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.380> have<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> lot<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.250> faith<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
teachers and so I have a lot of faith I

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.940 
teachers and so I have a lot of faith I
have<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.540> lot<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.780> evidence<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> lot<00:03:29.920> of

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
have a lot of evidence I have a lot of

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.410 
have a lot of evidence I have a lot of
authority<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.640> would<00:03:30.820> like<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.150> put<00:03:31.330> on

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
authority that I would like to put on

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.060 
authority that I would like to put on
the<00:03:31.510> notion<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.870> excellent<00:03:32.650> teachers<00:03:32.950> are

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
the notion that excellent teachers are

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.949 
the notion that excellent teachers are
what<00:03:33.220> drive<00:03:33.430> our<00:03:33.610> system<00:03:33.970> when<00:03:34.660> they're<00:03:34.810> led

that's a pretty impressive pace place to
be<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:32.360> have<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.630> lot<00:04:32.720> better<00:04:32.960> than<00:04:33.139> being<00:04:33.260> 49th
