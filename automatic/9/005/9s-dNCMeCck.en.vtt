00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 good 28 times that we are new video 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.170
 according to quite curious way and the truth 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.689
 is that I never knew before that there was no 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.310
 have no idea or the slightest idea 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.410
 existed good I have the games of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.560
 hungry but for a single version 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560
 player 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.859
 for a player to understand us better 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.400
 this way what he does is how to play the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.100
 game to the game of hunger 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.550
 the mod creates a series of characters to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.000
 other players like few votes 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.500
 what iu 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.650
 in general this spot these players and 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.270
 good the mod own machine control 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.920
 the two players and you play then 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.390
 good as if it was a normal game or 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.239
 Hunger games ' normal is worth as much as I 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.579
 I see as good for playing online 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.679
 start 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.710
 once we open the game it will open 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.839
 this will open with this object and what 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.689
 we have to do it right click if 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.070
 will not open this and we will give jazz 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.250
 well this is the countdown here 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.140
 we will choose I do not know for example 15 seconds 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.320
 or 10 seconds for example this is what 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.940
 it takes 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.750
 what it takes to start the game of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.750
 hungry vale 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.409
 that more monarchical power the tribe I 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.329
 I recommend leaving it as it is but good 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.210
 here he tells you so you start with 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.760
 Some items are worth leaving in 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.480
 true 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.930
 tribe of strange this is the 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.010
 the difficulty of each tribe decade 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.230
 each person of each player 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.550
 weak the name leave it like this is it does not 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.550
 it needs to be changed and well these are 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.000
 if there is spam 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.420
 if you see the names of other players 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.530
 and if the biome play once 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 configured in another taste 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.640
 start and as you see here below puts the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.049
 time left to start the game 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.330
 of hunger that we have put before 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.350
 setting up well now we are going to 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.610
 watch 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.350
 how the hunger game starts 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.230
 I'm going to start the hunger game as 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.660
 You see there are people and there they come already 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.500
 is already done with new objects 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.540
 you see that there is such a brutus is to follow 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.540
 in him but I do not see it and good as you see 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.560
 it's the same as the games of the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.230
 hunger I think it's started I think 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.770
 or something like that or the truth I do not know 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.380
 what is that but good kids 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.830

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.189
 minecraft number 45 is worth so if not 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.140

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.690
 of the hunger games for minecraft 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.760
 moment 4.5 we hope to finish the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.819
 advertising seconds and we'll give you in 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.819
 skip advertising while we're going to go 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.260
 let's go putting this on 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.390
 we will give you all the publicity 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.580
 and it is already 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.140
 what we have to do is pass all 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.240
 the files that we have downloaded with the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.890
 ader module and the hunger games' 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.540
 to the desk to work 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.340
 better with them 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.100
 that gives this to be removed 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.390
 some ways I had 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.670
 but this does not need the others ok 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.220
 so good nothing 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.330
 this step to omit them if you have it already if 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.860
 it is that it is already clean 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.570
 once this is done we will open the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.920
 Minecraft point folder as always 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.220
 for this we will open execute and 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.830
 we will write % app back percent and you 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.520
 we will give the accept 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.350
 minecraft point minecraft bean minecraft 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.860
 points right click 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.860
 winrar 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.540
 what we have to do to open the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.450
 model will see and pass all I take 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.060
 let's give it adela minecraft dot heart 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.860
 we are and we eliminate the folder in meta 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.930
 and from our minecraft point jaro ok yes 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.840
 we our imagination is back 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.960
 and it does not work once this is done 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.760
 we close the minecraft point heart and 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.680
 we go back to our point folder 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.780
 minecraft open the mod folder 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.390
 if we keep the mobile and right 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.810
 new folder and we put the name 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.750
 mod 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.220
 ok we will open the mod folder and as already 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.830
 I have here another here many but good 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.690
 They do not work because it gives you a city like that 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.370
 Well, there's no problem 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.780
 we will drag only from the games of 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.670

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.169
 and we're going to check that our 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.400
 machine works perfectly 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.400
 so you do not have any doubt 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.460
