00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.910
 of my previous participation before 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:12.230
 you gentlemen on the subject of the law 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.290
 of animal abuse that then motivated a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.920
 comment from don edgardo I think 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.290
 relevant to make some 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.600
 to refine what my participation was 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.670
 previous and once also this 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.599
 react to what manifested by don 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.559
 edgardo araya this law that is being 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.300
 processing in the environment committee 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.670
 This is called code reform 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.020
 criminal law and reforms to the welfare law 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.590
 of the animals there is 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.860
 provisions in the penal code and in the 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.559
 in the animal welfare law they have 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.420
 what to do with the subject that occupies and concerns 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.890
 a lot of people all here are 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.920
 making the modifications for 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.970
 increase penalties improve criminal types 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.680
 expand criminal types to sanction 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.829
 behaviors that have to do with your 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 animals 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.740
 accuracy for those who are 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.330
 pointing to the libertarian movement the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.009
 deputy natalia díaz and to this server 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.049
 as the hindrances of this 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.440
 project to tell you what is 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.870
 absolutely false 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.590
 the libertarian movement party is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.040
 in favor of penalizing violence the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.260
 hurt the mistreatment of animals in that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.640
 we totally agree as 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.040
 block however however the way 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.650
 to the hell say they are paved with 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.920
 very good intentions and that's where 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.440
 I enter into a mentionable analysis 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.180
 some issues of the bill that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.180
 they have very serious problems 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.050
 important to make it very clear that none 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.580
 deputies of the libertarian movement and ni 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.590
 Doña Natalia Díaz and I, who are we? 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.680
 signers of some of those motions 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.210
 we've talked a single minute in any 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.370
 of those motions in the commission of 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.110
 environment as you can tell the gift 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.180
 edgardo araya gerardo vargas red that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.900
 they are part of that commission 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.119
 so presenting motions is not 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.350
 stopping the process if you 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.750
 they would like in the environment commission 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.380
 can approve a waiver motion 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.450
 reading and in five minutes discard the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.850
 40 motions that we present that is something 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.250
 what they can do is the project and 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.950
 is in the environment commission are 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.890
 you who have it there for 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.690
 bring it to the full report I already have 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.150
 here the report with the three days of 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.489
 emotion to 137 to kill him the last day 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.930
 of motions and with that last and emotions 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.790
 you transact speaks the commission of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.550
 environment in that we do not have anything 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.080
 what to see I hope you welcome 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.570
 many of the motions that we 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.540
 we have presented to improve the text 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.920
 motions that were proposed to 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.930
 we for the national chamber of 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.600
 worried agribusiness agriculture 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.880
 how are the productive sector that a 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.540
 how is the reaction on the third day of 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.950
 emotions affect the livestock sector 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.800
 affects egg production 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.170
 industrial because laying hens 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.470
 they are in a situation 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.970
 of anguish of anguish we are at par 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.209
 from the other a very limited space with 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.760
 a light almost 24 hours obviously falls 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.640
 in the criminal category that is established 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.620
 in this law then good if it is not done 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.180
 a modification obviously we will have 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.819
 shortage of eggs because only 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.420
 grazing eggs we would then have what 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.840
 same can be applied for what is the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.000
 chickens what is the one that makes props 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.040
 industrial for the bird 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.560
 the chicken meat the same we can 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.900
 talk about cattle stabling a cattle 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.459
 put in one with a very space 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.470
 reduced eating and eating eating 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.280
 for the purpose of fattening it for later 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.140
 take it to kill good that's in a 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.690
 in one it is not an anguish and a stress 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.430
 that could perfectly warm between 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.980
 the assumptions of the crimes 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.910
 established here and not to mention the limits 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.769
 the assemblies of all and the 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.810
 thematic runs but the stops 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.360
 are excluded the horseback rides are not 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.280
 excluding cultural activities that 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.230
 there are around 6 of the pig on Saturday 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.450
 are not excluded the lizard of 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.180
 guard and friend ronald vargas is not 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.030
 excluding this and the mule race of 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.090
 parrita is not excluded or is there a 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.430
 series of cultural activities very 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.530
 the essence and the idiosyncrasy the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.110
 Costa Ricans who are not excluded and 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.270
 therefore it would be a crime if these were 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.919
 did and again we call the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.510
 attention on that we present motions 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.240
 for the purpose of ex 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.060
 it's cultural activities but then 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.600
 ladies and gentlemen, do you know what the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.610
 sanction for injuring a human being 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.969
 another human being 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.460
 do you know what is the sanction for 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:58.210
 cause injury to one human being to another 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.000
 human being from three months to a year 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.639
 jail they know what the selection is 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.569
 injure an animal from one year to three 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.490
 years of jail 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.679
 see if we are not in a 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.759
 nonsense in relation to the proportion 

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:15.409
 of penalties injuring a human being of 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.139
 three months to a year 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:23.330
 injure an animal from one year to three 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.039
 years obviously this does not break all the 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.539
 proportionality established in our 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.149
 legal system in criminal matters 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.219
 regarding the hierarchical structure of 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:33.259
 the protected legal rights being the 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.909
 well that is on the cusp of that 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.610
 pyramid of protected legal rights 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.830
 human life secondly 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.899
 physical integrity of the human being 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.039
 property rights and there goes down 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.469
 in the legal property structure 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:49.819
 supervised and then we can locate 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.300
 other other animals things objects 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.460
 etcetera but 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.539
 could compare your animal with a being 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.270
 human and sanction three times stronger 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.030
 the injury to an animal that to a being 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.500
 human then I do the so-called attention 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.210
 so that the companions of a whole 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.009
 environment commission at the time of 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.710
 process the emotions take into account 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.599
 this and again it is not that we are in 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.620
 against penalizing animal abuse 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.900
 we are in favor of penalizing it but if 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.690
 calling attention to a topic like 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.699
 this where there are many emotions be 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.469
 involved you can take to the assembly 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.379
 legislative to make decisions 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:30.479
 wrong to legislate there are 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.180
 do it with the head with the heart 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.310
 cold you have to do it analyzing very well 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.530
 the consequences of all acts and 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.270
 a project like this that although it is 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.280
 true we feel empathy to all 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.180
 Costa Ricans with the theme you can 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.550
 wear 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.650
 to affect livestock production we 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.870
 can lead to affect traditions and 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.310
 can lead us to crack the 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.949
 hierarchical structure of goods 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.380
 legal services giving more value to 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.150
 life or physical integrity in this 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.030
 case of an animal that to integrity 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.840
 physical of a human being I'm not of 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:09.120
 agreement never to sanction 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:12.479
 the injury to an animal is three times more 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.529
 It is worthwhile to sanction the injury to 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:18.440
 a human being thank you very much ladies 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:22.030
 thank you deputy, you're 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.030
 Gonzalo Ramírez is to continue
