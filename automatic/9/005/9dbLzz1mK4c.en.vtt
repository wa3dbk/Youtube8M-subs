 Hello to my review of my test video for Esther Babel and 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.290

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.779
 2010 and then closes again many many have tested it and he indeed 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.130
 You can not buy that I had already some where from synonymous 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.179
 asked and Fighting Media - Shop and everyone I never had 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.220

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.379
 this is the phone rings in St table of contents so always see 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.770
 what they all and Ramos 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.940
 one has here table of contents and Hessen of our side deletes one 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.440
 Percent she walks all over Chile playfully they are without coat entertainment 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.129
 Creativity live his last rehearsal 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.729
 Productivity education and sports the Samsung for the deposit we march so 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.080
 then have it as he again right 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.290
 in% there are still smaller sections divided really well 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.220
 finds 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.069
 and then 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.669
 There are more that you can download if I tell you too 

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:03.410
 no matter what the good for 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.900
 Here you have first explained all iphone models in the overview differences 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.549
 and so 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.190
 Pepper bag models 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.690
 in the overview of markets, however, so the App Store for iPhone nobody 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.750
 must register and and what can do wrong and so on 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.670
 around 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 then you did not really know what happened in his conversation with you 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.420
 journalists 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810
 Reforms to Corp 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.789
 turn and then you get there 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:29.840
 because she does not 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.620
 but that's really about it 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.860
 Interview with an example of the manufacturer and how he imagines it 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.960
 Siemens wants to do that too 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.640
 contains the iPhone as a game 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.940
 I think that's really cool, I can do that too 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.990
 really interesting then so we test the iphone app XVI 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.720
 and again the Living itself the editorial you can then on 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.480
 watch 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.780
 And now you can already start right away with news that is also something new 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.160
 compared to the other percent 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.119
 expenditure 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 So for the last elections and here is synonymous percent why 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.190
 you can read it again on the left gives his Mason at the beginning 6 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.060
 Bacon man at Formalien man 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.259
 a woman from Oman here 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.860
 2 Cor Moritz Kaup at 1 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.120
 why do you usually look under 1 with it overshadowing a year then keep it up 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.739
 have 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.119
 Here is everything in it what you have to open so 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.349
 and here below is still percent come 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.520
 that is the manufacturer then sometimes the side of the price 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.029
 then the App Store review ion system is obviously clear 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.869
 and here is this Apple Inc and when we come this 1 and if they themselves 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.979
 from this duchess 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.699
 since I can simply enter this code and then the directly or then 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.539
 You do not get that over yourself yet over the centuries 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:48.570
 forwarded 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.790
 I have not tried that yet, then enough and then there is yes 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.749
 another review by MetLife 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 these are the Erwin actors the authors and I really want it 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.469
 made really cool "There are also such 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.379
 if Spain and Britain 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.829
 to such a recommendation which you should definitely get and around 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.559
 the winter games pretty cool 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.999
 That's why I find the review always good to eat as well as some 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.519
 Spelling mistakes in there are still some for me but that's me too 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.809
 not very bad 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.279
 Percent 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.339
 been 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.350
 the lions are then often themselves 6 Frankfurt 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.779
 that they are 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.619
 Timo go to iPhone locations this is of course only for iphone owners 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:29.539
 Interesting 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.959
 they are still available as accessories and Voser St "What that can be is 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.939
 always really nice and 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.609
 we are normal EPS in the survey 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.599
 with prices left to websites at 8 percent 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.919
 after the alphabet 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.309
 sorted 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.909
 and just here you can see 333 Apsis Nerlinger 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.229
 I can really give this as rewarded as it costs Felix Krull 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.889
 and let me relax 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.650
 Percent here, too, it is obviously around him so far only in 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.239
 Internet seen so here with me in the small village so it does not exist 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.109
 Percent maybe there is still somewhere else in magazines specialty shop 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.949
 but one more 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.099
 I think they are definitely good for those who want to rummage around the Mambas 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.349
 and who complain to me that I have too little program I'm up here 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.409
 In any case enough in it all the big players are tested is too 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.409
 relatively current has not seen so long outside 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.020
 Ehingen enthusiastic games player game I think it's beautiful now 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.159
