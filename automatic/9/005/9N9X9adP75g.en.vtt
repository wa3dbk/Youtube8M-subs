00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.690 
another important thing about
synchronous<00:03:28.560> siteswap<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.400> there<00:03:29.550> are

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
synchronous siteswap is that there are

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.330 
synchronous siteswap is that there are
no<00:03:29.910> odd<00:03:30.120> numbers<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.500> throw<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.950> meant<00:03:32.160> to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
no odd numbers so if a throw is meant to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.449 
no odd numbers so if a throw is meant to
cross<00:03:32.610> from<00:03:33.569> one<00:03:33.599> hand<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.349> other<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:35.280> will

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
cross from one hand to the other it will

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.070 
cross from one hand to the other it will
be<00:03:35.580> an<00:03:35.730> even<00:03:36.000> number<00:03:36.120> followed<00:03:36.870> by<00:03:36.930> a

be an even number followed by a
lowercase<00:03:37.709> X<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:39.150> example<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.780> 4x<00:03:40.349> would<00:03:41.310> look

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
lowercase X for example a 4x would look

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.380 
lowercase X for example a 4x would look
something<00:03:41.670> like<00:03:41.879> this<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:43.410> 6x<00:03:44.150> would<00:03:45.150> look

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
something like this and a 6x would look

like this

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.130 
like this
and<00:03:46.730> since<00:03:47.730> there<00:03:47.970> are<00:03:48.150> no<00:03:48.300> odd<00:03:48.510> numbers<00:03:48.900> in

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
and since there are no odd numbers in

and since there are no odd numbers in
synchronous<00:03:49.769> siteswap<00:03:50.250> there<00:03:50.849> are<00:03:51.030> no<00:03:51.209> ones
