that it's a stiff piece of nylon so that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I'm going to demonstrate that the floss

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
I'm going to demonstrate that the floss
threader<00:00:38.340> has<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> stiff<00:00:39.570> piece<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> nylon<00:00:40.230> at

threader has a stiff piece of nylon at
the<00:00:40.739> end<00:00:40.920> much<00:00:41.730> better<00:00:42.000> than<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> soft<00:00:42.840> floss

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the end much better than the soft floss
