00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.649
 hello I am Chinese of 15 and medical shows in this video I want to share with you 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:12.100
 monarchy the muralist would rather be in for purchases every time you go to 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:12.679
 to go 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.810
 hilda buy your cosmetic products I'm going to put them into practice is a 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.970
 list a drought that led that wanted to base on three fundamental principles 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.010
 that are very important to me 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.330
 the first are its ingredients the second its price 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.130
 and the third one that this product really meets 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 what it promises 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.260
 what bases because we are full of many lies that lived to know by 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 what do I say this then let's start with this list and here's the first 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.040
 there is something very important that many of us do not take into consideration and 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.500
 we give it the value it should have 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.200
 by law in the 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.430
 almost every country what exists 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.679
 I have been the labels of the products have to put the albert gums 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.320
 that can bring your well-being despite those customers using or in any other 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.360
 contraindication to the long term that you may have to use this product 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.310
 so take into account each of the warnings of the projects that are 

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:20.909
 being used if it's there is for a reason it's a decoration then 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.290
 consider this awareness report 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 listen i the very well the labels and everything to weave 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.030
 now well in crescent refers there is when things get 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.810
 they complicate a bit because unfortunately there are still many 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.479
 products with them with these toxic ingredients 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 and the task of choosing products in terms of preventing 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.270
 referred to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.030
 but there are also many companies that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.619
 I was being very smart 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.279
 are in the store or replacing these ingredients 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.010
 If they can touch us, I will pass before we will see the videos of responses to 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.740
 the challenges that suppose past that ingredient certain things then what 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.340
 what I have done is who the annotator of the ingredients that I have been taught 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.620
 that are important topic 10 and I've put them on a piece of paper and this 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.170
 little piece of paper with me, you do not have to wait like this when I go to 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.999
 the store what I do is take out my paper and also ingredients and I looked at the 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.510
 Northern Basque country tried to find another sony ericsson in English but just like 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.209
 way the vast majority of products that they see the market 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.680
 If the delay is believed to be good English then I do not think I'm going 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.530
 the same pÃ©rez difficulty for the people that is to say in other countries in 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.539
 Latin America that maybe not 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.319
 now I will not understand is to say is that it will mobilize account that for 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.379
 the list 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.379
 of the ingredients 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.620
 many of the things that we did not buy a fell sometimes we 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.829
 we are approaching we are buying from him because 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.269
 says these phrases as typical as for example 160 natural without percent 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.509
 organic osan the severity of joly wall of these people of it the chou despite 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.019
 that of the artistic medium 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.019
 and he says that the project is fantastic that they buy it blablabla 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.029
 these are advertising strategies that works why he exposes them that there 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.999
 People that are believed to be easily can be convinced 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.279
 simply to compose a celebrity with pretty with a very nice complexion with 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.739
 a very beautiful hair 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.079
 blablabla but many of them do not even use this product is more 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.199
 they are being attacked for doing this propaganda then it is not a 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.709
 It is not a real testimony nor fair because it is doing it has based 100% 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.449
 in a real testimony because they used the project but because they are 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.660
 paying from there that the laws changed here the United States especially the 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.960
 videos and castle 8 ica that a person talks about a product have the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.850
 obligation 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.880
 say if that person that is being paid for will send this product 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.080
 to talk of 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.650
 because there were many companies that fx stopped their sales because of this 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.189
 many times the product does not jump read what it says is to promise 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.640
 because it's been based simply on an advertising strategy so what 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.170
 alerts do not let us convince nor let us get entangled of things when 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.000
 go shopping see an open mind do not marry with a single line 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.650
 with only one product 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.430
 is doing unfair to yourself because because when a person is 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.379
 devote only used to say something na 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:20.629
 or to say something only chemistry creams or with auction the most 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:21.539
 economic 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.719
 for months the opportunity granted is being denied 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.389
 to meet other products of better quality 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.120
 to have better results and is more economical 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.360
 but also with which the participants prepare because 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.229
 because you are transcending the sales strategies is also to take 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.969
 products that are staying in the store that maybe I still very think that 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.580
 maybe they are not pending because they are not of good quality or simply not 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.080
 have liked in the market then one low with the conviction of buying their 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.500
 product I did arrive says we're going on product that we never met 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.409
 I met there many times those protests mine in the garbage 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.699
 so it's important if it's not like that but as 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.589
 with this suffering from there that can be 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.579
 percent and be for either side is to investigate stop with the 

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:18.169
 explanation that there is hope that a good shopping guide is not complete if 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.169
 there is no talk of prison not always expensive is the best and not always what 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.520
 economic 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.099
 by the way or not of very good quality that is a concept that does not always apply 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:35.509
 because there are many brands that simply is a brand jincheng produces its 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.199
 products a laboratory 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.990
 is the same lab can be creating the same product for back 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.590
 company of a cheaper brand the difference lies in the fact that this brand 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.370
 because it is more expensive and other renowned than the other that are not 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.259
 economic 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.559
 castÃ¡n much more money than him publicity 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:00.570
 in the product packaging that I think are the ones that spend the most paco 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.540
 serene the arbitration in which that fact 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.650
 smart shoppers those who save to be more everyday things 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.150
 then that is the list that 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.380
 the prelate for you I hope it is added in your note 

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.169
 I'm just taking a moment to take care of yourself
