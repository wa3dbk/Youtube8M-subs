00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.969
 Y 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.240
 I love the girl I never knew that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.580
 there was inside it was like something big 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.050
 crispy like that stuffing was part of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.900
 this like it was not important to me 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.500
 you can fill it with whatever you want to 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.419
 I really like to put a little bit of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.009
 pork mix those with a little 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.800
 Prawns has a wonderful flavor 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.800
 but today , delicious pork chops 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.990
 and some gloves 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.110
 I like it to look like a little pastita 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.340
 and it gets very little stuffed then 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.850
 here I have my chop meat also if 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.320
 they want to do it with chorizo ​​is rich 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.430
 they smell good nothing else has a little more 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.210
 of fat 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.210
 cinnamon 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.100
 yes yao 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 engine 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.600
 and in the end a little oil to your 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.600
 caliber that makes it so wetter 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.260
 let's do the opposite always 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.780
 try 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.080
 of not removing them from the bag until before 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.920
 to use because the mass that was falling and is 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.490
 as very difficult to put together to put a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.490
 little water 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.020
 We wanted to spend very little stuff that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020
 It's enough 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.430
 do not double here do not push because if not 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.570
 only the tip is going to split 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.470
 this they put it like this down and put together 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.470
 the two corners 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.509
 and that's it 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:07.359
 I can not make wantan is a false size 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.359
 it's too much we put vinegar 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.860
 some water 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 but not all 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.090
 they can do it a little more Peruvian and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.770
 put a slice of chili pepper that is 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.710
 spectacular but a little while more 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.930
 next is very spicy but of a flavor 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.350
 really rich not only boils and the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.350
 we think 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.830
 we put a few droplets of sealing 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.050
 final 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.800
 and let's see 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.800
 with Danish 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.200
 -sector 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.959
 and with what we left 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.260
 of water to put on seeing a bit of 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.260
 chun 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.060
 I do not like to set him apart a little more 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.239
 of water not being watered down 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.239
 always from the same recipe a little 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.400
