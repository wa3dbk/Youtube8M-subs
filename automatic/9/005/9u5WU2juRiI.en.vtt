00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.830 

that's<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.170> good<00:00:16.289> question<00:00:17.539> evidently<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
that's a good question evidently some of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.100 
that's a good question evidently some of
the<00:00:18.900> kinetics<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.330> aging<00:00:21.330> reactions<00:00:21.900> are

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
the kinetics of the aging reactions are

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.370 
the kinetics of the aging reactions are
dependent<00:00:22.650> upon<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.939> pH<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.869> higher<00:00:25.050> pH

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
dependent upon the pH and at higher pH

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529 
dependent upon the pH and at higher pH
that<00:00:25.650> lines<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.369> oxidize<00:00:26.669> and<00:00:27.119> fall<00:00:27.270> apart

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that lines will oxidize and fall apart

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.900 
that lines will oxidize and fall apart
faster<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.320> higher<00:00:28.919> acidity<00:00:29.189> wines<00:00:29.579> tend<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
faster so higher acidity wines tend to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.179 
faster so higher acidity wines tend to
have<00:00:30.029> lower<00:00:30.210> pH<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:30.960> tend<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:31.800> be

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
have lower pH and they tend to then be

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.990 
have lower pH and they tend to then be
preserved<00:00:32.610> better<00:00:33.800> if<00:00:34.800> we're<00:00:35.519> relying<00:00:35.790> upon

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
preserved better if we're relying upon

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670 
preserved better if we're relying upon
so2<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.839> point<00:00:37.050> particularly<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.650> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so2 at some point particularly with a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
so2 at some point particularly with a
white<00:00:37.920> wine<00:00:38.129> -<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.030> help<00:00:39.239> keep<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> wine<00:00:39.930> fresh

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
white wine - to help keep the wine fresh

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.320 
white wine - to help keep the wine fresh
over<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> long<00:00:40.890> period<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.220> time<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.610> so2<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
over a long period of time the so2 is

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.090 
over a long period of time the so2 is
more<00:00:42.570> effective<00:00:43.400> at<00:00:44.400> lower<00:00:44.760> pH<00:00:45.089> at<00:00:45.269> levels

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
more effective at lower pH at levels

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.109 
more effective at lower pH at levels
personally<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.159> just<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.400> that<00:00:47.729> wines<00:00:47.940> taste

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:48.119 
personally I just think that wines taste

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:50.450 
personally I just think that wines taste
better<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.659> lower<00:00:48.839> pH<00:00:49.199> and<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.339> get

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
better to the lower pH and as they get

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.329 
better to the lower pH and as they get
older<00:00:50.519> and<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:52.290> angles<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.799> the<00:00:52.860> wine<00:00:53.040> begin

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
older and the angles and the wine begin

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.140 
older and the angles and the wine begin
to<00:00:53.430> relax

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
to relax

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.530 
to relax
you<00:00:54.570> need<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.470> have<00:00:55.799> a<00:00:55.830> certain<00:00:56.400> amount<00:00:56.610> of

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
you need to have a certain amount of

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.840 
you need to have a certain amount of
angle<00:00:57.900> in<00:00:58.049> that<00:00:58.199> wine<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.799> to<00:00:59.040> taste<00:00:59.250> fresh<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
angle in that wine or to taste fresh and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.759 
angle in that wine or to taste fresh and
lively<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.689> your<00:01:00.809> mouth<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> acidity<00:01:01.650> is

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
lively in your mouth and the acidity is

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.390 
lively in your mouth and the acidity is
a<00:01:01.860> wonderful<00:01:02.250> thing<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.939> for<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:04.400> for

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
a wonderful thing to have for that for

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.270 
a wonderful thing to have for that for
those<00:01:05.489> two<00:01:05.760> reasons<00:01:05.790> both<00:01:06.360> perceived<00:01:07.280> for

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
those two reasons both perceived for

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.679 
those two reasons both perceived for
chemical<00:01:08.670> reasons<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.150> well<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.510> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
chemical reasons as well as just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.710 
chemical reasons as well as just
perceived<00:01:10.110> liveliness<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.479> matte<00:01:12.479> lip

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
perceived liveliness and matte lip

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
perceived liveliness and matte lip
smacking<00:01:13.200> goodness<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.770> think<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
smacking goodness I think to have a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.280 
smacking goodness I think to have a
reasonable<00:01:15.270> amount<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> acidity<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> very

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
reasonable amount of acidity is a very

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.950 
reasonable amount of acidity is a very
good<00:01:16.500> thing<00:01:17.180> Olivier<00:01:18.180> homewreck<00:01:18.600> talked

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
good thing Olivier homewreck talked

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.660 
good thing Olivier homewreck talked
about<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> importance<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> relation

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
about the importance of the relation

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.660 
about the importance of the relation
between<00:01:20.960> pH<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.230> acidity<00:01:22.620> and<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.190> taking

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
between pH and acidity and not taking

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.500 
between pH and acidity and not taking
just<00:01:23.970> acidity<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.780> pH<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:25.950> give<00:01:26.160> a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
just acidity or just pH can you give a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.500 
just acidity or just pH can you give a
chemistry<00:01:27.510> 101<00:01:27.900> view<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.190> pH<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
chemistry 101 view of what pH is and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.540 
chemistry 101 view of what pH is and
specifically<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.500> different<00:01:31.950> levels<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.250> pH

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
specifically what different levels of pH

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.210 
specifically what different levels of pH
do<00:01:32.909> -<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> wines<00:01:33.720> pH<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.680> easy<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.980> read

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
do - the wines pH is very easy to read

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.070 
do - the wines pH is very easy to read
into<00:01:35.400> wine<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.030> I'll<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.750> kind

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
into wine and I'll look at that is kind

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.140 
into wine and I'll look at that is kind
of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> brightness<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> wine<00:01:38.220> the

taken<00:02:08.470> organic<00:02:08.979> chemistry<00:02:09.429> it's<00:02:09.580> about<00:02:09.849> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
taken organic chemistry it's about the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.460 
taken organic chemistry it's about the
strength<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> acidity<00:02:10.810> given<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.290> same

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
strength of the acidity given the same

strength of the acidity given the same
acidity<00:02:12.130> level<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.580> lower<00:02:13.120> pH<00:02:13.420> wine<00:02:13.810> has<00:02:14.230> more

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
acidity level a lower pH wine has more

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.470 
acidity level a lower pH wine has more
activity<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:16.590> acidic<00:02:17.590> parts<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.120> seems

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
activity of the acidic parts so it seems

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.000 
activity of the acidic parts so it seems
that<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:19.989> more<00:02:20.200> apparent<00:02:20.560> right<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that it's more apparent right on the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.940 
that it's more apparent right on the
attack<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.670> look<00:02:22.120> at<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.480> speed<00:02:22.780> where<00:02:23.769> is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
attack I look at that as speed where is

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.040 
attack I look at that as speed where is
you<00:02:24.640> could<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:24.940> something<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.480> has<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> very

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
you could have something that has a very

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.960 
you could have something that has a very
high<00:02:26.110> pH<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.890> high<00:02:27.040> acidity<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.700> doesn't

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
high pH and a high acidity it doesn't

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.790 
high pH and a high acidity it doesn't
seem<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.209> bright<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.959> does<00:02:29.110> seem<00:02:29.410> kind<00:02:29.620> of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
seem as bright but it does seem kind of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.309 
seem as bright but it does seem kind of
sour<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:31.000> makes<00:02:31.239> any<00:02:31.420> sense<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:31.900> it's<00:02:32.140> so

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
sour that makes any sense but it's so

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.740 
sour that makes any sense but it's so
maybe<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.040> freshman<00:02:33.550> ish<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.269> could<00:02:34.540> look<00:02:34.630> at

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
maybe a freshman ish you could look at

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.830 
maybe a freshman ish you could look at
as<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> freshness<00:02:35.349> issue<00:02:36.000> lower<00:02:37.000> pH<00:02:37.390> would<00:02:37.569> seem

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
as a freshness issue lower pH would seem

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.490 
as a freshness issue lower pH would seem
fresher<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:39.069> then<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> wine<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.730> higher<00:02:39.910> pH

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
fresher and then a wine and a higher pH

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.020 
fresher and then a wine and a higher pH
but<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.739> confusing<00:02:42.099> because<00:02:42.549> they<00:02:42.670> are<00:02:42.819> so

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
but it is confusing because they are so

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.309 
but it is confusing because they are so
closely<00:02:43.239> related<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.140> different

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
closely related but it's different

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.470 
closely related but it's different
aspects<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:47.230> acidity<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.730> define<00:02:49.030> pH

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
aspects of of acidity can you define pH

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.559 
aspects of of acidity can you define pH
pH<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.739> negative<00:02:50.920> log<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.060> hydrogen

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
pH is the negative log of the hydrogen

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.819 
pH is the negative log of the hydrogen
ion<00:02:52.810> concentration<00:02:52.989> at<00:02:53.890> base<00:02:54.099> 10<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:56.709> you

ion concentration at base 10 can you

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.520 
ion concentration at base 10 can you
define<00:02:57.160> pH<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.980> define<00:03:00.310> pH<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.630> terms

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
define pH can you define pH in terms

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530 
define pH can you define pH in terms
that<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.310> government<00:03:03.579> major<00:03:03.849> would<00:03:04.120> understand

that a government major would understand

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.740 
that a government major would understand
um<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.590> might<00:03:05.739> be<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.430> number<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.970> the

um it might be the the number of the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.690 
um it might be the the number of the
relative<00:03:08.530> amount<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.799> free<00:03:09.010> hydrogen<00:03:09.310> ions

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
potential of that you know those

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.789 
potential of that you know those
hydrogen<00:03:13.390> ions<00:03:13.660> might<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.959> hanging<00:03:14.319> on<00:03:14.470> to

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
hydrogen ions might be hanging on to

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.580 
hydrogen ions might be hanging on to
stuff<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.390> may<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.959> see<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.200> quite<00:03:17.470> as

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
stuff and you may not see it quite as

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.620 
stuff and you may not see it quite as
much<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.010> that's<00:03:18.130> why<00:03:18.370> maybe<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.000> freshness

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
much and that's why maybe the freshness

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.830 
much and that's why maybe the freshness
would<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:20.280> my<00:03:21.280> idea<00:03:21.549> freshness<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.359> acidity

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
would be my idea freshness of acidity

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.449 
would be my idea freshness of acidity
would<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.290> there's<00:03:23.470> yeah<00:03:23.709> it's<00:03:23.920> easy<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
would be that there's yeah it's easy a

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.080 
would be that there's yeah it's easy a
lot<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.730> these<00:03:24.790> easy<00:03:26.370> reactive<00:03:27.370> hydrogen<00:03:27.850> ions

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
lot of these easy reactive hydrogen ions

lot of these easy reactive hydrogen ions
floating<00:03:28.299> around<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.840> does<00:03:28.959> seem<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.410> know

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
floating around so it does seem you know

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.319 
floating around so it does seem you know
really<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> lot<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.269> Verve<00:03:31.600> whereas<00:03:33.329> if

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
really have a lot of Verve whereas if

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.509 
really have a lot of Verve whereas if
more<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.079> those<00:03:35.170> hydrogen<00:03:35.620> ions<00:03:35.859> are<00:03:36.190> kind<00:03:36.489> of

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
more of those hydrogen ions are kind of

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.120 
more of those hydrogen ions are kind of

they<00:03:39.700> may<00:03:39.819> not<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.090> quite<00:03:40.359> as<00:03:40.600> readily

through there you could have the same
number<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.310> hydrogen<00:04:00.730> ions<00:04:01.000> but<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.870> amount

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
number of hydrogen ions but the amount

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.309 
number of hydrogen ions but the amount
of<00:04:02.319> them<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.620> are<00:04:02.739> free<00:04:03.010> in<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> given<00:04:04.290> pair<00:04:05.290> of

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
liquids it's going to seem different to

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.550 
liquids it's going to seem different to
you

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.960 
you
when

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
when

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.610 
when
taste<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.390> because<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.870> how<00:04:10.110> many<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.380> them<00:04:10.500> are

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
taste it because of how many of them are

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.760 
taste it because of how many of them are
free<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.850> could<00:04:12.150> test<00:04:12.480> chemically<00:04:13.380> for

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
free so you could test chemically for

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.569 
free so you could test chemically for
hydrogen<00:04:14.340> ions<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.850> pH<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:16.070> taste<00:04:17.070> very

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
hydrogen ions and pH and taste very

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.789 
hydrogen ions and pH and taste very
differently<00:04:18.150> from<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.600> actual<00:04:18.930> number<00:04:19.410> that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
differently from the actual number that

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.790 
differently from the actual number that
the<00:04:19.950> sheet<00:04:20.190> says<00:04:20.720> exactly<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.170> could<00:04:22.560> vary

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
the sheet says exactly so you could vary

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.050 
the sheet says exactly so you could vary
one<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.250> other<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.640> they<00:04:23.700> will<00:04:23.820> taste

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
one to the other and they will taste

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.690 
one to the other and they will taste
different<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:25.130> probably<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.220> lot<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
different to you probably a lot of the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.370 
different to you probably a lot of the
reason<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.300> difference<00:04:27.540> occurs<00:04:28.110> is

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
reason that that difference occurs is

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.750 
reason that that difference occurs is
either<00:04:28.530> just<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.040> amount<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.490> potassium

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
either just the amount of potassium

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.490 
either just the amount of potassium
that's<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.330> there<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.630> potassium<00:04:31.200> ions

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
that's in there and potassium ions

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.560 
that's in there and potassium ions
themselves<00:04:32.010> have<00:04:32.190> some<00:04:32.430> sort<00:04:32.730> of<00:04:32.850> taste<00:04:33.450> to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
themselves have some sort of taste to

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.070 
themselves have some sort of taste to
them<00:04:34.220> tending<00:04:35.220> toward<00:04:35.490> maybe<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:36.080> bitterness

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080
