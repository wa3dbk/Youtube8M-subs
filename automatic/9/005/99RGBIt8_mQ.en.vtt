 in reality it is not the case 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.530
 Today we want to show 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.530

 where do you see how in germany held 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.570
 the goal is that the animals 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.070
 be possible as quickly as possible 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.649

 completely finished 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 sincerely total weight so the 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.620
 statutory relatively old, the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.620
 to throw a battle 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.100
 what we here see it as authentic 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.490
 are broiled in Germany

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.010
 Germany bred and fattened 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.940

 to be kept
