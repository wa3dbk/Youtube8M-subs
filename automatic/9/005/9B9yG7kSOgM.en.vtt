today<00:00:03.320> I'm<00:00:03.529> going<00:00:03.709> to<00:00:03.800> show<00:00:04.010> you<00:00:04.040> how<00:00:04.430> to<00:00:04.460> do<00:00:04.850> a

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.090 
today I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.849 
today I'm going to show you how to do a
seed<00:00:05.390> stitch<00:00:05.809> pattern<00:00:06.349> and<00:00:06.439> it's<00:00:06.559> kind<00:00:06.800> of

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
seed stitch pattern and it's kind of

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.440 
seed stitch pattern and it's kind of
hard<00:00:07.130> to<00:00:07.220> see<00:00:07.760> the<00:00:08.510> pattern<00:00:08.960> itself<00:00:09.550> on<00:00:10.550> here

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
hard to see the pattern itself on here

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.810 
hard to see the pattern itself on here
but<00:00:11.690> it's<00:00:11.870> kind<00:00:11.960> of<00:00:12.200> a<00:00:12.320> cross<00:00:12.590> between<00:00:13.570> a

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
but it's kind of a cross between a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.329 
but it's kind of a cross between a
garter<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.240> rib<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:18.919> you<00:00:18.980> don't<00:00:19.189> have

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
garter and rib and so you don't have

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.509 
garter and rib and so you don't have
it's<00:00:19.970> not<00:00:20.210> quite<00:00:20.539> as<00:00:20.869> flexible<00:00:21.289> side<00:00:22.099> to<00:00:22.310> side

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
it's not quite as flexible side to side

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.169 
it's not quite as flexible side to side
as<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.419> rib<00:00:23.659> is<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:25.179> it's<00:00:26.179> not<00:00:26.449> as<00:00:26.599> uniform<00:00:27.019> as

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
as the rib is and it's not as uniform as

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.839 
as the rib is and it's not as uniform as
the<00:00:29.179> Garter<00:00:29.599> here's<00:00:29.899> the<00:00:30.079> Garter<00:00:30.550> next<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.729> the

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
the Garter here's the Garter next to the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.029 
the Garter here's the Garter next to the
seed<00:00:32.149> stitch<00:00:32.710> it's<00:00:34.329> kind<00:00:35.329> of<00:00:35.649> gives<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.769> a<00:00:36.859> nice

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
seed stitch it's kind of gives it a nice

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.029 
seed stitch it's kind of gives it a nice
texture<00:00:37.579> it's<00:00:37.820> really<00:00:38.059> good<00:00:38.269> for<00:00:38.739> wash<00:00:39.739> claws

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
texture it's really good for wash claws

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.750 
texture it's really good for wash claws
and<00:00:40.340> dish<00:00:40.519> claws<00:00:40.789> and<00:00:41.149> things<00:00:41.329> like<00:00:41.539> them

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
sometimes I have seen the seed stitch

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.770 
sometimes I have seen the seed stitch
like<00:00:46.010> I'm<00:00:46.219> gonna<00:00:46.370> demonstrate<00:00:46.609> also<00:00:47.420> called<00:00:47.690> a

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
like I'm gonna demonstrate also called a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
gonna use the nifty knitter long one and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.170 
gonna use the nifty knitter long one and
I<00:01:05.360> have<00:01:05.570> already<00:01:05.750> got<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.170> cast<00:01:06.440> on<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.310> for<00:01:08.150> a

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
I have already got the cast on and for a

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.320 
I have already got the cast on and for a
seed<00:01:08.900> stitch<00:01:09.380> you've<00:01:09.950> got<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:10.700> very<00:01:10.970> similar

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
seed stitch you've got it's very similar

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.640 
seed stitch you've got it's very similar
to<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.750> rib<00:01:12.080> but<00:01:14.020> you've<00:01:15.020> got<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.350> be<00:01:15.440> careful

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
to a rib but you've got to be careful

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.800 
to a rib but you've got to be careful
they<00:01:15.950> doesn't<00:01:16.190> turn<00:01:16.400> out<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.730> rib<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:17.720> you

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
they doesn't turn out like a rib so you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.340 
they doesn't turn out like a rib so you
will<00:01:18.110> knit<00:01:18.440> one<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.300> will<00:01:20.540> purl<00:01:20.930> one

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
will knit one and then you will purl one

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:32.140 
will knit one and then you will purl one
knit<00:01:26.800> one<00:01:27.800> so<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:30.130> like<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.370> rib<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
knit one so it is like the rib in the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.690 
knit one so it is like the rib in the
fact<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.020> knit<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.710> alternate<00:01:34.490> you

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
fact that you knit and you alternate you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.100 
fact that you knit and you alternate you
and<00:01:34.790> they<00:01:34.850> didn't<00:01:35.090> pull<00:01:35.270> stitches<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
and they didn't pull stitches on the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.080 
and they didn't pull stitches on the
same<00:01:36.350> row<00:01:36.640> your<00:01:37.640> difference<00:01:38.570> is<00:01:38.990> going<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.590> be

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
same row your difference is going to be

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.930 
same row your difference is going to be
your<00:01:41.800> rows<00:01:43.600> your<00:01:44.600> next<00:01:44.930> row<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:46.490> how<00:01:46.760> they

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
your rows your next row in how they

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.550 
your rows your next row in how they
stack<00:01:47.330> up<00:01:47.360> on<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:48.050> rib<00:01:48.970> stitch<00:01:49.970> your<00:01:50.690> knits<00:01:51.230> are

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
stack up on a rib stitch your knits are

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.620 
stack up on a rib stitch your knits are
on<00:01:51.800> top<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.250> knits<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:52.940> pearls<00:01:53.240> are<00:01:53.510> on

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
on top of knits and your pearls are on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.060 
on top of knits and your pearls are on
top<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:54.020> pearls<00:01:55.420> for<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.480> seed<00:01:56.930> stitch<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.490> will

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
top of pearls for a seed stitch you will

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.540 
top of pearls for a seed stitch you will
alternate<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.970> on<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.380> all<00:02:03.560> have<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:04.070> knit

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
alternate it so on you all have a knit

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.730 
alternate it so on you all have a knit
on<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.820> top<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.210> pearls<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.960> pearls<00:02:06.320> on<00:02:06.560> top

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
on the top of pearls and pearls on top

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.460 
on the top of pearls and pearls on top
of<00:02:06.920> knit<00:02:07.190> stitches<00:02:07.599> so<00:02:08.599> since<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:08.989> just<00:02:09.140> purl

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
of knit stitches so since we just purl

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.290 
of knit stitches so since we just purl
the<00:02:09.710> last<00:02:09.740> one<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:10.520> will<00:02:10.759> knit<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.630> our

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.170 

so<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.480> knit<00:02:15.900> our<00:02:16.260> pearls<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.580> then<00:02:17.819> we<00:02:17.970> will

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
so we knit our pearls and then we will

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.050 
so we knit our pearls and then we will
purl<00:02:18.959> our<00:02:19.319> knit<00:02:19.680> stitches<00:02:20.069> from<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.610> previous

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
purl our knit stitches from the previous

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.630 
purl our knit stitches from the previous
row<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.300> you're<00:02:24.480> doing<00:02:24.930> flat<00:02:25.319> panels<00:02:25.860> then

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
row so if you're doing flat panels then

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.580 
row so if you're doing flat panels then
it<00:02:27.060> would<00:02:27.239> be<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> same<00:02:27.810> each<00:02:28.110> row<00:02:28.349> would<00:02:28.530> be

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
it would be the same each row would be

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
it would be the same each row would be
the<00:02:28.800> same<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.489> knit<00:02:29.790> first<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.330> then

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
the same it would be knit first and then

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.260 
the same it would be knit first and then
purl<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.989> knit<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.410> purl<00:02:31.440> knit<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.160> purl

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
purl one knit and the purl knit and purl

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.790 
purl one knit and the purl knit and purl
going<00:02:33.270> both<00:02:33.450> directions<00:02:33.480> if<00:02:34.230> you're<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.560> in

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
going both directions if you're going in

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.699 
going both directions if you're going in
the<00:02:34.920> round<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.060> will<00:02:36.209> change<00:02:36.709> so

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
the round that then it will change so

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.930 
the round that then it will change so
that's<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.280> purl

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that's a purl

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:49.610 
that's a purl
so<00:02:39.269> we<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:40.019> knit<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:48.170> look<00:02:49.170> here<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.530> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
so we want to knit it look here in a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:03.130 
so we want to knit it look here in a
minute<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.220> distinguish<00:02:50.850> which<00:02:51.030> ones<00:02:51.330> which

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.650 

in<00:03:04.140> order<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.010> see<00:03:05.340> which<00:03:05.580> one's<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:06.000> switch<00:03:06.360> if

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
in order to see which one's a switch if

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.090 
in order to see which one's a switch if
you<00:03:06.810> flip<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.170> over<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.650> look<00:03:07.799> on<00:03:07.980> the

you flip it over and you look on the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.570 
you flip it over and you look on the
inside<00:03:08.450> then<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.900> see<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.980> knit

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
inside then you can see the knit

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.699 
inside then you can see the knit
stitches<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:14.239> horizontal<00:03:15.709> lines

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
stitches have the horizontal lines

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.150 
stitches have the horizontal lines
across<00:03:17.190> here<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:18.030> your<00:03:18.359> purl<00:03:18.780> stitches<00:03:19.290> will

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
across here in your purl stitches will

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.340 
across here in your purl stitches will
have<00:03:20.430> more<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> horseshoe

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
now we're back with just in Astro 2 we

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.770 
now we're back with just in Astro 2 we
will<00:03:45.390> start<00:03:45.840> Row<00:03:46.019> 3<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.160> hurled<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.570> one

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
will start Row 3 we just hurled that one

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.340 
will start Row 3 we just hurled that one
you<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.859> from<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.220> stitch<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.989> we<00:03:52.170> will

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
you can see from that stitch so we will

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.710 
you can see from that stitch so we will
need<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.850> course<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.359> said<00:03:54.390> if

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
need it and of course like I said if

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
need it and of course like I said if
you're<00:03:54.870> doing<00:03:55.200> flat<00:03:55.470> panels<00:03:55.980> then<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.850> would

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
you're doing flat panels then it would

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.190 
you're doing flat panels then it would
be<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.269> same<00:03:57.540> going<00:03:57.870> back<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.319> forth

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:20.789 

in<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.880> then<00:04:14.270> pearl

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:35.070 

and<00:04:21.430> then<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.120> then<00:04:34.360> going<00:04:34.690> back<00:04:34.720> it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
and then and and then going back it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.640 
and then and and then going back it
would<00:04:35.199> be<00:04:35.319> the<00:04:35.470> sign<00:04:35.710> move<00:04:35.919> it<00:04:36.099> knit<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.840> knit

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
would be the sign move it knit and knit

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.700 
would be the sign move it knit and knit
and<00:04:38.889> purl<00:04:38.979> you<00:04:39.849> just<00:04:40.090> need<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.419> make<00:04:40.569> sure<00:04:40.870> that

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.649 
and purl you just need to make sure that
you<00:04:42.460> alternate<00:04:44.069> from<00:04:45.069> the<00:04:45.490> previous<00:04:46.120> stitch

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
you alternate from the previous stitch

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.830

if you're looking at it vertically going

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.459 
if you're looking at it vertically going
up<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.289> down<00:04:50.759> something<00:04:51.759> that<00:04:51.909> one's<00:04:52.300> purl<00:04:52.900> so

up and down something that one's purl so

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.999 
up and down something that one's purl so

some<00:05:00.460> people<00:05:00.699> call<00:05:00.879> it<00:05:00.909> a<00:05:01.090> moss<00:05:01.330> stitch<00:05:01.919> when<00:05:02.919> I

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
some people call it a moss stitch when I

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.909 
some people call it a moss stitch when I
learned<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:06.750> for<00:05:07.750> me<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.199> moss<00:05:08.440> stitch<00:05:08.620> is

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
learned the for me the moss stitch is

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.709 
learned the for me the moss stitch is
slightly<00:05:09.430> different<00:05:09.909> but<00:05:10.090> some<00:05:10.330> people<00:05:10.599> will

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
slightly different but some people will

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.559 
slightly different but some people will
call<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.289> seed<00:05:11.560> stitch<00:05:11.889> or<00:05:12.069> moss<00:05:12.250> stitch<00:05:12.569> so

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
call a seed stitch or moss stitch so

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:22.700 
call a seed stitch or moss stitch so
it's<00:05:14.819> easy<00:05:15.819> to<00:05:15.940> get<00:05:16.150> confused<00:05:16.360> on<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:17.050> too

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.059 

now<00:05:23.710> that's<00:05:24.280> all<00:05:24.460> there<00:05:24.639> is<00:05:24.819> to<00:05:25.659> a<00:05:25.960> seed<00:05:26.740> stitch

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
now that's all there is to a seed stitch

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.180 
now that's all there is to a seed stitch
pattern<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.759> hope<00:05:28.090> this<00:05:28.300> helps<00:05:28.949> you<00:05:29.949> have<00:05:30.159> a
