00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
hair so that you can easily switch from

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.049 
hair so that you can easily switch from
a<00:00:48.059> center<00:00:48.660> part<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:49.800> side<00:00:50.070> part<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.850> still

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a center part to a side part and still

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.670 
a center part to a side part and still
haven't<00:00:51.390> looked<00:00:51.570> natural<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.530> my

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
haven't looked natural I like to have my

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.889 
haven't looked natural I like to have my
hair<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:52.950> braided<00:00:53.700> with<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> parts<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
hair actually braided with the parts the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
hair actually braided with the parts the
way<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> extensions

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
way I want it to be in extensions

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
way I want it to be in extensions
because<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> actual<00:00:57.600> skin

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because when you have the actual skin

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
because when you have the actual skin
under<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.469> closure<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.190> looks<00:00:59.370> more

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
under the closure then it looks more

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
under the closure then it looks more
natural<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> would<00:01:01.649> actually

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
natural so this way I would actually

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.249 
natural so this way I would actually
send<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> part<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:02.940> braids<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.050> have

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
send a part of my braids and they have

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.440 
send a part of my braids and they have
an<00:01:04.470> actual<00:01:04.710> side<00:01:05.039> part<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.270> going

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
an actual side part as well so I'm going

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.420 
an actual side part as well so I'm going
to<00:01:06.479> show<00:01:06.660> you<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.800> braiding<00:01:08.130> pattern

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to show you what my braiding pattern

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
to show you what my braiding pattern
looks<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.259> what<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.500> hair<00:01:13.649> looks

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
looks like so this is what my hair looks

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.389 
looks like so this is what my hair looks
like<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.580> braided<00:01:14.789> down<00:01:16.190> so<00:01:17.190> what<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
like when it's braided down so what I

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.940 
like when it's braided down so what I
did<00:01:17.520> typically<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.780> before<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.740> was

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
did typically because before when I was

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
did typically because before when I was
wearing<00:01:20.190> this<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> center<00:01:21.300> part<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
wearing this I'm just the center part I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
wearing this I'm just the center part I
just<00:01:21.930> saw<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:23.310> first<00:01:23.550> three<00:01:23.670> braids<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.569> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
just saw the first three braids here I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.330 
just saw the first three braids here I
void<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.229> away<00:01:25.440> from<00:01:25.649> each<00:01:25.740> other<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
void them away from each other so I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.370 
void them away from each other so I
would<00:01:26.550> have<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:27.000> flat<00:01:27.479> surface<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
would have a very flat surface in the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.199 
would have a very flat surface in the
middle<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.160> I<00:01:29.459> want<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.970> able<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
middle and now I want to be able to

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.350 
middle and now I want to be able to
switch<00:01:30.599> from<00:01:31.349> a<00:01:31.770> center<00:01:32.160> part<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> side<00:01:32.970> part

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
switch from a center part to a side part

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
switch from a center part to a side part
what<00:01:33.599> I<00:01:33.630> did<00:01:33.929> is<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.500> continue<00:01:35.459> to<00:01:35.670> braid<00:01:35.940> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
what I did is I continue to braid the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.249 
what I did is I continue to braid the
hair<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.590> side<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.810> braid<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
hair on the side this way if I braid the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.870 
hair on the side this way if I braid the
first<00:01:40.530> three<00:01:40.740> braids<00:01:41.069> this<00:01:41.399> way<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> then

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
first three braids this way and then

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
first three braids this way and then
because<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.209> to<00:01:45.300> be<00:01:45.390> able<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> side

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
because I want to be able to have a side

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.839 
because I want to be able to have a side
part<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.069> i<00:01:48.739> braid<00:01:49.739> from<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.580> point

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
part right there i braid from that point

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.680 
part right there i braid from that point
on<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.810> way<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:53.239> then<00:01:54.239> I<00:01:54.300> have<00:01:54.479> these

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
on down that way and then I have these

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.630 
on down that way and then I have these
two<00:01:54.750> braids<00:01:55.349> going<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> side<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.429> I<00:01:56.489> can

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
two braids going in the side so I can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.570 
two braids going in the side so I can
have<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.819> low<00:01:57.149> side<00:01:57.539> part<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.470> high<00:01:58.800> side<00:01:59.220> part

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
have a low side part or a high side part

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.380 
have a low side part or a high side part
or<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:00.869> center<00:02:01.170> part

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
or my center part

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
or my center part
so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.660> braid<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.430> firstly<00:02:05.430> braids

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
so I just braid that way firstly braids

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.960 
so I just braid that way firstly braids
that<00:02:05.910> braid<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:06.330> way<00:02:06.570> down<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.710> Bradys<00:02:08.670> all

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that braid this way down and Bradys all

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
that braid this way down and Bradys all
the<00:02:09.090> way<00:02:09.179> back<00:02:09.420> braid<00:02:10.410> him<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> side<00:02:11.009> like

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the way back braid him on the side like

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
the way back braid him on the side like
