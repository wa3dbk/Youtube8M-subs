 life where the blessing can not be seen 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.930

 the eyes the book 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.110

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.400
 they took my life until later 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.799
 your company handled the plot 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.799
 divided into two parts the north with both 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.640
 then the staff praise the praise 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.640
 do not 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.640
 s 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.090
 that's not just the theme 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.040
 how 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.510
 to know how 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.200
 let's express the psalmist 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.209
 to the same principle 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.550
 Sexual despair to the musician 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.140
 principal 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.140
 not the only 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.080
 and many of the natural people 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.319
 but I will be I regretted learning 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.760
 is restoring the canticle 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.760
 it's just to see it 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.020
 and when you have then 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.020
 when national restoration is brought 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.900
 your eyes like the temple 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.530
 they just have to be 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.000
 in an earthly ministry your eyes 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.000
 they have to be put in it 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.419
 his presence is the same 

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:37.860
 they discover many there are many who are 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:41.750
 sleeping there are many worshipers 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.750
 that the only thing that interests us is the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.750
 state 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.280
 it will be a way 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.650
 it does not work 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.990
 in this way it was not just a night 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.550
 full of praise of joy of emotion 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.500
 devotion to worship the king of kings and 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.150
 Lord of lords but it was a 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.850
 worship used by the spirit 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.580
 holy to call to reconcile with 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.830
 god to take that sword again 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.199
 victory and walk again to follow 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.389
 persevering to continue on the road 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.630
 obeying god and not cooling 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.750
 spiritually we need God all 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.360

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.340
