flow<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.060> fire<00:01:12.299> underneath<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:15.180> then

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
flow so the fire underneath can then

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
flow so the fire underneath can then
sort<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> start<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.750> inner<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:22.159> then

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
sort of start going the inner can then

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.440 
sort of start going the inner can then
heats<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.860> heats<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:28.369> hot<00:01:29.369> air<00:01:29.700> which

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
heats up as it heats up hot air which

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.090 
heats up as it heats up hot air which

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
gets warmed by the tin then flows into

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.789 
gets warmed by the tin then flows into
these<00:01:32.520> little<00:01:32.850> holes<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.650> alright<00:01:35.540> that

the<00:02:14.640> fire<00:02:14.849> from<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.599> gods<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.900> food<00:02:16.110> at

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
the fire from you know gods of food at

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.309 
the fire from you know gods of food at
first<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.030> then<00:02:18.030> lighting<00:02:18.810> from<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> top<00:02:19.290> and

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
first and then lighting from the top and

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.470 
first and then lighting from the top and
let<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.560> burn<00:02:19.769> down<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:21.060> reason<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> think

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
let it burn down the reason I think

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
let it burn down the reason I think
that's<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> myth<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.290> because<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:26.310> doesn't<00:02:26.610> make

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that's a myth is because it doesn't make

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
that's a myth is because it doesn't make
any<00:02:26.790> sense<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.260> I've<00:02:28.380> tried<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.069> didn't

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
any sense and I've tried it it didn't

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.860 
any sense and I've tried it it didn't
work<00:02:29.519> song<00:02:29.849> as<00:02:29.940> you've<00:02:30.030> got<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.269> fire<00:02:30.569> there

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
work song as you've got a fire there

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.330 
work song as you've got a fire there
which<00:02:30.989> eventually<00:02:31.230> burns<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.069> way

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
which eventually burns down a little way

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.370 
which eventually burns down a little way
so<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.910> gases<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.569> come<00:02:33.780> off<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> char

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
so that gases can come off the char

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.350 
so that gases can come off the char
namely<00:02:34.860> carbon<00:02:35.160> monoxide<00:02:35.610> mainly<00:02:36.000> which

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
namely carbon monoxide mainly which

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.850 
namely carbon monoxide mainly which
their<00:02:36.540> mixes<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.260> oxygen<00:02:37.739> creating

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
their mixes with more oxygen creating

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.740 
their mixes with more oxygen creating
carbon<00:02:38.250> dioxide<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.120> course<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> flame

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
carbon dioxide out of course the flame

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.920 
carbon dioxide out of course the flame
then<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.650> should<00:02:40.860> be<00:02:40.980> ok<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.540> I'm<00:02:42.690> going<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
then you should be ok so I'm going to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.070 
then you should be ok so I'm going to
try<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.170> again<00:02:43.700> probably<00:02:44.700> tomorrow<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.750> I've

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
try it again probably tomorrow and I've

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.470 
try it again probably tomorrow and I've
been<00:02:46.410> feeling<00:02:46.709> over<00:02:47.099> there<00:02:47.160> got<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.880> small<00:02:48.180> pile

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
been feeling over there got a small pile

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.199 
been feeling over there got a small pile
of<00:02:48.690> kindling<00:02:49.019> from<00:02:49.739> bits<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.160> broken<00:02:50.310> wood<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
of kindling from bits of broken wood and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.539 
of kindling from bits of broken wood and
I'm<00:02:51.599> going<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> play<00:02:52.019> about<00:02:52.140> with<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.340> there

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
I'm going to play about with it so there

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.720 
I'm going to play about with it so there
you<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.599> key<00:02:55.500> energy<00:02:55.680> revolution<00:02:56.130> made

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you go the key energy revolution made

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.839 
you go the key energy revolution made
from<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.890> turkish<00:02:58.890> coffee<00:02:59.160> tin<00:02:59.519> or<00:02:59.640> Greek

don't<00:03:07.049> use<00:03:07.260> them<00:03:07.440> indoors<00:03:07.590> because<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
don't use them indoors because the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.259 
don't use them indoors because the
carbon<00:03:08.489> monoxide<00:03:08.940> will<00:03:09.060> kill<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:11.269> and
