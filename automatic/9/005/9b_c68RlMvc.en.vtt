source<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.160> decomposition<00:03:12.500> mulching<00:03:13.500> is

source for decomposition mulching is

so<00:03:14.430> mulch<00:03:14.640> like<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.060> mean<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.569> grow

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
so mulch like you mean it and grow

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.410 
so mulch like you mean it and grow
organic<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.349> life
