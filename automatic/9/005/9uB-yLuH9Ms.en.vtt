with thumb screws so we've got two thumb
screws<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> back<00:02:08.789> holding<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.300> side

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
screws on the back holding this side

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.350 
screws on the back holding this side
panel<00:02:09.780> on

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
panel on

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.900 
panel on
so<00:02:10.900> here<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.320> top<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.790> see

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
so here we have the top and you can see

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610 
so here we have the top and you can see
that<00:02:13.060> there's<00:02:13.240> plenty<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.630> mesh<00:02:14.230> ventilation

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that there's plenty of mesh ventilation

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.820 
that there's plenty of mesh ventilation
up<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.250> we<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.240> spots<00:02:16.570> here<00:02:16.840> for<00:02:17.140> mounting

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
up here we have spots here for mounting

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.030 
up here we have spots here for mounting

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.920 
two fans 120 millimeters or 140
millimeters<00:02:21.460> again<00:02:22.060> they've<00:02:22.390> included<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
millimeters again they've included the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.510 
millimeters again they've included the
rubber<00:02:23.110> grommets<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.680> help<00:02:24.010> reduce<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
rubber grommets to help reduce the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.410 
rubber grommets to help reduce the
vibration<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.320> keep<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.500> noise<00:02:26.650> down<00:02:27.420> there

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
vibration and keep the noise down there

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.810 
vibration and keep the noise down there
is<00:02:29.080> not<00:02:29.320> really<00:02:29.590> enough<00:02:30.010> room<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.370> put<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
is not really enough room to put a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.050 
is not really enough room to put a
radiator<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.510> here<00:02:31.840> though<00:02:32.770> with<00:02:33.610> some

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
radiator in here though with some

modification<00:02:34.810> maybe<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.200> can<00:02:35.380> get<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> to

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
modification maybe you can get it to

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.060 
modification maybe you can get it to
work<00:02:37.080> here<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> bottom<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> case
