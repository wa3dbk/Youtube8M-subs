00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.469
 Hello and welcome to Berlin 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 Wood is the wiki and I am in today 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.250
 The caroline passages visit the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.170
 singer mio turning a milk today 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 Here is your video no, that's the second one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.859
 video now what is the song still called 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 That's why levi net is called from now on 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 I just kidnapped you from the mask 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.760
 here's another clip what you 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.210
 Today I wear what I wear today 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.070
 wear so that I it is fast strong 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 after musical from what we are here with 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.160
 Handsawing when listening to musical dancers 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 in fact they are curious 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 that's why it looks like a musical 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 and I have a fifties dress like this 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.510
 a bit sailor moderate to what but pink 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.489
 is and then you have also bright pumps 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 with his big heart so big 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.250
 on top of it on the toe and he is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.289
 very playful and colorful and cheerful 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 look and mio is also from hamburg 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 it works really well 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.030
 it was already in new york how did it happen 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.560
 So what did you experience there so for the first time 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 New York is a great city at all 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.220
 Worth to visit but I had 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.049
 always the dream lama to travel 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.430
 I wanted to do it alone too 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.560
 then after my education or advertising 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.509
 then my money scraped together one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 then flown over and thought if 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.869
 I'm going I have to actually 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.150
 sing and then saw a club 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.369
 where so many songwriters and artists like that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.080
 had their beginnings 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.430
 and that somehow made me so happy 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.509
 made and the moment that I thought 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 Now I try that with the music 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 really serious and pushes that still 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.530
 More and content from New York again 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 came and it was clear that I was 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.500
 want to do 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.369
 how did it in New York as your 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.509
 perception for fashion influences 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.399
 I also saw that all 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.110
 is allowed that I found totally cool 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.670
 So the people are really there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 like a colorful bird and interested in it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.240
 no sock so in the sense of you can 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.110
 do what you want and it's cool 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.409
 how you live like that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.320
 and then when you look at the designer 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.729
 hamburg is on the way and then you fall 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.070
 sometimes just stop when 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.530
 Not so necessarily in khaki shirt 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.390
 running around and in new york is always everything 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.590
 colorful that was pretty cool me 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510
 have me stop taken from that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680
 you do everything there 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.970
 and it's cool and that you look 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.650
 just a little more daring 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.049
 who the world is also something individual 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.959
 and general your music is very much 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.760
 soulful what do you take for the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.590
 fashion out lets you styling yourself 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.890
 technically somehow influence or 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.930
 So I believe what I do 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.760
 most of them are fifties and so on 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.950
 sixties things and they are yes 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.379
 actually rather with rockabilly 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.209
 verbund has turned out to be with seoul 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.640
 but I try to mix it like that 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.540
 this sixties soul from America what you 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.819
 your own style 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.239
 yes, I make such a conglomerate 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.099
 In any case, how do you have yourself? 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.900
 heard in the radio and will be 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.280
 But that was great for everyone 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.829
 So we had that a few times 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.450
 that we live more like that 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.510
 or so at energy for example 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.459
 and from few days it was so in there 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.750
 This rotation planning to limit up everything like that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.849
 we ran short over and over 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.310
 Stop being frustrated to everyone 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.900
 were and it was 48 hours before 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.239
 Start shooting and then I learned 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.699
 that evening takes place at ndr 2 radio 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.040
 ran and that has all flashed us so 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.209
 that was so little happy tears element 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.410
 where we thought that's it 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.419
 sign that you can not continue 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.000
 must and that makes an extremely happy 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.900
 because you have the feeling that the people 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.669
 maybe a bit 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 get to know you already stood with 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.239
 Chris of Revolverheld on the stage 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.949
 what will you already have? 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.629
 met and will do that for you 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.480
 There are some funny ones 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.489
 stories you can tell us 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.410
 So chris is thus among the coolest 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.480
 with whom I have done something up to now 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.440
 Anyway, what a nice thing because we 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.730
 from 10 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.859
 march at hamburg sounds with heino 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.160
 played it was a very strange 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.329
 mix what's up there 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.680
 but usually that is 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.299
 also a normal musician and 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.230
 people as we all believe, too 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.639
 then we'll take a look again 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.440
 a little bit behind the scenes and 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.540
 watch you and feel natural 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.879
 also your outfit and then we wish 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.319
 Have fun with the video and 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:12.519
 Thank you for stopping us here now 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.519

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.090

 But a date is okay then note it 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:56.680
