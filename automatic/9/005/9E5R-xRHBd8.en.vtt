00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.700
 to make this little kimono slipper 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.710
 so I'm doing them in size 18 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.089
 in fact it's very simple to achieve 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.530
 very comfortable it also serves to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.330
 babies as adults 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.750
 so in fact we're going to start with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.390
 to do the week so for that I have 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.300
 used on the side because that's more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 held and with needles number three 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 in fact we're going to t16 my so when 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 we climbed our 16 miles we 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.710
 let's knit each round to the point 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.400
 so foam up to the desired length 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.680
 so in fact it's according to the bottom of the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.680
 foot of your baby 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.830
 the foam point is all in the place 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.170
 when we got the length of the 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.180
 desired week we will ride the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.039
 name a mesh number actually on the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 same needle that will match the 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.960
 length of the week 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.079
 so me for the measures I took 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.729
 I need 28 my I change colors 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.700
 you can do them in one color 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.380
 but I find it more fun 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 two-color so I'm going to mount my 28 my 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:45.799
 on the same needle we find the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:51.450
 week so here we will continue 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:56.750
 at the point in garter st and goes up 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.750
 then 28 mesh at the other end 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.320
 so at the end of your rank we go back 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.320
 28 my so like this 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.990
 when we mounted our side of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.290
 dubai 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:39.510
 so we will continue to the point of 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.720
 mons all to the place so in fact he's going 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.950
 we need to get the same 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.950
 width as the width of the week 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:02.030
 so when we reach the height of the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.030
 week so to measures like these 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.590
 so counting on making a color 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.700
 different 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.610
 so we're going to end up with oran's 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.260
 black color always at the front 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.260
 must cut down all the stitches 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.459
 so once we have the width 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.900
 of the sole obtained we are left 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.900
 more than folding enamel 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.660
 class 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.500
 so here is once completed what we 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.210
 must obtain 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.280
 all that remains is to do 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:04.570
 different seams so in fact we're going 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.660
 start on the wrong side so while 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.920
 leaving the week we will dress 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:18.430
 fold a first band what we 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.230
 let's sew so when we've done 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.310
 the first seam we will proceed 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:30.670
 at the second seam so we place 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:34.780
 the second sewing tape at the level of 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.990
 the week so here's what you need 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:43.110
 get it left more in fact than in 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.110
 fold each band on the week 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.940
 will listen to the last 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.030
 here it is finished so once sewn 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.070
 where you put them back to the place and 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.010
 that's what you need to get so 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.020
 very comfortable for very babies 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.330
 easy to put on is very easy to do 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.680
 in fact it takes about half a 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.180
 time to perform a show are so in 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.870
 does what is what is not evil is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.970
 to cross the last stitch so 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.790
 actually trying to make a right foot 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.790
 a left foot by reversing the seam
