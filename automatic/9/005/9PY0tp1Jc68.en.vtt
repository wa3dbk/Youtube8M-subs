00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
chamber is pretty pretty small and if

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.040 
chamber is pretty pretty small and if
you<00:01:10.860> compare<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.850> jumbo<00:01:13.100> size

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
you compare it to this jumbo size

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.320 
you compare it to this jumbo size
chamber<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.310> tell<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
chamber you can tell that this is is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.770 
chamber you can tell that this is is
pretty<00:01:18.900> small<00:01:19.729> one<00:01:20.729> thing<00:01:20.940> though<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
pretty small one thing though about it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
pretty small one thing though about it
is<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.970> has<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.479> piercing<00:01:25.260> dots<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is that it has these piercing dots that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.469 
is that it has these piercing dots that
go<00:01:26.810> through<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.159> actually<00:01:31.190> get<00:01:32.190> flush<00:01:32.549> even

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
go through and actually get flush even

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.500 
go through and actually get flush even
more<00:01:33.780> than<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.260> surface<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.210> really

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
more than the surface so this really

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.810 
more than the surface so this really
truly<00:01:36.900> squeezes<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> pierces<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
truly squeezes out and pierces the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
truly squeezes out and pierces the
garlic<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.170> winning<00:01:43.170> point

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
garlic this could be the winning point

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.789 
garlic this could be the winning point
so<00:01:44.310> let<00:01:44.430> me<00:01:44.520> grab<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> few<00:01:45.240> garlic<00:01:45.570> cloves<00:01:45.990> and

by<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:50.130> even<00:01:50.580> though<00:01:50.790> even<00:01:51.570> though<00:01:51.780> we

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
by the way even though even though we

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
by the way even though even though we

can crush these garlic's with the peel

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.160

through<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.620> really<00:02:49.100> cleans<00:02:49.520> easily<00:02:49.790> I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
through and it really cleans easily I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.860 
through and it really cleans easily I
was<00:02:50.930> very<00:02:51.230> surprised<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.920> see<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.310> Amazon<00:02:52.970> that

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
you can see that it's almost completely

clean you just have to rinse it let me
do<00:03:20.060> another<00:03:20.270> one<00:03:20.480> just<00:03:20.510> for<00:03:20.720> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
do another one just for the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.010 
do another one just for the
demonstration<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:22.310> got<00:03:22.460> actually<00:03:22.960> kind<00:03:23.960> of

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
demonstration it's got actually kind of

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.610 
demonstration it's got actually kind of
fun

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.920 

so<00:03:30.550> let<00:03:30.670> me<00:03:30.730> talk<00:03:30.879> about<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.209> minuses<00:03:31.629> why<00:03:31.870> do

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
so let me talk about the minuses why do

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.720 
so let me talk about the minuses why do
I<00:03:32.080> think<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.530> minuses<00:03:32.950> are<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
I think the minuses are I think the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.250 
I think the minuses are I think the
Andals<00:03:34.120> are<00:03:34.300> a<00:03:34.330> little<00:03:34.690> too<00:03:34.870> short

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
Andals are a little too short

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.660 
Andals are a little too short
I<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.940> rubberized<00:03:37.239> area<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.670> really

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
I think the rubberized area is really

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.339 
I think the rubberized area is really
not<00:03:40.920> not<00:03:41.920> adding<00:03:42.400> anything<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:43.090> wish<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.200> the

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
not not adding anything I wish that the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.770 
not not adding anything I wish that the
plot<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.860> rubber<00:03:45.190> part<00:03:45.580> was<00:03:45.910> one<00:03:46.180> piece<00:03:46.450> it's

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
plot that rubber part was one piece it's

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.130 
plot that rubber part was one piece it's
two<00:03:47.019> pieces<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.650> could<00:03:48.129> be<00:03:48.310> gunk<00:03:49.140> getting

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
two pieces that could be gunk getting

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.020 
two pieces that could be gunk getting
into<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.790> two<00:03:51.790> parts<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:53.470> find<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.160> it's

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
into this two parts and I find that it's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.240 
into this two parts and I find that it's
just<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.569> little<00:03:55.690> too<00:03:55.989> short<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.530> when<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.860> do

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
just a little too short so when you do

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.150 
just a little too short so when you do
press<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:58.080> this<00:03:59.549> this<00:04:00.549> area<00:04:00.819> fluxes<00:04:02.130> yeah<00:04:03.130> I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
press it this this area fluxes yeah I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.420 
press it this this area fluxes yeah I
don't<00:04:03.610> know<00:04:03.959> something<00:04:04.959> about<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.319> flexes<00:04:05.860> and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
don't know something about it flexes and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.289 
don't know something about it flexes and
feels<00:04:07.269> just<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.720> bit<00:04:08.260> weird<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:09.670> other<00:04:10.030> than

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
feels just a bit weird but other than

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.089 
feels just a bit weird but other than
that<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.720> really<00:04:10.810> think<00:04:11.349> it's<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.590> good<00:04:11.739> garlic

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
that I really think it's a good garlic

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.369 
that I really think it's a good garlic
presser<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.730> know<00:04:12.819> what<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.540> think<00:04:14.049> this

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
presser you know what I I think this

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.280 
presser you know what I I think this
will<00:04:14.620> last<00:04:15.250> for<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:16.600> quite<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.810> while

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
will last for for quite a while

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.250 
will last for for quite a while
see<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.829> one<00:04:18.040> for<00:04:18.250> example<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.019> good

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
see this one for example not a good

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.120 
see this one for example not a good
garlic<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.570> that's<00:04:22.750> why<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.930> recommend<00:04:23.169> even

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
garlic so that's why I recommend even

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.700 
garlic so that's why I recommend even
though<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.310> can<00:04:24.580> press<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.300> with<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.720> with

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
though you can press it with the with
