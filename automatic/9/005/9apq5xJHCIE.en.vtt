00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I greet the viewers of my channel 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.170
 looked at the video of his colleague the other day 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.500
 Andrew Fair Witch and decided to make a video 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.010
 the answer today will tell about the filler 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.330
 pattern 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.930
 who has been using the workshop for a couple of years 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.230
 let's say i need one detail 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.680
 set the second by choosing a groove for this 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.970
 in order not to do a lot of calculations 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 markup do not do trial milling a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.870
 so that one has to be profiled once 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.290
 and immediately installed for this i use 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 Here is such an adjustable filler 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:51.710
 the template is made very simple 2 plan of 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.710
 grooves two pieces of fiberboard and two pieces of chipboard 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.129
 when I put this design together 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 dvp was a few millimeters more 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.559
 then I installed the router on one 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.869
 half and drill this edge and on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.040
 the second half of the distance from the tooth cutter 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 to the edge of the platform I have here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.409
 this distance 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 but since I have different here 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 distances from different sides then on the pattern 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 there is a direction arrow and now I donâ€™t 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.750
 need to calculate the width 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:36.049
 Well , I put the mating part 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.049
 I tighten the screws 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.720
 and set the template to the place where I 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.320
 I will mill here for example 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:02:05.759
 this line here now I compress all 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:08.450
 clamps design and start 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.450
 to mill 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:27.820
 and so I did it for me 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:35.590
 it turned out almost perfect 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:40.740
 mate link on edge was good 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:45.280
 can be seen without a gap at what in one pass 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.340
 Now a disadvantage of this design is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.450
 my first template and when I did it 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.800
 I teach one moment if the frezer changes 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.640
 either the milling cutter changes 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.990
 then here it is the distance will be different 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.300
 so this pattern can be used 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.220
 only with one frezer and with one 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.040
 cutter diameter 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.180
 therefore, in the next embodiment, these 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.950
 lining of hardboard 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.830
 i did so they fasten to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.650
 guides on the screws I have 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.970
 ability to shift them 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.130
 flip over or replace 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.320
 to others depending on which 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.080
 mill and what mill i use in 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.560
 this moment if I'm interested 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.640
 I'll take a video and about that template but a little 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.380
 later because now i have 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.290
 several other topics I want 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.930
 remove the first turn 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.770
 Well, perhaps on this for today all all 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.620
 thanks who is on my channel who 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:50.470

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.250
 everyone who likes and see you in 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.790
 next video 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.790
 bye everyone
