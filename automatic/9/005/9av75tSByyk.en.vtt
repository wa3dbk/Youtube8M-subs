00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
infrastructure so do you wait for the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
infrastructure so do you wait for the
infrastructure<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.500> built<00:01:37.679> or<00:01:38.190> do<00:01:38.399> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270 
now is to find the technology we have
and<00:02:03.840> start<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.200> reducing<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> cost<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.040> here's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and start to reducing the cost so here's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.429 
and start to reducing the cost so here's
a<00:02:05.310> case<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.700> taking<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.689> precious<00:02:07.020> metals

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
a case of taking out the precious metals

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.960 
a case of taking out the precious metals

we feel so the world is waking up to the

we take our hat off to hide I who've
