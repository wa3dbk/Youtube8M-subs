00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 and quite hard very slippery that 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.440
 this conditioned a bit of the afternoon its 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.970
 auto but good to be here has won by 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.610
 at least the manga I think it was 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.500
 distracted because I wanted to see the times 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 that he was not very happy with the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
 development that had him beyond 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.039
 of having beaten national to you already 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.500
 they are preparing nothing more and nothing less 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.300
 the leaders of the championship 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 multiple world champion sebastian les 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.880
 so much being solberg there are the man 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 from citroën the man from fort pablo what 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.950
 we have nasser had a career 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.680
 Not difficult 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.980
 if it got complicated he went outside to see what 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 He says 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.130
 In the south 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.110
 I'm going to ask you to go wyk in defeat 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:00.450
 fear of talking and annoying 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.450
 and attacked nephritic carihuela 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.649
 argentina chile but where there is now there 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.649
 more songs from here in haiti 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.060
 you come to me more flight 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.290
 now he's caught Pablo good 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 talking at the end of the possibility of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 return to dakar next year by 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.860
 toyota that for a news that I 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.080
 commented that for now we have to keep 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 the reservation there is one more chance for the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 Qatari pilot and on the other hand 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.680
 special since he made a big trunk 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.750
 that he was able to return to the route and good 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 just the race is going to start tomorrow 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.009
 with that the pilot of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.990
 Qatar about what has happened with 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.490
 your mistake here we are already seeing the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.049
 action to the two men that I believe 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.560
 will be the main protagonists of the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 career 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.780
 I will follow you Senators Cordoba for the 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.440
 seventh pere bosch by the side 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.420
 the change 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.270
 inside goes to petter solberg with the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.650
 movistar like that comes 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.010
 a career stretch that seems much more 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.459
 and between the slipperiness jumped luís 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.650
 surpass the pilots 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.810
 they take risks as we have already seen 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.810
 and in a city ​​of the day said outside 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.580
 almost 180 degrees per couple of tenths 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.290
 the multiple champion 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.680
 teaching 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.340
 to see one of the most charismatic one 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.690
 of the men who has harvested 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.480
 fans all over the world 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.650
 many years ago they do not go to seven 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.190
 last victory was in portugal 2005 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.500
 may the Argentine cut that spell 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.500
 we will see how solvent is second 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.870
 and it's going to be the number one flower in the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 2012 season but giving nine of 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.890
 them and matti latvala and over the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.560
 absence of the Finnish driver in our 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:28.110
 country are practically giving him the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.180
 credit so that peter happens to command 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.120
 we really want what the decision is 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.460
 finally from the directors 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.590
 mainly from malcolm wilson 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.900
 the speed of xian and martín but 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.900
 he also knows that the Finn is very 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.560
 prone to mistakes peter 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.750
 since it's a year 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.000
 wants to score points for the team knows 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.610
 that is the goal but why not 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.470
 Try again to enjoy the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.470
 honeys of triumph something that is denied 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.900
 systematically rally after rally 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.770
 and also fulfilling in this opportunity 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.270
 170 races started 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.270
 the Norwegian also to his story 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.050
 the world of 2003 with subaru in that 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:20.350
 moment now here in Argentina with 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:24.090
 a walk but yes but also the one of 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.090
 on land the passage of attractions 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.060
 butler to absolve we will see who is 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.060
 imposes 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.030
 this is starting the rally of the 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.540
 Argentine republic thirty-second 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.969
 edition 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.810
 I jump from far 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:46.500
 on the flight 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.070
 you are arriving the French pilot 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.070
 Under the bridge 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.680
 and is fulfilling 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.440
 the turn is now crossed track 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.909
 sideways controlled 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.909
 on behalf of skids 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.750
 that a week ago also in my city 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.520
 rave a lot of people in the city ​​of 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.819
 buenos aires in the road show that 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.819
 organized the French brand at the foot 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.390
 but alcorta 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.430
 you do not see it in actions 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.190
 Petter Solberg 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.700
 confident in its possibilities confident 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.700
 for a car that is evolving 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.680
 2012 showing that it is at the level of 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.090
 citroën team and the people who scream and 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.440
 delirious jump did not spare anything about 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.800
 decided to end everything 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.800
 the four wheels in the air and meat 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.800
 after 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.120
 to see that it showed to be faster than seeing 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.760
 in the difference is that according to the 10 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.120
 seconds 2 tremendous what about solberg about 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.960
 Sebastian to give a good start to his career 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.460

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.139
 and we are waiting for him here pablo 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.539
 meanwhile the tail is ready 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.630
 so that the pilots continue running 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.430
 of production here comes the auto solver 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.870
 superable is not in information 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.490
 We are 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.490
 yes yes sections
