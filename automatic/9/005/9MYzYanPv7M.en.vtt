00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
bowl is when the first three but lose

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.069 
bowl is when the first three but lose
the<00:03:47.730> next<00:03:47.909> four<00:03:48.209> three<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:50.340> was

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
the next four three so that was

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.390 
the next four three so that was
anybody's<00:03:52.079> game<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.590> puts<00:03:52.799> them<00:03:52.889> on<00:03:53.069> kind<00:03:53.340> of

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
anybody's game and puts them on kind of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.910 
anybody's game and puts them on kind of
a<00:03:53.489> level<00:03:53.790> playing<00:03:54.030> surface<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.379> match

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
a level playing surface and that match

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.610 
a level playing surface and that match
play<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.670> pretty<00:03:57.030> difficult<00:03:57.299> it's<00:03:58.049> also<00:03:58.290> i

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
play is pretty difficult it's also i

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.410 
play is pretty difficult it's also i
think<00:03:58.859> this<00:03:59.010> total<00:03:59.670> pens<00:03:59.909> it's<00:04:00.150> almost<00:04:00.269> like

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
think this total pens it's almost like

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.750 
think this total pens it's almost like
the<00:04:00.540> electoral<00:04:00.989> college<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:02.250> can<00:04:02.459> win<00:04:02.639> the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the electoral college you can win the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.729 
the electoral college you can win the
total<00:04:03.090> pins<00:04:03.299> but<00:04:03.540> lose<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.079> match<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.530> what

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
total pins but lose the match and what

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.979 
total pins but lose the match and what
ACM<00:04:05.250> rice<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.760> might<00:04:05.909> have<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.090> game<00:04:06.329> where<00:04:06.599> you

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
ACM rice you might have a game where you

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.740 
ACM rice you might have a game where you
win<00:04:07.319> by<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.920> long<00:04:08.670> shot<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:08.969> you<00:04:09.239> know<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.450> know

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
win by a long shot but you know you know

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.179 
win by a long shot but you know you know
when<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.109> four<00:04:10.319> games<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> other<00:04:10.739> day<00:04:10.950> i<00:04:10.980> did

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
when you four games the other day i did

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.709 
when you four games the other day i did
so<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.430> could<00:04:11.639> have<00:04:11.730> total<00:04:12.180> depends<00:04:12.389> better

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
so you could have total depends better

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.809 
so you could have total depends better
than<00:04:13.260> people<00:04:13.409> qualified<00:04:13.980> earlier<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.519> total

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
than people qualified earlier on total

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.159 
than people qualified earlier on total
pins<00:04:14.999> but<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.359> match<00:04:15.629> play<00:04:15.659> they<00:04:15.959> don't

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
pins but now the match play they don't

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.009 
pins but now the match play they don't
so<00:04:16.459> i<00:04:17.459> think<00:04:18.000> electoral<00:04:18.479> college<00:04:18.780> win<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
so i think electoral college win a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.879 
so i think electoral college win a
proper<00:04:19.489> collections<00:04:20.489> right<00:04:21.590> like<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.740> just

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
proper collections right like we just

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:23.719 
proper collections right like we just
say<00:04:23.009> before<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.580> be<00:04:23.639> two

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
say before it's going to be two

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.159 
say before it's going to be two
different<00:04:23.820> oil<00:04:24.150> patterns<00:04:24.570> which<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.930> going<00:04:25.110> to

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
different oil patterns which is going to

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.029 
different oil patterns which is going to
be<00:04:25.289> very<00:04:26.930> interesting<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.020> watch<00:04:28.169> because<00:04:28.470> one

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
be very interesting to watch because one

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.339 
be very interesting to watch because one
pattern<00:04:29.310> may<00:04:29.639> look<00:04:29.820> less<00:04:30.120> than<00:04:30.479> any<00:04:30.750> other<00:04:30.960> if

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
pattern may look less than any other if

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.100 
pattern may look less than any other if
the<00:04:31.650> bowl<00:04:32.099> is<00:04:32.280> full<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.880> same<00:04:33.060> speed<00:04:33.389> on

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
the bowl is full of the same speed on

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.930 
the bowl is full of the same speed on
both<00:04:34.320> lanes<00:04:34.590> one<00:04:35.370> ball<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.669> going<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.820> be

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
both lanes one ball is going to be

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.249 
both lanes one ball is going to be
completely<00:04:36.300> different<00:04:36.720> than<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.900> other<00:04:37.050> one

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
completely different than the other one

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.510 
completely different than the other one
so<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.530> reaction<00:04:38.009> is<00:04:38.099> going<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> be<00:04:38.310> totally

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
so the reaction is going to be totally

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.180 
so the reaction is going to be totally
different<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.570> really<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.199> puts<00:04:40.590> all

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
different so it really just puts all

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.890 
different so it really just puts all
these<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.580> inane<00:04:41.940> jables<00:04:42.300> involved<00:04:42.780> with

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
these little inane jables involved with

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.560 
these little inane jables involved with
a<00:04:42.960> game<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.470> technology<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.570> playing

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
a game the technology the playing

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.749 
a game the technology the playing
surface<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.470> that's<00:04:46.650> what<00:04:46.830> all<00:04:47.610> the

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
surface and that's what all the

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.640 
surface and that's what all the
commentators<00:04:48.210> talk<00:04:48.539> about<00:04:48.750> all<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.960> time<00:04:49.139> and

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
commentators talk about all the time and

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.409 
commentators talk about all the time and
you<00:04:49.740> learn<00:04:50.130> all<00:04:50.159> this<00:04:50.310> well<00:04:50.820> by<00:04:50.940> watching<00:04:51.180> all

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
you learn all this well by watching all

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.010 
you learn all this well by watching all
the<00:04:51.539> time<00:04:52.340> but<00:04:53.659> they're<00:04:54.659> really<00:04:54.810> looking

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
the time but they're really looking

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.719 
the time but they're really looking
forward<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.919> like<00:04:56.130> i<00:04:56.159> say<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.460> will<00:04:56.580> go
