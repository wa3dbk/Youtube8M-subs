everything centered and
headphones<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> put<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.700> stereo

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
headphones if you put it on stereo

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.839 
headphones if you put it on stereo
you'll<00:02:15.540> hear<00:02:15.930> your<00:02:16.200> instrument<00:02:16.800> or<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.250> mp3

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
other side so it probably would be

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
other side so it probably would be
better<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.220> put<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.550> mono<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.239> won't<00:02:24.390> be

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
better to put it on mono so it won't be

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.410 
better to put it on mono so it won't be
