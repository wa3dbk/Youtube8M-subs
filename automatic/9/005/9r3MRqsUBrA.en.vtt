00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
guys do but these j's here are jets and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470 
guys do but these j's here are jets and
these<00:00:43.230> nitro<00:00:43.590> boost<00:00:43.890> things<00:00:44.250> i'm<00:00:44.490> doing<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.940> i

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
these nitro boost things i'm doing if i

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
these nitro boost things i'm doing if i
have<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.840> j<00:00:46.080> that<00:00:46.320> lets<00:00:46.470> me<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.710> them<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> bit

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
have the j that lets me do them in a bit

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
have the j that lets me do them in a bit
air<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:50.030> I<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.420> always<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
air like that and I just always do the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.729 
air like that and I just always do the
Flip<00:00:52.260> no<00:00:52.440> matter<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.860> unless<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.670> can't<00:00:54.739> so

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
Flip no matter what unless I can't so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
Flip no matter what unless I can't so
yeah<00:00:57.380> this<00:00:58.380> is<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.830> games<00:00:59.010> i<00:00:59.160> actually

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
yeah this is one of the games i actually

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.570 
yeah this is one of the games i actually
had<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> my<00:00:59.940> gameboy<00:01:00.980> back<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.370> i<00:01:02.400> was<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
had on my gameboy back when i was a

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.570 
had on my gameboy back when i was a
little<00:01:02.640> kid<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:04.759> thing's<00:01:05.759> display<00:01:06.300> was<00:01:06.509> crap

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
little kid that thing's display was crap

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
little kid that thing's display was crap
so<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> mean<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> emulators<00:01:10.050> you<00:01:10.350> notice

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so I mean in the emulators you notice

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
so I mean in the emulators you notice
like<00:01:11.009> everything<00:01:11.490> looks<00:01:11.640> perfect<00:01:12.240> there's<00:01:12.990> no

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
like everything looks perfect there's no

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
like everything looks perfect there's no
problems<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.759> go<00:01:14.940> back<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
problems but then when you go back to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
problems but then when you go back to
playing<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.660> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> actual<00:01:16.259> system<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
playing them on the actual system you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
playing them on the actual system you
notice<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.820> problems<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
notice all the problems that you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
notice all the problems that you
completely<00:01:19.110> forget<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
completely forget about because the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.389 
completely forget about because the
emulators<00:01:20.910> don't<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:22.070> like<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
emulators don't have them like the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.420 
emulators don't have them like the
really<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.850> blurry<00:01:24.390> display<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.430> it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really really blurry display here it's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.990 
really really blurry display here it's
not<00:01:26.550> really<00:01:26.670> blurry<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.390> motion<00:01:27.869> blur

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
not really blurry it's just motion blur

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
not really blurry it's just motion blur
that's<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> response<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.410> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
that's because the response time is so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.900 
that's because the response time is so
slow<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:34.350> takes<00:01:34.619> pixels<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.250> while<00:01:35.399> to<00:01:35.610> change

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
slow it takes pixels a while to change

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.309 
slow it takes pixels a while to change
so<00:01:38.910> anything<00:01:39.240> moving<00:01:39.810> would<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:39.990> really

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
so anything moving would be really

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.020 
so anything moving would be really
really<00:01:40.560> crabby<00:01:41.100> looking<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.580> around<00:01:44.789> that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
really crabby looking to get around that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.139 
really crabby looking to get around that
some<00:01:45.509> games<00:01:46.280> lowered<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> amount<00:01:47.789> of<00:01:47.880> times

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
some games lowered the amount of times

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.660 
some games lowered the amount of times
they<00:01:48.690> update<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> scrolling<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.220> some

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
they update the scrolling so some

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.279 
they update the scrolling so some
gameboy<00:01:51.119> games<00:01:51.330> look<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.780> choppy<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
gameboy games look really choppy and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.109 
gameboy games look really choppy and
it's<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.649> because<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.039> processor<00:01:53.610> sucks<00:01:53.910> or

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it's not because the processor sucks or

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.520 
it's not because the processor sucks or
anything<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.569> just<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:56.160> screen<00:01:56.459> sucks

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.840 

aren't<00:02:01.530> even<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> processor<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.340> slower<00:02:02.730> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
aren't even the processor is slower I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.960 
aren't even the processor is slower I
have<00:02:03.060> no<00:02:03.270> idea<00:02:04.010> I'm<00:02:05.010> just<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.400> programmer<00:02:05.850> i

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
have no idea I'm just a programmer i

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.700 
have no idea I'm just a programmer i
have<00:02:06.060> no<00:02:06.180> idea<00:02:06.420> how<00:02:06.570> hardware<00:02:07.020> works<00:02:07.140> Matt

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
have no idea how hardware works Matt

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
have no idea how hardware works Matt
almost<00:02:10.710> done<00:02:11.010> here<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:12.470> whoopee<00:02:14.960> wow
