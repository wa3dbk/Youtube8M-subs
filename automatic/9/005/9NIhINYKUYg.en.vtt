00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.579
 put number five kids we have the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.289
 gentlemen pain trick that will send you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.449
 a clip with your motorcycle on which you will catch 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.249
 a small straight to catch this stretch 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 of stairs do a super back flip on 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.210
 the air and before falling on the roof see 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 that has a kind of square to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 to fall just that small space was what 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.130
 hardest of acrobatics 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.689
 falls in the hallway was just so 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.729
 more complicated that I had the backflip was 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.350
 a little bit easier but fall here without 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.609
 give yourself with no curb or anything else 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.299
 difficult so good click let's see with 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.299
 number four talent 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.000
 in position number 4 we will have to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.860
 fair play gameplay who is going to be a 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.080
 acrobatics with his motorcycle which we see here 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.180
 How is a flip going accommodating the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.030
 moto and will not fall down no not 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.000
 it falls not ah and it reaches here below the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.800
 airport where the esplanade is but 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.920
 is that it is very good because it does not fall 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.409
 thinking all and if it will fall but not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 and I'm going to show this position in number 3 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.369
 already with the bronze we are going to find a 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.409
 very good weather liked very much the lord 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.729
 Juan for which he will take a lot 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.950
 speed in this airport of the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.360
 saints showed with their in marmosets to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.040
 start putting the slow cameras to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.220
 prepare and take the greatest grace 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.020
 possible for here to give 123 and already without 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.970
 count the sayings that gives ten laps 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.070
 of bell in the air to fall on 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.659
 this building in a clean and perfect way 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.740
 the truth is that the clip is impressive 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.140
 I liked it so good 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.610
 we are also going with the money and in the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.410
 position number two we have one that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.930
 was very close to the number one that 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.090
 it's peter lang and the no des peter j 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.100
 well as we can see well here with 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 our bike grabbing the turbos does 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.840
 there is a strategic leap throughout the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.360
 wall is going to run to get here to 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.489
 the opt for it is incredible requires 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.620
 of a lot of technique to be able to do what 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.840
 did on the wall of the building and with the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.260
 turbos help a lot more so 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.000
 Peter j are in position number 2 and 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.860
 I'm going to appear in this position number 1 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.750

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.220
 it will be okay sir and my color which 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.160
 with your bike you will catch a lot of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.600
 speed goes I do not know how to get up here 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.190
 in this in this framework in this kind of 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.320
 advertising area is awesome yo 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.060
 I 'm blown away and a truth that is 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.290
 it deserves practically the most 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.970
 number one you have seen that it is something 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.770
 awesome I 've never seen it that 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.660
 has seen similar things but not in this 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.580
 style is to be removed from the motorcycle 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.690
