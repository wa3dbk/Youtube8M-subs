right here and then you have a current
IP<00:00:59.839> so<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:00.799> is<00:01:00.920> gonna<00:01:01.069> be<00:01:01.280> your<00:01:01.459> IP<00:01:01.639> right

SSL which is experimental I'm not using
that<00:01:39.439> right<00:01:39.590> now<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.070> if<00:01:40.189> you<00:01:40.310> want<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.609> sure

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
you can give it a shot but just keep in

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.069 
you can give it a shot but just keep in
mind<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.759> course<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.270> experimental

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
mind that of course it is experimental

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.630 
mind that of course it is experimental
and<00:01:45.229> if<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.619> want<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.859> send<00:01:46.009> crash<00:01:46.219> reports

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
then you can do so just by toggling that

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.989

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
the process right here and it's really

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.230 
the process right here and it's really
straightforward<00:01:54.799> if<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:55.729> go<00:01:55.820> over<00:01:55.850> here<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
straightforward if we go over here and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.749 
straightforward if we go over here and
just<00:01:56.600> open<00:01:56.840> up<00:01:56.929> Chrome<00:01:57.200> all<00:01:57.859> we<00:01:58.100> want<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.369> do<00:01:58.520> is

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
just open up Chrome all we want to do is

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:06.149 
just open up Chrome all we want to do is
type<00:01:59.119> in<00:01:59.329> this<00:01:59.749> address<00:02:00.229> right<00:02:00.350> here<00:02:00.770> so

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.500 

192.168.0.1<00:02:07.159> hundred<00:02:07.609> and<00:02:07.819> then<00:02:08.240> we're<00:02:08.420> going

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
192.168.0.1 hundred and then we're going

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.690 
192.168.0.1 hundred and then we're going
to<00:02:08.600> type<00:02:08.870> in<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> pork

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
to type in the pork

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.620 
to type in the pork
so<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.330> want<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.630> put<00:02:10.810> :<00:02:11.319> 3<00:02:12.010> 3<00:02:12.310> 3<00:02:12.490> hit<00:02:13.150> enter<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
so you want to put : 3 3 3 hit enter and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.270 
so you want to put : 3 3 3 hit enter and
then<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.020> should<00:02:14.170> get<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.349> pop-up<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.980> here

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
then you should get a pop-up right here

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.910 
then you should get a pop-up right here
asking<00:02:16.239> for<00:02:16.270> your<00:02:16.650> credentials<00:02:17.650> I've

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
asking for your credentials I've

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.440 
asking for your credentials I've
actually<00:02:18.190> already<00:02:18.489> logged<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.270> can

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
actually already logged in so you can

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.850 
actually already logged in so you can
see<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:20.050> getting<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.470> right<00:02:20.709> now

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
see that I'm not getting that right now

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.110 
see that I'm not getting that right now
just<00:02:21.370> because<00:02:21.580> I've<00:02:21.700> already<00:02:21.849> verified

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
just because I've already verified

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.290 
just because I've already verified
myself<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.920> exactly<00:02:24.520> what<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.270> looks

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
myself but this is exactly what it looks

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.600 
myself but this is exactly what it looks
like<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.069> we<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.580> of

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
want to do that this is experimental so

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.490 
want to do that this is experimental so
keep<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.239> mind<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.690> could<00:03:32.019> also<00:03:32.170> change

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
keep that in mind you could also change

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.710

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
up the appearance if you want to do that

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.949 
up the appearance if you want to do that
so<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.530> change<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.100> font<00:03:36.430> from<00:03:37.150> Ariel<00:03:37.630> to

so you can change the font from Ariel to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.020 
so you can change the font from Ariel to
Miranda<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.579> CETA

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
Miranda to the CETA

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.240 
Miranda to the CETA
grande<00:03:40.600> or<00:03:40.840> however<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.290> say<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:42.130> can

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
grande or however you say that you can

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.910 
grande or however you say that you can
also<00:03:42.370> change<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.120> theme<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:44.530> iOS

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
also change the theme so you have iOS

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.130 
also change the theme so you have iOS
which<00:03:45.370> doesn't<00:03:45.850> really<00:03:45.970> look<00:03:46.150> like<00:03:46.209> iOS<00:03:46.870> I

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
which doesn't really look like iOS I

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.120 
which doesn't really look like iOS I
guess<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.410> does<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> little<00:03:47.739> bit<00:03:47.890> the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
guess it does a little bit the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.490 
guess it does a little bit the
conversations<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:49.989> can<00:03:50.109> see<00:03:50.290> right

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
conversations do but you can see right

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.039 
conversations do but you can see right
here<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.190> go<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.489> 7<00:03:52.420> then<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:52.660> gonna<00:03:52.750> move

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
here if we go to 7 then it's gonna move

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
here if we go to 7 then it's gonna move
the<00:03:53.319> contacts<00:03:53.920> over<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.640> left<00:03:54.819> hand<00:03:54.970> side

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the contacts over to the left hand side

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.030 
the contacts over to the left hand side
so<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> mean<00:03:56.140> it's<00:03:56.260> really<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.530> depending<00:03:56.950> on

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
so I mean it's really just depending on

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.710 
so I mean it's really just depending on
your<00:03:57.220> preference<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.850> how<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.359> it<00:03:58.390> set

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
your preference and how you like it set

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.750 
your preference and how you like it set
up<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.799> probably<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.310> one<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.640> would

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
up this is probably the one that I would

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.150 
up this is probably the one that I would
actually<00:04:01.180> go<00:04:01.299> for<00:04:01.600> but<00:04:02.590> we're<00:04:02.769> gonna<00:04:02.859> close

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
actually go for but we're gonna close

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.800 
actually go for but we're gonna close
out<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.430> this<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.150> just<00:04:04.180> want<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.540> show<00:04:04.750> you
