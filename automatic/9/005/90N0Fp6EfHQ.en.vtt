okay<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.560> then<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.860> center<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.870> what<00:02:11.870> she<00:02:12.170> is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320

okay and then the center of what she is
on<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.860> little<00:02:13.130> piece<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.520> coral<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.090> believe

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on this little piece of coral I believe

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.230 
on this little piece of coral I believe
Michelle<00:02:14.810> said<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.760> going<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.209> a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
Michelle said it was is going to be a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.830 
Michelle said it was is going to be a
value<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:17.870> I'm<00:02:17.959> going<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.140> make<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.530> darker

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
value but I'm going to make it darker

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.390 
value but I'm going to make it darker
I'm<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.050> trying<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.410> build<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.770> up<00:02:21.980> slow

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
I'm just trying to build this up slow

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.330 
I'm just trying to build this up slow
and<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:23.870> rush<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.560> much<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.070> did<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and not rush it so much like I did the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.610 
and not rush it so much like I did the
last<00:02:25.520> one<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.610> very<00:02:29.060> symmetrical<00:02:29.930> right<00:02:30.350> in

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
last one so very symmetrical right in

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.740 
last one so very symmetrical right in
the<00:02:30.800> center<00:02:31.100> when<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.760> taught<00:02:32.150> composition

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the center when we I taught composition

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.870 
the center when we I taught composition
I<00:02:32.840> talked<00:02:33.140> about<00:02:33.350> symmetrical<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.700> can

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
I talked about symmetrical and you can

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.000 
I talked about symmetrical and you can
see<00:02:35.030> there's<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.270> grid<00:02:35.630> on<00:02:35.660> all<00:02:36.050> these<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.590> I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
see there's a grid on all these and I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.860 
see there's a grid on all these and I
just<00:02:37.310> wanted<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.820> students<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.239> put<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> grid

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
just wanted the students to put the grid

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.990 
just wanted the students to put the grid
there<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.739> when<00:02:39.980> they<00:02:40.130> work<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.520> their<00:02:40.730> final

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
there so when they work on their final

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.570 
there so when they work on their final
it'll<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.959> proportion<00:02:42.260> you're<00:02:43.190> there

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
it'll be in proportion you're there

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.300 
it'll be in proportion you're there
sketch<00:02:43.940> will<00:02:44.750> totally<00:02:45.320> be<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.650> proportion<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
sketch will totally be in proportion to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.729 
sketch will totally be in proportion to
their<00:02:47.230> big<00:02:48.230> piece<00:02:48.700> ok<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.050> now<00:02:51.050> let's<00:02:51.080> pop<00:02:51.709> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
their big piece ok so now let's pop it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.400 
their big piece ok so now let's pop it
and<00:02:52.010> we<00:02:52.370> would<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.730> gradation<00:02:53.170> let's<00:02:54.170> cancel

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
and we would do a gradation let's cancel

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.440 
and we would do a gradation let's cancel
that<00:02:54.709> lets<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.550> hold<00:02:58.550> on<00:02:58.730> let<00:02:59.300> me<00:02:59.330> just

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
that lets just so hold on let me just

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.680 
that lets just so hold on let me just
kind<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.110> lesson<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:00.980> these<00:03:01.190> things<00:03:01.690> let's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
kind of lesson all these things let's

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.630 
kind of lesson all these things let's
get<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.870> bigger<00:03:03.110> brush<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:07.310> I'm<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.580> to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
get a bigger brush so I'm going to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.320 
get a bigger brush so I'm going to
lighten<00:03:08.060> all<00:03:08.269> around<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.989> girl<00:03:13.060> okay<00:03:14.060> and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
lighten all around the girl okay and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.120 
lighten all around the girl okay and
let's<00:03:14.780> lighten<00:03:15.019> over<00:03:15.320> here<00:03:15.560> on<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.860> side<00:03:15.920> so

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
let's lighten over here on this side so

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
let's lighten over here on this side so
we're<00:03:16.459> going<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.640> make<00:03:16.880> her<00:03:17.060> really<00:03:17.450> pop<00:03:17.900> out

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
we're going to make her really pop out

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.580 
we're going to make her really pop out
so<00:03:20.150> there's<00:03:20.360> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.540> be<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.720> gradation<00:03:21.079> in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
so there's going to be a gradation in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.830 
so there's going to be a gradation in
the<00:03:21.739> water<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.310> let's<00:03:23.180> make<00:03:23.360> sure<00:03:23.390> we<00:03:23.720> get

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the water and let's make sure we get

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.660 
the water and let's make sure we get
these<00:03:23.989> negative<00:03:24.410> spaces<00:03:24.920> let's<00:03:25.220> go<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:25.640> more

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
these negative spaces let's go one more

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.690 
these negative spaces let's go one more
time<00:03:25.820> right<00:03:26.329> around<00:03:26.720> her<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.440> right<00:03:27.709> away<00:03:27.860> our

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
time right around her so right away our

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.100 
time right around her so right away our
value<00:03:29.090> contrast<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.630> going<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> be<00:03:29.930> at<00:03:30.019> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
value contrast is going to be at the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.860 
value contrast is going to be at the
girls<00:03:30.350> hair<00:03:32.200> okay<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.760> our<00:03:34.760> sharp<00:03:35.269> edge<00:03:35.510> even

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
girls hair okay and our sharp edge even

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.470 
girls hair okay and our sharp edge even
though<00:03:36.140> hair<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.590> soft<00:03:36.950> or<00:03:37.820> sharp<00:03:38.180> edge<00:03:38.329> is

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
though hair is soft or sharp edge is

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.660 
though hair is soft or sharp edge is
going<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.690> be<00:03:38.810> at<00:03:38.959> her<00:03:39.140> hair<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.650> at<00:03:39.890> her<00:03:40.130> shirt

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
going to be at her hair and at her shirt

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.550 
going to be at her hair and at her shirt
shoulder<00:03:41.239> area<00:03:41.600> that's<00:03:41.810> where<00:03:42.019> I'd<00:03:42.140> make<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
shoulder area that's where I'd make the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.199 
shoulder area that's where I'd make the
edges<00:03:42.680> really<00:03:43.370> hard<00:03:45.519> okay<00:03:46.519> bear<00:03:46.880> with<00:03:47.060> me<00:03:47.180> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
edges really hard okay bear with me a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.729 
edges really hard okay bear with me a
little<00:03:47.420> bit<00:03:47.600> longer<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:48.019> just<00:03:48.230> really<00:03:48.500> want<00:03:48.680> to

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
little bit longer I just really want to

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.240 
little bit longer I just really want to
make<00:03:49.070> this<00:03:49.130> work<00:03:49.519> for<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.820> guys<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:51.019> this

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
make this work for you guys so this

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.740 
make this work for you guys so this
tales<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.640> jellyfish

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.440 

and<00:03:57.750> then<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.349> top<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> water<00:03:59.299> I'm<00:04:00.299> going

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
and then the top of the water I'm going

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.000 
and then the top of the water I'm going
to<00:04:00.510> go<00:04:00.659> dark<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.290> top<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.709> water<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
to go dark with the top of the water I

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.580 
to go dark with the top of the water I
think<00:04:02.269> yeah<00:04:03.269> let's<00:04:03.450> switch<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:03.989> let's<00:04:04.379> go

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
think yeah let's switch it up let's go

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.289 
think yeah let's switch it up let's go
dark<00:04:04.860> with<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.159> top<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.549> water<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:08.299> should

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
dark with the top of the water I should

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.350 
dark with the top of the water I should
be<00:04:09.420> done<00:04:09.629> shortly<00:04:10.099> so<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:14.400> would<00:04:14.580> kind<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.239> be

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
be done shortly so this would kind of be

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.050 
be done shortly so this would kind of be
our<00:04:15.390> top<00:04:16.109> plane<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.650> we<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.400> play<00:04:17.639> with<00:04:17.850> this

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
our top plane and we can play with this

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.840 
our top plane and we can play with this
and<00:04:18.389> we<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.900> actually<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.459> gradation

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
and we can actually do a gradation

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.420 
and we can actually do a gradation
coming<00:04:21.660> down<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.019> we<00:04:22.139> can<00:04:22.290> do<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.800> much<00:04:22.979> up<00:04:23.220> up

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
coming down so we can do so much up up

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.790 
coming down so we can do so much up up
here<00:04:23.699> in<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.210> sky<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.080> depends<00:04:25.650> on

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
here in the in the sky it depends on

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.770 
here in the in the sky it depends on
where<00:04:26.010> how<00:04:26.190> far<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.550> want<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.790> take<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.180> if

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
where how far you want to take this if

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.360 
where how far you want to take this if
at<00:04:28.020> all<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.320> time<00:04:28.530> in<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.680> world<00:04:28.770> I'd<00:04:29.070> really

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
at all the time in the world I'd really

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.750 
at all the time in the world I'd really
pop<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.789> so<00:04:29.910> now<00:04:30.120> what<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.139> would<00:04:31.380> do<00:04:31.590> is<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.550> go

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
pop it so now what I would do is just go

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.480 
pop it so now what I would do is just go
back<00:04:33.289> let's<00:04:34.289> choose<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.979> light<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.310> once

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
back let's choose the light and once

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.439 
back let's choose the light and once
again<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:40.289> let's<00:04:41.010> just<00:04:41.130> tweak<00:04:41.610> some<00:04:41.910> little

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
again and let's just tweak some little

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.779 
again and let's just tweak some little
details<00:04:42.840> over<00:04:43.169> here<00:04:43.350> let's<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:43.710> put<00:04:44.580> some

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
details over here let's just put some

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.670 
details over here let's just put some
highlights<00:04:45.240> i<00:04:45.630> think<00:04:46.110> i'm<00:04:46.199> just<00:04:46.229> going<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.530> up

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
highlights i think i'm just going to up

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.629 
highlights i think i'm just going to up
the<00:04:46.830> opacity<00:04:48.620> right<00:04:49.620> around<00:04:49.919> turn<00:04:50.220> now<00:04:50.370> we<00:04:50.490> got

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
the opacity right around turn now we got

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.159 
the opacity right around turn now we got
to<00:04:50.760> feather<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.060> off<00:04:51.300> we<00:04:51.510> don't<00:04:51.690> want<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.020> be

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
to feather it off we don't want it to be

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.980 
to feather it off we don't want it to be
so<00:04:52.470> obvious<00:04:53.070> that<00:04:53.370> we're<00:04:54.150> trying<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.630> make<00:04:54.780> her

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
so obvious that we're trying to make her

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.510 
so obvious that we're trying to make her
pop<00:04:55.229> out<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.680> everything<00:04:56.160> else<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.490> just

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
pop out and everything else is just

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.490 
pop out and everything else is just
going<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.990> i<00:04:58.020> put<00:04:58.320> like<00:04:58.470> little

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
going to be so i put like little

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.420 
going to be so i put like little
highlights<00:04:59.160> on<00:04:59.370> all<00:04:59.550> this<00:04:59.760> stuff<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:02.070> trails

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
highlights on all this stuff the trails

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.279 
highlights on all this stuff the trails
of<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.820> jellyfish<00:05:03.360> I'd<00:05:03.570> kind<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.960> have<00:05:04.110> them

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
of the jellyfish I'd kind of have them

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.120 
of the jellyfish I'd kind of have them
going<00:05:04.500> across<00:05:06.289> so<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.380> have<00:05:07.620> layers<00:05:07.919> of

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
going across so you have layers of

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.580 
going across so you have layers of
things<00:05:08.520> like<00:05:08.729> in<00:05:08.910> front<00:05:09.270> like<00:05:09.479> I'd<00:05:09.630> pop<00:05:09.930> this

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
things like in front like I'd pop this

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.320 
things like in front like I'd pop this
is<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> book<00:05:11.160> so<00:05:11.400> I'd<00:05:11.490> make<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.820> book<00:05:12.030> if<00:05:12.150> that's

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
is a book so I'd make the book if that's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.000 
is a book so I'd make the book if that's
really<00:05:12.539> important<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.229> story<00:05:13.440> maybe<00:05:13.740> make

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
really important to the story maybe make

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.580 
really important to the story maybe make
her<00:05:14.130> skin<00:05:14.340> tone<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.580> little<00:05:14.639> bit<00:05:14.910> lighter

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
her skin tone a little bit lighter

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.850 
her skin tone a little bit lighter
depending<00:05:16.590> on<00:05:16.590> what<00:05:17.130> she<00:05:17.490> is<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.650> let's

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860

part of it if you decide to watch us
this<00:05:58.939> is<00:05:59.120> how<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.270> would<00:05:59.539> handle<00:05:59.979> this<00:06:00.979> sketch

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
this is how I would handle this sketch

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.040 
this is how I would handle this sketch
okay<00:06:01.969> let's<00:06:02.210> just<00:06:02.270> kind<00:06:02.449> of<00:06:02.539> make<00:06:02.689> our<00:06:02.840> face

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
okay let's just kind of make our face

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.200 
okay let's just kind of make our face
glow<00:06:03.439> a<00:06:03.469> little<00:06:03.800> bit<00:06:03.919> more<00:06:04.099> and<00:06:04.310> so<00:06:04.909> now<00:06:05.150> you

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
glow a little bit more and so now you

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.059 
glow a little bit more and so now you
look<00:06:05.599> right<00:06:05.960> at<00:06:06.199> her<00:06:06.379> face<00:06:06.650> now<00:06:06.860> it's

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
look right at her face now it's

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.659 
look right at her face now it's
incorrect<00:06:07.580> because<00:06:08.349> you<00:06:09.349> know<00:06:09.439> you<00:06:09.500> you<00:06:10.490> can

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
incorrect because you know you you can

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.490 
incorrect because you know you you can
also<00:06:10.819> want<00:06:11.120> let's<00:06:11.360> just<00:06:11.750> do<00:06:11.900> one<00:06:12.110> last<00:06:12.349> thing
