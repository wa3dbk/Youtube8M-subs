hey<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:01.879> this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.060> Spyderco<00:00:03.570> paramilitary

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
hey guys this is a Spyderco paramilitary

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.970 
hey guys this is a Spyderco paramilitary
-<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.879> this<00:00:05.879> isn't<00:00:06.290> it<00:00:07.290> can<00:00:07.589> be<00:00:07.740> very

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
- and this isn't it can be very

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
- and this isn't it can be very
difficult<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.760> tell<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.389> fake<00:00:10.170> from<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> real

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
difficult to tell a fake from a real

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.990 
difficult to tell a fake from a real
paramilitary<00:00:12.000> -<00:00:12.710> just<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> picture<00:00:14.370> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
paramilitary - just from a picture it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.580 
paramilitary - just from a picture it
can<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.360> very<00:00:15.599> difficult<00:00:15.780> even<00:00:16.199> through<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
can be very difficult even through a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.279 
can be very difficult even through a
video<00:00:17.000> once<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.119> hold<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.660> hand<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
video once you hold it in your hand it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
video once you hold it in your hand it
becomes<00:00:19.470> much<00:00:19.830> easier<00:00:20.270> unfortunately<00:00:21.270> at

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
becomes much easier unfortunately at

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.150 
becomes much easier unfortunately at
that<00:00:21.570> point<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.990> probably<00:00:22.199> already<00:00:22.650> paid<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that point you probably already paid a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.730 
that point you probably already paid a
lot<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.519> money<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.529> piece<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.680> junk<00:00:27.740> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
lot of money for a piece of junk that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.609 
lot of money for a piece of junk that
happens<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> lately<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.750> been<00:00:30.779> watching

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
happens and lately I have been watching

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.880 
happens and lately I have been watching
a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.099> fake<00:00:32.880> versus<00:00:33.329> real<00:00:33.680> paramilitary<00:00:34.680> -

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
a lot of fake versus real paramilitary -

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
a lot of fake versus real paramilitary -
videos<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.170> seen<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> few<00:00:37.860> things<00:00:39.320> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
videos and I have seen a few things that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.100 
videos and I have seen a few things that
keep<00:00:40.649> reoccurring<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.820> few<00:00:42.329> differences<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
keep reoccurring a few differences that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.250 
keep reoccurring a few differences that
keep<00:00:43.320> reoccurring<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.090> could<00:00:45.870> tell<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
keep reoccurring now I could tell you a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.130 
keep reoccurring now I could tell you a
lot<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.809> different<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
lot of things that are different and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.459 
lot of things that are different and
this<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> I'm<00:00:52.260> just

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
this one and in this one but I'm just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950 
this one and in this one but I'm just
going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> focus<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.250> those<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.510> I've<00:00:54.660> seen

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to focus on those that I've seen

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
going to focus on those that I've seen
reoccur<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.010> almost<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.420> videos<00:00:57.750> I've

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
reoccur and almost all the videos I've

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
reoccur and almost all the videos I've
watched<00:00:59.000> well<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> first<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
watched well the first one is the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.609 
watched well the first one is the
direction<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.010> jimping<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.619> I'm

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
direction of this jimping right here I'm

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.890 
direction of this jimping right here I'm
going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> use<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.310> two<00:01:08.549> plastic<00:01:08.790> straws<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
going to use these two plastic straws to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.460 
going to use these two plastic straws to
show<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> direction<00:01:11.750> this<00:01:12.750> jimping<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
show you the direction this jimping is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.170 
show you the direction this jimping is
facing<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:15.119> direction<00:01:15.619> yes<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.060> with<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
facing this direction yes and with the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.969 
facing this direction yes and with the
real<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.930> jimping<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.040> facing<00:01:21.860> about

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.490 

yeah<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.430> direction<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> hoping<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.350> can

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
yeah this direction so hoping you can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.060 
yeah this direction so hoping you can
see<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> much<00:01:30.119> larger<00:01:30.630> angle<00:01:31.070> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
see it this is a much larger angle some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
see it this is a much larger angle some
much<00:01:32.189> smaller<00:01:32.549> angle<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.180> actually<00:01:33.600> much

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
much smaller angle this is actually much

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
much smaller angle this is actually much
better<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.380> keep<00:01:34.530> your<00:01:34.590> thumb<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> place<00:01:35.340> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
better to keep your thumb in place this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.710 
better to keep your thumb in place this
is<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.299> much<00:01:37.020> sharper<00:01:38.659> unfortunately<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
is also much sharper unfortunately you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.590 
is also much sharper unfortunately you
cannot<00:01:39.930> tell<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> through<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> picture<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
cannot tell that through a picture the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.069 
cannot tell that through a picture the
second<00:01:46.079> construction<00:01:46.560> site<00:01:46.970> which<00:01:48.079> doesn't

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
second construction site which doesn't

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.340 
second construction site which doesn't
fit<00:01:49.110> almost<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.960> locking

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
fit almost at all is the locking

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.580 
fit almost at all is the locking
mechanism<00:01:52.939> now<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.630> hoping<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.320> able<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
mechanism now I'm hoping to be able to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.969 
mechanism now I'm hoping to be able to
do<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.920> without<00:01:56.130> much<00:01:56.520> glare<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.180> camera

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
do this without much glare in the camera

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.090 
do this without much glare in the camera
maybe<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.310> pick<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> up<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:01.409> shape<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
maybe you can pick it up the shape of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
maybe you can pick it up the shape of
the<00:02:02.820> locking<00:02:03.210> mechanism<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.960> different

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the locking mechanism is different

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.740 
the locking mechanism is different
this<00:02:07.079> corner<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.250> sharp<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
this corner right here is sharp for the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.110 
this corner right here is sharp for the
fake<00:02:09.989> model<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.400> rounded<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
fake model so this one it's rounded and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.710 
fake model so this one it's rounded and
the<00:02:15.120> cutout<00:02:15.599> in<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.950> liner<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.819> g10<00:02:18.299> so

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the cutout in the liner and the g10 so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.220 
the cutout in the liner and the g10 so
you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.989> access<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.799> locking<00:02:20.160> mechanism<00:02:21.230> for

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
you can access the locking mechanism for

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.080 
you can access the locking mechanism for
the<00:02:22.349> Spyderco<00:02:22.830> paramilitary<00:02:23.549> it's<00:02:23.819> very

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the Spyderco paramilitary it's very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.699 
the Spyderco paramilitary it's very
smooth<00:02:24.540> there's<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.110> smooth<00:02:25.500> transition

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
smooth there's a very smooth transition

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.640 
smooth there's a very smooth transition
here<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.760> drag<00:02:27.239> your<00:02:27.569> index<00:02:28.290> finger

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
here if you just drag your index finger

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.750 
here if you just drag your index finger
on<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.890> back<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.849> knife<00:02:30.000> very<00:02:30.629> smooth

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
on the back of the knife very smooth

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
on the back of the knife very smooth
with<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.269> fake<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.379> feel<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
with the fake one you can feel the

make a few cuts in cardboard and it will

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.120 
make a few cuts in cardboard and it will
go<00:04:23.070> dull<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.949> I<00:04:26.340> hope<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.449> video<00:04:28.070> helped<00:04:29.070> you
