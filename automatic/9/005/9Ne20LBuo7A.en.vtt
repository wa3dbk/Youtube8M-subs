00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:09.300
 The seat is this time of here theme of Hello world rubber market 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 I want to introduce 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:21.030
 It is hard to take out the serve of the rotation that the pen holder was rotating. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:26.170
 I would like to introduce 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:32.020
 It is this theme this time, but surprisingly that 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 Since there were a lot of questions and such in the e-mail magazine's 8 mail magazine, I introduce it this time 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.160
 I think that I want to do it 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 Here is that but if you can put it out 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 It does not mean that it will be like this if it can be put out 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 I think that I want to explain that there 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.590
 Well this 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.590
 Though it is easy 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.370
 Speaking of penholder 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.740
 I cut it like this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:05.030
 Salmon roe 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:09.780
 And in parallel the racket Fu say it is this even as trying to buy a ball 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.840
 Actually, when it comes to serving , it has become difficult to become parallel 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.439
 Say or why 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.640
 Most people have left foot before left foot 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:24.319
 It's right Konoha, and I'm getting center of gravity in the front leg 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.789
 If you think that you want to put out at such time, the noodles will be inclined like this by all means 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.789
 It means that the head will go down 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.880
 I put it 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 So what should I do? 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.320
 When you issue a Saab 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:52.580
 It is to say Nokkeru the foot edge body weight of more of here behind 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.580
 As it is beautiful to the noodles of the Therefore, in this parallel it is doing so 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.890
 Masu Kase eh 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.440
 a 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.670
 a 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:25.540
 Well there is also the merit of the serve of the side rotation system of side rotation and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:31.650
 There is a merit of rotation that I served this vertical rotation system after this, but this 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.650
 Anyone who does not put out firm Saab directly below the absolutely and penholder 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.490
 Behind this weight 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.450
 That it says make noodles 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.450
 Please try a little and I hope you find it helpful
