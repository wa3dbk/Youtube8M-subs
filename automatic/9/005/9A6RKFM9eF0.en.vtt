I<00:00:35.380> originally<00:00:36.380> started<00:00:37.030> taking<00:00:38.030> belly<00:00:38.600> dance

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
I originally started taking belly dance

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.500 
I originally started taking belly dance
because<00:00:39.200> I<00:00:39.380> was<00:00:39.500> looking<00:00:39.740> for<00:00:40.270> a<00:00:41.270> different

because I was looking for a different

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.120 
because I was looking for a different
form<00:00:41.840> of<00:00:41.870> exercise<00:00:42.110> something<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.860> would<00:00:43.010> be

fun<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.030> think<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:44.360> also<00:00:44.510> offers<00:00:45.080> a<00:00:45.170> different

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
fun I think it also offers a different

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.310 
fun I think it also offers a different
perspective<00:00:45.680> but<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.670> American<00:00:47.000> perspective

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
perspective but the American perspective

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.440
