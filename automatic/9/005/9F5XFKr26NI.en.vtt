00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
believe this is a 14 inch hopefully it's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
believe this is a 14 inch hopefully it's
a<00:01:14.310> 16<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.329> at<00:01:15.509> unstretched<00:01:16.140> length

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a 16 because it's at unstretched length

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.219 
a 16 because it's at unstretched length
so<00:01:17.070> we'll<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.469> it<00:01:19.469> is<00:01:20.039> kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.670> damp<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.249 
so we'll see it is kind of damp and it
is<00:01:22.350> supposed<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> deep<00:01:23.310> wave<00:01:23.579> so<00:01:27.259> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
is supposed to be a deep wave so it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
is supposed to be a deep wave so it
doesn't<00:01:28.680> stink<00:01:28.969> it<00:01:29.969> does<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
