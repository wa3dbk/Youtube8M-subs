00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
in the long term is that we try and

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.459 
in the long term is that we try and
identify<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:23.290> types<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.310> resources<00:02:25.439> not<00:02:26.439> just

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
identify all types of resources not just

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.179 
identify all types of resources not just
print<00:02:27.189> and<00:02:27.489> not<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:28.150> electronic<00:02:29.079> but<00:02:29.920> also

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
print and not just electronic but also

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.800 
print and not just electronic but also
the<00:02:30.730> multimedia<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:34.209> grey<00:02:34.510> literature

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the multimedia and the grey literature

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.199 
the multimedia and the grey literature
and<00:02:35.469> by<00:02:35.680> grey<00:02:35.920> literature<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.519> mean<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.969> hard

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and by grey literature I mean the hard

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.229 
and by grey literature I mean the hard
to<00:02:37.389> find<00:02:38.250> white<00:02:39.250> papers<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.560> hopefully<00:02:42.239> we

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
to find white papers and so hopefully we

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.830 
to find white papers and so hopefully we
can<00:02:43.480> make<00:02:43.689> this<00:02:43.959> more<00:02:44.469> transparent<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.519> more

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
can make this more transparent and more

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.190 
can make this more transparent and more
open<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.290> many<00:02:47.620> people<00:02:47.889> and<00:02:48.280> then<00:02:49.200> more

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
open for many people and then more

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.309 
open for many people and then more
research<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.919> be<00:02:50.950> built<00:02:51.310> upon<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:52.319> having

research can be built upon that having

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.199 
research can be built upon that having

with<00:03:10.689> animals<00:03:11.109> for<00:03:11.409> since<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.219> we<00:03:12.400> lived<00:03:12.639> in

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
with animals for since I we lived in

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.699 
with animals for since I we lived in
villages<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.480> animals<00:03:14.139> were<00:03:14.260> always<00:03:14.620> very

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
villages and animals were always very

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.670 
villages and animals were always very
important<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:16.239> turns<00:03:16.540> out<00:03:16.840> there<00:03:17.260> was<00:03:17.379> more

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
important it turns out there was more

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.990 
important it turns out there was more
and<00:03:17.709> more<00:03:17.859> empirical<00:03:18.280> evidence<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.879> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
and more empirical evidence that the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.460 
and more empirical evidence that the
relationship<00:03:19.449> was<00:03:19.629> more<00:03:20.199> than<00:03:20.409> just

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
relationship was more than just

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.030 
relationship was more than just
companionship<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.879> more<00:03:22.659> than<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:23.169> fun<00:03:23.500> it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
companionship and more than just fun it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.399 
companionship and more than just fun it
really<00:03:24.519> started<00:03:24.790> changing<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:26.199> health

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
really started changing the health

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.409 
really started changing the health
profiles<00:03:26.889> of<00:03:27.129> people<00:03:27.250> obviously<00:03:27.669> the<00:03:28.060> animals

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
profiles of people obviously the animals

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.750 
profiles of people obviously the animals
benefit<00:03:28.870> from<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.139> relationship<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
benefit from the relationship so the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.309 
benefit from the relationship so the
study<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.359> really<00:03:31.540> understand<00:03:32.079> what<00:03:32.199> are

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
study is to really understand what are

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.550 
study is to really understand what are
the<00:03:32.409> what's<00:03:33.220> really<00:03:33.609> going<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.120> our<00:03:34.560> animals

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
the what's really going on our animals

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.409 
the what's really going on our animals
as<00:03:35.739> we<00:03:35.889> think<00:03:36.129> they<00:03:36.250> are<00:03:36.280> really<00:03:36.939> very<00:03:37.269> much

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
as we think they are really very much

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.479 
as we think they are really very much

that<00:03:40.449> it<00:03:40.720> plays<00:03:41.169> into<00:03:41.620> our<00:03:41.889> social<00:03:42.310> support

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
that it plays into our social support

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.670 
that it plays into our social support
system<00:03:43.090> where<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.269> cared<00:03:43.629> with<00:03:44.319> each<00:03:44.439> other

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
system where we cared with each other

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.550 
system where we cared with each other
very<00:03:45.489> nurturing<00:03:45.729> but<00:03:46.569> we<00:03:46.689> also<00:03:46.900> benefit<00:03:47.530> from

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
very nurturing but we also benefit from

the caring and nurturing of our
