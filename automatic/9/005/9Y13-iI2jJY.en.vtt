00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
know my rings are correct but if you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.110 
know my rings are correct but if you
don't<00:02:56.340> know<00:02:56.400> if<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.520> get<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> right<00:02:56.880> rings

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.810 
don't know if you get the right rings
you<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.450> check<00:02:57.630> them<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.870> this

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
you can check them like this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.880 
you can check them like this
you<00:02:59.820> put<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> piston<00:03:00.330> ring<00:03:00.720> from<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.380> old<00:03:01.650> one

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
you put the piston ring from the old one

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.050 
you put the piston ring from the old one
in<00:03:02.070> one<00:03:02.550> piston<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:04.380> see<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.890> gap<00:03:05.790> right

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
in one piston and you see that gap right

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.259 
in one piston and you see that gap right
there<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:07.260> measure<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.070> don't<00:03:09.000> want<00:03:09.209> it

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
there you measure it you don't want it

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.300 
there you measure it you don't want it
to<00:03:09.330> be<00:03:09.450> over<00:03:09.870> 40<00:03:10.790> for<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.970> particular<00:03:12.510> engine

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
to be over 40 for this particular engine

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.979 
to be over 40 for this particular engine
which<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.489> Chevrolet<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.239> wouldn't<00:03:15.660> say<00:03:15.810> over

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
which is a Chevrolet I wouldn't say over

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.670 
which is a Chevrolet I wouldn't say over
40<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.410> any<00:03:16.500> engine<00:03:18.110> anyhow<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.440> too

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
40 for any engine anyhow and if it's too

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.699 
40 for any engine anyhow and if it's too
close<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.160> got<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.400> file<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.690> put<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.320> a

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
close you got to file it you put it in a

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.120 
close you got to file it you put it in a
vise<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.870> use<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.050> file<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.860> file<00:03:26.100> on

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
vise and you use a file and you file on

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.479 
vise and you use a file and you file on
a<00:03:26.340> little<00:03:26.670> bit<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.060> then<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.720> check<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.080> again

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
a little bit and then you check it again

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.680 
a little bit and then you check it again
you<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.670> push<00:03:29.910> them<00:03:30.120> into<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.810> cylinder<00:03:31.380> hole

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
you can push them into the cylinder hole

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.930 
you can push them into the cylinder hole
squarely<00:03:33.690> by<00:03:34.620> putting<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.010> piston<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.519> upside

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
squarely by putting a piston in upside

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.300 
squarely by putting a piston in upside
down<00:03:36.230> pushing<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.590> there<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.860> be<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.010> same

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
down pushing it in there and be the same

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.979 
down pushing it in there and be the same
distance<00:03:38.489> before<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.330> just<00:03:39.510> push<00:03:39.690> in<00:03:39.870> with

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
distance before you just push in with

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.460 
distance before you just push in with
your<00:03:40.110> fingers<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.680> measure<00:03:41.610> from<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.510> piston

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
your fingers and measure from the piston

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.530 
your fingers and measure from the piston
ring<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.480> top<00:03:45.750> here<00:03:46.260> or<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.830> head<00:03:47.010> goes

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
ring to the top here or the head goes

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.160 
ring to the top here or the head goes
now<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:49.320> one<00:03:49.500> here<00:03:49.709> measured<00:03:50.100> out<00:03:50.930> less<00:03:51.930> than

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
now this one here measured out less than

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.580 
now this one here measured out less than
that<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.350> course<00:03:53.510> because<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.140> other<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:55.560> is

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
that of course because the other one is

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.330 
that of course because the other one is
worn<00:03:56.370> it's<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.510> worn<00:03:57.780> ring<00:03:58.050> so<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.070> going<00:03:59.250> to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
worn it's a worn ring so it's going to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.940 
worn it's a worn ring so it's going to
be<00:03:59.459> spread<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> little<00:03:59.940> more<00:04:00.239> part<00:04:00.590> now<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.650> way

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
be spread a little more part now the way

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.870 
be spread a little more part now the way
you<00:04:02.010> check<00:04:02.400> these<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:03.630> with<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.870> feeler<00:04:04.140> gauge

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
you check these is with a feeler gauge

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.140 
you check these is with a feeler gauge
okay

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
okay

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.220 
okay
feeler<00:04:06.690> gauge<00:04:08.570> mm<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.900> tool<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:11.959> has<00:04:12.959> all

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
feeler gauge mm is a tool that has all

feeler gauge mm is a tool that has all
these<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.620> also<00:04:13.770> has<00:04:14.069> gaps<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.760> spark<00:04:15.000> plugs

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
these it also has gaps for spark plugs

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.509 
these it also has gaps for spark plugs
on<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.690> brass<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.200> don't<00:04:16.350> use<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> brass

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
on it and brass I don't use the brass

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.820 
on it and brass I don't use the brass
and<00:04:18.109> trying<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.229> show<00:04:19.349> you<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.500> flashlight<00:04:19.919> here

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
2.16

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.689 
2.16
okay<00:04:25.139> let's<00:04:25.440> see<00:04:25.590> here<00:04:26.210> over<00:04:27.210> here<00:04:27.449> it's<00:04:28.699> 0.26

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
okay let's see here over here it's 0.26

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.570 
okay let's see here over here it's 0.26
on<00:04:29.849> this<00:04:30.000> side<00:04:30.289> then<00:04:31.289> it<00:04:31.800> goes<00:04:32.009> back<00:04:32.190> over<00:04:32.430> this

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
on this side then it goes back over this

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.850 
on this side then it goes back over this
side<00:04:33.319> 25<00:04:34.319> 24<00:04:34.949> 23<00:04:34.979> 22<00:04:35.849> to<00:04:36.180> 1<00:04:36.270> 19<00:04:36.810> 18<00:04:37.080> 17<00:04:37.110> 16<00:04:37.500> all

side 25 24 23 22 to 1 19 18 17 16 all
the<00:04:37.919> way<00:04:37.979> down<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:39.120> put<00:04:39.360> two<00:04:39.569> of<00:04:39.599> them

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the way down you put two of them

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.270 
the way down you put two of them
together<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.259> add<00:04:40.500> them<00:04:40.680> together<00:04:40.800> now<00:04:41.160> of

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
together and add them together now of

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.070 
together and add them together now of
course<00:04:41.430> you're<00:04:41.610> not<00:04:41.669> going<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:41.880> put<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.000> 25<00:04:42.449> 224

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
course you're not going to put a 25 224

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.950 
course you're not going to put a 25 224
together<00:04:43.349> but<00:04:44.009> what<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.250> will<00:04:44.430> do<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.759> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
together but what you will do is a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.140 
together but what you will do is a
sixteen<00:04:46.819> and<00:04:47.819> a<00:04:48.300> fifth<00:04:48.539> in<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.990> while<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.620> see

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
sixteen and a fifth in a while and see

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.370 
sixteen and a fifth in a while and see
this<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.360> 10<00:04:51.569> and<00:04:51.599> 16<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.620> makes<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:52.979> 26

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
this is a 10 and 16 that makes it 26

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.930 
this is a 10 and 16 that makes it 26
okay<00:04:55.380> but<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.740> have<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.889> 26<00:04:56.370> over<00:04:56.550> here<00:04:56.729> so<00:04:56.880> you

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
okay but you have a 26 over here so you

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.159 
okay but you have a 26 over here so you
can<00:04:57.090> do<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.270> either<00:04:57.360> way<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:57.569> want<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.080> can

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
can do it either way you want you can

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.809 
can do it either way you want you can
put<00:04:58.289> these<00:04:58.409> two<00:04:58.590> together<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.300> then<00:05:01.789> what<00:05:02.789> I

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
put these two together and then what I

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.320 
put these two together and then what I
usually<00:05:03.060> do<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.479> just<00:05:03.509> fan<00:05:03.870> them<00:05:04.050> out<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:06.060> see

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
usually do is just fan them out and see

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:16.390 
usually do is just fan them out and see
which<00:05:06.509> one<00:05:08.330> fits<00:05:11.150> into<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.409> brain<00:05:13.409> gap<00:05:14.539> here

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
which one fits into this brain gap here

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.740 
which one fits into this brain gap here
if<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.520> can<00:05:17.729> show<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.000> correctly<00:05:18.479> with<00:05:18.690> a

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
if I can show it correctly with a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.879 
if I can show it correctly with a
flashlight<00:05:18.990> right<00:05:20.000> there<00:05:21.080> see<00:05:22.080> whichever<00:05:22.650> one

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
flashlight right there see whichever one

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:34.530 
flashlight right there see whichever one
fits<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:27.270> one

okay 1919 fits you check your
specifications<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.110> see<00:05:42.380> if<00:05:42.470> it's<00:05:42.620> enough

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
specifications and see if it's enough

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.290 
specifications and see if it's enough
it's<00:05:44.270> not<00:05:44.540> enough<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:46.580> take<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.940> ring<00:05:47.120> out

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
it's not enough you take the ring out

00:05:47.300 --> 00:06:03.610 
it's not enough you take the ring out
the<00:05:52.750> cylinder<00:05:53.750> hole<00:06:01.479> and<00:06:02.479> you<00:06:02.690> file<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.290> same

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
the cylinder hole and you file the same

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.000 
the cylinder hole and you file the same
side<00:06:04.220> every<00:06:04.760> time<00:06:05.199> get<00:06:06.199> on<00:06:06.320> file<00:06:06.560> one<00:06:06.830> over

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
side every time get on file one over

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.000 
side every time get on file one over
here<00:06:07.310> one<00:06:08.000> over<00:06:08.030> here<00:06:08.800> file<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:10.040> same<00:06:10.280> side

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
here one over here file the same side

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.150 
here one over here file the same side
and<00:06:13.010> there<00:06:13.430> you<00:06:13.550> have<00:06:13.760> it<00:06:13.970> and<00:06:14.120> then<00:06:14.979> when<00:06:15.979> it's

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
and there you have it and then when it's

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.980 
and there you have it and then when it's
compressed<00:06:16.520> it'll<00:06:17.120> be<00:06:17.270> closer<00:06:17.540> together<00:06:18.729> and

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
compressed it'll be closer together and

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.250 
compressed it'll be closer together and
you'll<00:06:20.990> have<00:06:22.780> the<00:06:23.780> right<00:06:23.960> amount<00:06:24.200> of

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
you'll have the right amount of

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.779 
you'll have the right amount of
clearance<00:06:24.530> that's<00:06:25.250> what<00:06:25.490> you're<00:06:25.610> measuring

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
clearance that's what you're measuring

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.850 
clearance that's what you're measuring
this<00:06:26.120> gap<00:06:26.389> between<00:06:26.570> here<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.020> here<00:06:27.260> when<00:06:27.740> you

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
this gap between here and here when you

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.110 
this gap between here and here when you
put<00:06:28.070> it<00:06:28.160> in<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.340> soda<00:06:28.580> hole<00:06:28.789> you<00:06:28.910> have<00:06:28.940> to

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
put it in the soda hole you have to

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.920 
put it in the soda hole you have to
squeeze<00:06:29.330> it<00:06:29.479> together<00:06:29.570> by<00:06:29.870> hand<00:06:34.660> and<00:06:35.660> it<00:06:35.810> gets

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
squeeze it together by hand and it gets

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.700 
squeeze it together by hand and it gets
closer<00:06:36.169> see<00:06:37.180> okay<00:06:38.180> I<00:06:38.380> hope<00:06:39.380> that<00:06:39.590> was

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
closer see okay I hope that was

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.240 
closer see okay I hope that was
informative<00:06:39.830> and<00:06:41.320> I'll<00:06:42.320> get<00:06:42.710> a<00:06:42.770> couple<00:06:43.010> more

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
informative and I'll get a couple more

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.729 
informative and I'll get a couple more
videos<00:06:43.340> up
