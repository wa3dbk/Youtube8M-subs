in the bottom I like to put things like

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.149 
in the bottom I like to put things like
kitchen<00:01:45.270> roll<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> niculae<00:01:46.950> or

kitchen roll you can use the niculae or

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
kitchen roll you can use the niculae or
cocoa<00:01:47.490> fiber<00:01:47.729> you're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> need<00:01:48.659> things

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
cocoa fiber you're going to need things

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
cocoa fiber you're going to need things
like<00:01:48.960> springtails<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.040> well<00:01:50.189> though

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like springtails in there as well though

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
like springtails in there as well though
because<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.479> lot<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> will

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
because they do put a lot and it will

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:58.580 
because they do put a lot and it will
mold<00:01:52.740> quite<00:01:52.979> quickly

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.870 

temperature<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.680> humidity<00:02:59.739> wise<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.730> want

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
temperature and humidity wise you want

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.880 
temperature and humidity wise you want
to<00:03:00.940> keep<00:03:01.030> them<00:03:01.180> at<00:03:01.269> about<00:03:01.360> 18<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.320> 22<00:03:02.650> degrees

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
to keep them at about 18 to 22 degrees

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.910 
to keep them at about 18 to 22 degrees
so<00:03:03.310> room<00:03:03.610> temperature<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.150> perfect<00:03:04.570> for<00:03:04.920> your

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
so room temperature is perfect for your

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.759 
so room temperature is perfect for your
best<00:03:06.130> off<00:03:06.310> doing<00:03:06.579> things<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.970> small<00:03:07.959> mist

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
best off doing things like a small mist

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.280 
best off doing things like a small mist
once<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.610> week<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.390> leaves<00:03:10.570> never<00:03:10.870> directly

once a week on the leaves never directly

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.710 
once a week on the leaves never directly
on<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.590> insects<00:03:11.950> themselves<00:03:12.510> they'll<00:03:13.510> drink

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
on the insects themselves they'll drink

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.840 
on the insects themselves they'll drink
from<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.260> I'll<00:03:14.350> see<00:03:14.500> too<00:03:14.680> much<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.190> that

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
from that but I'll see too much in that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.490 
from that but I'll see too much in that
small<00:03:16.150> enclosure<00:03:16.540> will<00:03:16.900> build<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> lot<00:03:17.470> of

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
small enclosure will build up a lot of

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.720 
small enclosure will build up a lot of
mold<00:03:19.739> size<00:03:20.739> wise<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.280> enclosure<00:03:21.610> you

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
mold size wise for the enclosure you

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.100 
mold size wise for the enclosure you
want<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> take<00:03:22.030> into<00:03:22.180> consideration<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.810> size

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
want to take into consideration the size

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.630 
want to take into consideration the size
of<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.350> insect<00:03:23.680> you're<00:03:23.829> getting<00:03:24.100> it's<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
of the insect you're getting it's the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.520 
of the insect you're getting it's the
same<00:03:24.850> basic<00:03:25.090> principle<00:03:25.239> with<00:03:25.750> any<00:03:25.959> insect<00:03:26.440> you

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
same basic principle with any insect you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.199 
same basic principle with any insect you
get<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:27.370> need<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:27.700> have<00:03:27.880> one<00:03:28.090> that's

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
get you need to have one that's

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.080 
get you need to have one that's
adequately<00:03:28.690> sized<00:03:29.019> so<00:03:29.709> I've<00:03:30.160> got<00:03:30.430> five<00:03:30.700> or

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
adequately sized so I've got five or

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.630 
adequately sized so I've got five or
about<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.870> big<00:03:32.079> in<00:03:32.230> size<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.430> house

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
about that big in size and that house

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.110 
about that big in size and that house
doing<00:03:33.940> something<00:03:34.350> about<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.530> big<00:03:36.120> big

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
doing something about that big big

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.550 
doing something about that big big
square<00:03:37.450> value<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.930> could<00:03:38.049> be<00:03:38.170> taller

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
square value it could be taller

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.380 
square value it could be taller
probably<00:03:39.400> that'd<00:03:39.579> be<00:03:39.670> taller<00:03:39.910> giving<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
probably that'd be taller giving the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.479 
probably that'd be taller giving the
amount<00:03:40.600> that's<00:03:40.750> in<00:03:40.900> there<00:03:41.110> but<00:03:41.860> they<00:03:42.160> do<00:03:42.220> well

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
amount that's in there but they do well

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.550 
amount that's in there but they do well
in<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.730> for<00:03:42.910> now<00:03:43.140> basically<00:03:44.140> when<00:03:44.230> they<00:03:44.350> molt

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
in that for now basically when they molt

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.470 
in that for now basically when they molt
they'll<00:03:44.709> drop<00:03:44.890> straight<00:03:45.220> out<00:03:45.519> like<00:03:46.209> any<00:03:46.390> other

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
they'll drop straight out like any other

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.940 
they'll drop straight out like any other
invert<00:03:46.930> from<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.320> bottom<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.620> leaves<00:03:47.799> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
invert from the bottom of the leaves I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.069 
invert from the bottom of the leaves I
need<00:03:48.100> space<00:03:48.340> for<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.730> as<00:03:49.600> they<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:49.900> bigger

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
need space for that as they get bigger

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.110 
need space for that as they get bigger
they<00:03:50.320> will<00:03:50.530> be<00:03:50.680> upgraded<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.549> much<00:03:51.940> larger

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
they will be upgraded to a much larger

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.509 
they will be upgraded to a much larger
enclosure<00:03:52.660> which<00:03:52.930> I'm<00:03:53.110> yet<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.350> build<00:03:53.680> I

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
enclosure which I'm yet to build I

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.180 
enclosure which I'm yet to build I
probably<00:03:55.090> use<00:03:55.269> basically<00:03:55.570> things<00:03:56.049> like<00:03:56.290> MDF

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
probably use basically things like MDF

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.300 
probably use basically things like MDF
or<00:03:57.280> plywood<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.390> some<00:03:58.480> insect<00:03:58.840> mesh

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
or plywood and just some insect mesh

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.920 
or plywood and just some insect mesh
staple<00:04:00.310> going<00:04:00.430> all<00:04:00.700> around<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.120> like<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.720> nice

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
staple going all around it like a nice

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.270 
staple going all around it like a nice
big<00:04:02.109> one<00:04:02.290> it'll<00:04:02.470> be<00:04:02.530> pretty<00:04:02.709> awesome<00:04:02.920> now

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
big one it'll be pretty awesome now

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.830 
big one it'll be pretty awesome now
definitely<00:04:03.970> show<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.269> video<00:04:04.420> when<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.690> do

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
definitely show you a video when I do

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.830 
definitely show you a video when I do
that

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.020

the very very very fragile I can't
stress<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.190> enough

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
stress that enough

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
if you go and pick one up you'll rip the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.310 
if you go and pick one up you'll rip the
legs<00:04:14.830> off<00:04:15.099> if<00:04:15.640> one's<00:04:16.000> half<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:16.810> your<00:04:16.959> hand<00:04:17.109> and

you<00:04:17.410> decide<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.100> lift<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.489> you'll<00:04:18.639> rip<00:04:18.820> his

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
you decide to lift it you'll rip his

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.150 
you decide to lift it you'll rip his
legs<00:04:19.180> off<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.840> literally<00:04:20.109> have<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.500> put<00:04:21.040> your

legs off you literally have to put your
hand<00:04:21.340> near<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.850> it'll<00:04:22.330> probably<00:04:22.419> reach<00:04:22.750> out

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
hand near it it'll probably reach out

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.890 
hand near it it'll probably reach out
it'll<00:04:24.100> put<00:04:24.280> its<00:04:24.400> front<00:04:24.820> legs<00:04:24.880> on<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.360> wait

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
it'll put its front legs on you wait

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.780 
it'll put its front legs on you wait
until<00:04:26.260> it's<00:04:26.410> got<00:04:26.590> all<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:27.160> them<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.370> before

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
until it's got all of them on before

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.310 
until it's got all of them on before
moving<00:04:28.030> your<00:04:28.150> hand<00:04:28.300> away<00:04:28.419> because<00:04:28.780> honestly

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
moving your hand away because honestly

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.050 
moving your hand away because honestly
you'll<00:04:29.560> rip<00:04:29.740> their<00:04:29.919> legs<00:04:30.070> off<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.550> easily

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
you'll rip their legs off so easily

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.810 
you'll rip their legs off so easily
they're<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.660> very<00:04:31.750> fragile<00:04:32.320> insect<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.950> set

hundreds<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.210> size<00:04:34.360> now<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.889> gotta<00:04:36.070> be

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
hundreds of size now so you gotta be

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.320 
hundreds of size now so you gotta be
really<00:04:36.370> careful<00:04:36.550> when<00:04:36.760> handling<00:04:36.910> them<00:04:39.210> sex<00:04:40.210> in

them<00:04:40.450> can<00:04:40.630> be<00:04:40.780> easier

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
them can be easier
