this<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.940> wouldn't<00:02:03.940> use<00:02:04.030> anything<00:02:04.240> else<00:02:04.420> so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
this and wouldn't use anything else so

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.609 
this and wouldn't use anything else so
let's<00:02:05.709> get<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.490> we're<00:02:07.000> gonna<00:02:07.090> need<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
let's get to it so we're gonna need the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.520 
let's get to it so we're gonna need the
Farfisa<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.670> USB<00:02:10.569> cable<00:02:11.049> let's<00:02:11.230> start<00:02:11.410> off

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
Farfisa and USB cable let's start off

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.860 
Farfisa and USB cable let's start off
with<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.709> we're<00:02:12.430> gonna<00:02:12.549> plug<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.090> here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
with that we're gonna plug it in here

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.150 
with that we're gonna plug it in here
you<00:02:14.590> speak<00:02:14.860> into<00:02:15.269> my<00:02:16.319> computer

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.980 

just<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.240> we<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.630> Farfisa

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
just like that so we have the Farfisa

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.220 
just like that so we have the Farfisa
connected<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.890> computer<00:02:24.700> now<00:02:25.050> next<00:02:26.050> we're

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
connected to the computer now next we're

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.660 
connected to the computer now next we're
gonna<00:02:26.290> take<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.800> TRS<00:02:28.260> cable<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.950> right<00:02:30.490> into

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
gonna take the TRS cable go right into

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.900 
gonna take the TRS cable go right into
the<00:02:30.940> Farfisa<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:33.580> we're<00:02:33.850> gonna

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the Farfisa like so then we're gonna

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.150 
the Farfisa like so then we're gonna
take<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.270> two<00:02:36.060> mono<00:02:37.060> cables<00:02:37.510> well<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
take the two mono cables well that's the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.940 
take the two mono cables well that's the
other<00:02:39.370> side<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.880> t<00:02:40.090> TRS<00:02:40.960> by<00:02:41.140> now<00:02:41.290> we're

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
other side of the t TRS by now we're

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.350 
other side of the t TRS by now we're
gonna<00:02:42.040> go<00:02:42.280> into<00:02:42.550> 9<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.720> 10<00:02:43.930> over<00:02:44.830> here<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.880> 9

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.760 
pin MIDI cable and we're going to go
from<00:02:56.980> behind<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.880> Farfisa<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.770> into

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
from behind the Farfisa like that into

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.970 
from behind the Farfisa like that into
the<00:03:03.070> MIDI<00:03:03.430> keyboard<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.630> that's<00:03:05.230> back<00:03:05.500> here
