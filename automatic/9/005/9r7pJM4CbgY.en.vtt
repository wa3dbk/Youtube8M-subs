00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.570 
and it'll pick up cars pick up people
and<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:18.520> eat<00:01:18.789> him

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.570 

it's<00:01:22.450> also<00:01:22.630> interactive<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.860> PK<00:01:24.550> a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
it's also interactive so you can PK a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.460 
it's also interactive so you can PK a
human<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.240> bring<00:01:25.510> it<00:01:25.630> near<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.870> tentacle<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.470 
right from and one of the really cool
weapons<00:01:33.220> we<00:01:33.340> have<00:01:33.430> is<00:01:33.580> called<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.970> black<00:01:34.180> hole

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
weapons we have is called the black hole

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.340 
weapons we have is called the black hole
gun

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 

he<00:01:40.770> could<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.189> generate<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.030> kind<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
he could not generate that kind of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.859 
he could not generate that kind of
physics<00:01:42.720> trauma<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.920> world<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.869> old

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
physics trauma to the world on old

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
physics trauma to the world on old
systems<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.240> fire<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
systems but now we can you just fire it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990 
systems but now we can you just fire it
off<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.320> huge<00:01:52.799> black<00:01:53.100> hole<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.580> rips
