splutter that exe and then let's see
find<00:05:03.099> this<00:05:03.250> line<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:04.080> also<00:05:05.080> add<00:05:05.199> columns<00:05:05.970> and

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
find this line and also add columns and

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.689 
find this line and also add columns and
then<00:05:09.039> below<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:09.370> line<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:10.870> want<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.320> add

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
then below that line you want to add

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.899 
then below that line you want to add
splutter<00:05:13.139> that<00:05:14.139> it's<00:05:14.380> e<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.490> let<00:05:15.520> me<00:05:15.760> explain

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
splutter that it's e so let me explain

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.520 
splutter that it's e so let me explain
what<00:05:16.150> these<00:05:16.300> lines<00:05:16.539> are<00:05:16.720> doing<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.110> case<00:05:17.260> you

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
what these lines are doing in case you

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.999 
what these lines are doing in case you
don't<00:05:17.770> understand<00:05:19.289> when<00:05:20.289> you<00:05:20.409> patch<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.830> game

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
don't understand when you patch the game

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.490 
don't understand when you patch the game
the<00:05:21.280> game<00:05:21.490> comes<00:05:21.759> with<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.000> file<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:23.199> should

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
the game comes with a file that should

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.800 
the game comes with a file that should
close<00:05:23.860> explorer<00:05:24.400> because<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:25.180> file<00:05:25.419> the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
close explorer because the file the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.379 
close explorer because the file the
program<00:05:26.020> exploder<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.880> causing<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:27.970> problems

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
program exploder is causing the problems

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.730 
program exploder is causing the problems
with<00:05:28.539> the<00:05:28.690> game<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:30.280> problem<00:05:30.580> is<00:05:30.639> that<00:05:30.849> this

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
with the game the problem is that this

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.010 
with the game the problem is that this
program<00:05:32.740> doesn't<00:05:32.979> work<00:05:33.130> right<00:05:34.120> for<00:05:34.870> some

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
program doesn't work right for some

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.490 
program doesn't work right for some
reason

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
reason

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.350 
reason
so<00:05:36.310> in

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
so in

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.719 
so in
of<00:05:37.539> using<00:05:37.810> their<00:05:37.990> program<00:05:38.349> you<00:05:38.470> can<00:05:38.620> use

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
of using their program you can use

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.070 
of using their program you can use
taskkill<00:05:39.729> which<00:05:39.939> is<00:05:40.090> a<00:05:40.270> command<00:05:40.659> that<00:05:40.780> comes

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
taskkill which is a command that comes

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.339 
taskkill which is a command that comes
with<00:05:41.259> Windows<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:42.479> then<00:05:43.479> this<00:05:43.960> will<00:05:44.169> close

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
with Windows and then this will close

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.140 
with Windows and then this will close
the<00:05:44.409> program<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.039> this<00:05:45.430> line<00:05:45.639> over<00:05:45.759> here<00:05:46.000> will

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
the program and this line over here will

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.790 
the program and this line over here will
open<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:48.569> so<00:05:49.569> hopefully<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:50.169> understand<00:05:50.590> if

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
open it so hopefully you understand if

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.920 
open it so hopefully you understand if
you<00:05:51.009> don't<00:05:51.310> trust<00:05:52.000> me<00:05:52.210> this<00:05:52.330> will<00:05:52.509> work<00:05:52.659> fine

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
you don't trust me this will work fine

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.670 
you don't trust me this will work fine
now<00:05:53.199> let's<00:05:54.069> save<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.580> changes<00:05:54.969> and<00:05:55.409> let's<00:05:56.409> see

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
now let's save the changes and let's see

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.339 
now let's save the changes and let's see
and<00:05:57.060> now<00:05:58.060> we<00:05:58.120> should<00:05:58.270> be<00:05:58.419> able<00:05:58.509> to<00:05:58.810> play<00:05:58.990> and

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
and now we should be able to play and

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.249 
and now we should be able to play and
the<00:06:00.129> Conqueror's<00:06:00.610> at<00:06:00.789> full<00:06:01.000> resolution<00:06:01.259> it's

the Conqueror's at full resolution it's

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.839
