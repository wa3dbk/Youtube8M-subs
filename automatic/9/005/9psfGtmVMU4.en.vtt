00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.990
 The examining magistrate decided today that he was still in jail for fourteen days 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.520
 must remain the man suspected of serious mistreatment of a farmer who 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.899
 on the leidseplein 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.899
 bari reported to the police headquarters on Wednesday afternoon 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.699
 Badr Hari, for example, came to the head office in Amsterdam at around half past five 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.749
 the police on the marnixstraat 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.749
 according to her should disappear for a few extensive interrogations 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.929
 open the bomb on board 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.350
 The Netherlands sees that he is known as a great talent a champion one 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 american high end 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.640
 but there is not only praise 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.740
 twice he got this you will encounter good behavior 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
 the last time that moment 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.100
 that message that he has various artist in his face 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.620
 day later, balder decided to withdraw from the martial arts for the time being 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.050
 value what happen 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930
 nothing me 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.870
 i do believe that is that the check announced a month later in June 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.630
 the police are looking for walden 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.640
 they suspect him of a serious mistreatment of a doorman at the small 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.670
 gartman plant 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.930
 Earlier that year in February there is information that there may be one 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.399
 fighter is involved 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.130
 For months the police are looking for a macbook air in Morocco 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.670
 to sit 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.420
 and let nothing be heard 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.540
 something his manager Simon Rutz, who is talking about today, is not handy, he thinks 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.550
 knew he was wanted yes absolute director first and he blocked 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.510
 have to come 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.159
 I also think the club is just a little bit 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.890
 then that is not done 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.900

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.270
 sense 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.430
 The Amsterdam Arena is of course not ending well 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.420
 when he got this case i just wanna all a bit too much 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.370
 laws and day of those packs of planes I have a position 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.860
 the police now have three suspects for an abuse case 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.760
 arrested main suspect balde was missing 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.110
 so told now 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.690
 and with that a start can be made with a difficult case of which striking 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.140
 enough 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.139
 and no camera images are in a declaration 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.239
