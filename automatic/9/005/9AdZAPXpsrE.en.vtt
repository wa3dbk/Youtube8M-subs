00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
care of with these gestures so it'll be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.070 
care of with these gestures so it'll be
interesting<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> home<00:01:21.630> button<00:01:21.900> still

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
interesting if that home button still

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
interesting if that home button still
sticks<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> next<00:01:23.009> version<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
sticks around the next version of the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
sticks around the next version of the
ipad<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.509> inside<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> preferences<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
ipad so inside the preferences here you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
ipad so inside the preferences here you
have<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> option<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.400> turn<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
multitasking gestures so if you prefer

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.260 
multitasking gestures so if you prefer
not<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.909> still<00:01:30.119> use

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
not to have them you can just still use

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
not to have them you can just still use
the<00:01:30.420> home<00:01:30.600> button<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.650> an

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the home button up here is an

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069 
the home button up here is an
interesting<00:01:32.040> addition<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> side<00:01:33.659> switch

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
interesting addition for the side switch

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
interesting addition for the side switch
so<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.740> switch<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.340> here

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
so this is a little switch right here

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.240 
so this is a little switch right here
originally<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:37.290> rotation<00:01:37.829> lock<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
originally it was a rotation lock and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
then in iOS 4.2 it turned into a mute

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
then in iOS 4.2 it turned into a mute
