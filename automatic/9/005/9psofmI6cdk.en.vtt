00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.130
 well let's make some candies 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.600
 honey let's have a few more 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.300
 nothing for you to see how they are made 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.090
 and if you like them then catch and without 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.410
 duplicate triplicate the quantities well 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.820
 let's use 100 grams of liquid cream 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.430
 90 sugar 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.330
 15 grams of butter 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.580
 and two tablespoons of honey 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 in a mold where we will throw then 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.700
 our dough to cool and now the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.100
 shape of the squares but good 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.140
 They will be soft sweets, so 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 when they cool, you can also catch and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.900
 make it form then you who 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.840
 you want 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.990
 well this is all 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.420
 then a pot where we will introduce 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.840
 all the ingredients and we will not stop 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.840
 stir 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.160
 and well mixed until it looks like a 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.630
 pasta 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 well let's start throwing 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.109
 our beloved 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.109
 100 grams of cream 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.899
 then we throw our sugar 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.880
 two tablespoons of honey 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 once 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.310
 and 2 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 we resorted to the spoon 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.619
 all right 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.729
 and finally our 15 grams of the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.590
 butter and ready there's nothing more than 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:07.030
 do now already on a slow fire patience and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.470
 constantly stirring never stop 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.960
 stir 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.580
 the only thing to achieve is to evaporate the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.490
 liquid 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.890
 and that yes against more pastures or we have 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.890
 harder will be the candies 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.850
 if you want you can try to take some with 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.650
 this texture and others follow with the fire 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.820
 and then you will see the difference of how they are 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.820
 ones and how are others 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.480
 I have this texture I get everything 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.989
 next I'm going to put out the fire 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.790
 is going to be picking up a spoon to help me 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.790
 to put it in my mold 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.120
 We take a teaspoon a spoon 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.120
 coffee or whatever you want 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.980
 and we are going to introduce 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.200
 she is patience 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.260
 as it gets cooler it will be more doughy 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.260
 for the most liquid 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.709
 I just had an idea I'm going to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.830
 try a jar to see if it's more 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.830
 easy 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.660
 of picked a jar and while it's 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.700
 hot let's see if that's how it turns out 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.379
 easier or 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.370
 is expected to cool assured that no 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.370
 because there is a mass 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.510
 until it works well 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.510
 with slowly 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.069
 we went to the other hole 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.350
 we go to the other one that smears a bit but 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.350
 at least easier 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.380
 or simply it is for you to see how it 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.260
 they make the candies after I've said the 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.550
 amount you want if you want 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.720
 more quantity then double and triple 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.700
 the amounts 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.870
 if instead of honey you want coffee 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.870
 instead of honey or coffee 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.500
 it's simply the way to make them 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.699
 we already see that the beyond costs to lower 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.699
 every time it hardens more 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.620
 and this is the system until 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.450
 our molds full of candy 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.650
 once the candies cool us too 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.920
 you can putting the refrigerator if 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.360
 you want an imacec if it is stretching 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.220
 your mold assuming it's from 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.220
 silicone you can put it on the walls 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.480
 viewed 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.620
 the one for you 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.620
 here we have another 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.480
 other 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.600
 as you see, they go out alone 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.360
 cool cane soon and five minutes to the 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.360
 refrigerator 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.040
 for nothing today we would have a sample 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.390
 of our honey candies 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.230
 you can 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.230
 and we have them 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.870
 same 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.020
 the only thing that exposes for lack is to put 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.770
 it sounds from the mouth 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.770
 and good profit 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.020
 I hope that you
