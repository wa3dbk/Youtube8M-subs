00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
think one interesting thing to do is to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
think one interesting thing to do is to
take<00:02:03.869> those<00:02:04.079> two<00:02:04.320> tiers<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> look<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:05.100> they

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
take those two tiers and look how they

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.660 
take those two tiers and look how they
compare<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.270> randgold<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.439> price<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.890> its
