00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
come back and we're going to move them

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.760 
come back and we're going to move them
around<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.539> little<00:04:43.570> bit<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.320> help<00:04:44.440> with<00:04:44.680> the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
around a little bit to help with the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.420 
around a little bit to help with the
fermentation<00:04:45.130> process<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:47.190> we're<00:04:48.190> going<00:04:48.370> to

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
fermentation process and we're going to

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.980 
fermentation process and we're going to
cover<00:04:48.610> them<00:04:48.849> in<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.090> banana<00:04:49.330> leaves<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.870> we

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
cover them in the banana leaves that we

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.170 
cover them in the banana leaves that we
have<00:04:50.169> here<00:04:50.440> from<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.710> garden<00:04:51.099> and<00:04:51.280> then<00:04:52.090> we're

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
have here from the garden and then we're

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.670 
have here from the garden and then we're
going<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.330> wait<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.479> couple<00:04:52.570> more<00:04:53.080> days<00:04:53.320> to

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
going to wait a couple more days to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.330 
going to wait a couple more days to
allow<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.950> fermentation<00:04:54.700> process<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.900> happen

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
allow the fermentation process to happen

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.370 
allow the fermentation process to happen
and<00:04:57.340> for<00:04:58.270> these<00:04:58.360> type<00:04:58.599> seats<00:04:58.840> how<00:04:58.990> long<00:04:59.169> are<00:04:59.289> we

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
and for these type seats how long are we

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.150 
and for these type seats how long are we
thinking<00:04:59.680> on<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.979> fermentation<00:05:00.820> process

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
thinking on the fermentation process

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.700 
thinking on the fermentation process
yes<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.760> think<00:05:02.820> that's<00:05:03.120> good<00:05:03.780> cool<00:05:04.380> two<00:05:04.560> or

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
yes I think that's good cool two or

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.460 
yes I think that's good cool two or
three<00:05:04.740> days<00:05:05.540> they<00:05:06.540> say<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.080> longer<00:05:07.440> you

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
three days they say that the longer you

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.800 
three days they say that the longer you
ferment<00:05:07.920> it<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.310> richer<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.180> flavor<00:05:09.450> you'll

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
ferment it the richer of flavor you'll

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.590 
ferment it the richer of flavor you'll
get<00:05:10.250> but<00:05:11.250> we<00:05:11.340> don't<00:05:11.490> want<00:05:11.610> over<00:05:11.910> fine<00:05:12.150> Kate<00:05:12.450> it

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
get but we don't want over fine Kate it

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.570 
get but we don't want over fine Kate it
so<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.080> gets<00:05:13.590> moldy<00:05:13.860> or<00:05:14.190> anything<00:05:14.370> like

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
so that it gets moldy or anything like

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.050 
so that it gets moldy or anything like
that

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
that

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.380 
that
gotcha<00:05:15.900> oh<00:05:19.310> these<00:05:20.310> are<00:05:20.490> quite<00:05:20.610> interesting

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
gotcha oh these are quite interesting

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.440 
gotcha oh these are quite interesting
I<00:05:21.420> didn't<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:23.310> something<00:05:23.730> but<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:23.910> didn't

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
I didn't in something but I didn't

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.970 
I didn't in something but I didn't
expect<00:05:24.630> them<00:05:24.900> they<00:05:25.080> actually<00:05:25.200> look<00:05:25.560> almost

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
expect them they actually look almost

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.570 
expect them they actually look almost
like<00:05:26.130> little<00:05:26.450> cloves<00:05:27.450> of<00:05:27.630> garlic<00:05:28.050> okay

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.430 

but<00:05:32.580> now<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.760> white<00:05:33.030> substance<00:05:33.390> I<00:05:33.780> forgive<00:05:34.290> me

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
but now the white substance I forgive me

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.630 
but now the white substance I forgive me
I'm<00:05:34.560> pretty<00:05:34.740> ignorant<00:05:34.920> on<00:05:35.220> this<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.490> white

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
I'm pretty ignorant on this the white

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.740 
I'm pretty ignorant on this the white
substance<00:05:35.940> will<00:05:36.300> fall<00:05:36.840> away<00:05:37.020> yes<00:05:38.030> okay<00:05:39.030> dance

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
substance will fall away yes okay dance

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.600 
substance will fall away yes okay dance
and<00:05:40.050> it'll<00:05:40.230> help<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.620> flavor<00:05:40.860> of<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.370> bean

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
and it'll help the flavor of the bean

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.890 
and it'll help the flavor of the bean
Wow<00:05:42.240> look<00:05:42.510> at<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:43.160> so<00:05:44.160> beautiful<00:05:44.790> and<00:05:45.360> it

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
Wow look at that so beautiful and it

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.240 
Wow look at that so beautiful and it
will<00:05:46.050> ferment<00:05:46.500> and<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:49.110> then<00:05:49.590> when<00:05:49.800> we<00:05:49.980> draw

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
will ferment and and then when we draw

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.190 
will ferment and and then when we draw
it<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.730> drying<00:05:51.030> process<00:05:51.120> it'll<00:05:51.720> dry<00:05:51.960> and

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
it in the drying process it'll dry and

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.860 
it in the drying process it'll dry and
then<00:05:52.290> we'll<00:05:52.440> be<00:05:52.560> able<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.770> pick<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.460> off<00:05:53.700> of<00:05:53.970> the

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
then we'll be able to pick it off of the

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.770 
then we'll be able to pick it off of the
brown<00:05:55.170> beef<00:05:55.670> right<00:05:56.670> now<00:05:56.850> it's<00:05:57.060> quite<00:05:57.300> red<00:05:57.540> with

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
brown beef right now it's quite red with

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.900 
brown beef right now it's quite red with
my<00:05:57.810> slice<00:05:58.230> so<00:05:58.740> with<00:05:59.130> everything<00:05:59.430> we've<00:05:59.730> got

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
my slice so with everything we've got

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.760 
my slice so with everything we've got
here<00:06:00.150> we're<00:06:00.300> gonna<00:06:00.390> have<00:06:00.630> quite<00:06:00.990> a<00:06:01.050> yield<00:06:01.440> of<00:06:01.620> a

raw cacao right yeah I mean this is a
pretty<00:06:07.200> good<00:06:07.440> little<00:06:07.560> yield<00:06:07.950> these<00:06:08.580> but<00:06:08.910> we

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
pretty good little yield these but we

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.110 
pretty good little yield these but we
also<00:06:09.150> like<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.540> make<00:06:09.870> um<00:06:10.670> you<00:06:11.670> know<00:06:11.790> little

deliciousness<00:06:17.460> I'm<00:06:17.760> thinking<00:06:18.060> this<00:06:18.180> will<00:06:18.360> be

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
deliciousness I'm thinking this will be

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.890 
deliciousness I'm thinking this will be
good<00:06:18.750> with<00:06:19.740> coconut<00:06:20.430> and<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.150> food

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
good with coconut and the food

good with coconut and the food
dehydrator<00:06:22.530> when<00:06:22.800> we<00:06:22.890> get<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.100> food

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
dehydrator when we get the food

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:33.730 
dehydrator when we get the food
dehydrator<00:06:23.850> down<00:06:24.090> here

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.570 

but<00:06:34.550> here<00:06:34.729> see<00:06:34.969> I've<00:06:35.360> cut<00:06:35.629> one<00:06:35.840> of<00:06:35.990> these<00:06:36.110> open

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
but here see I've cut one of these open

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.200 
but here see I've cut one of these open
by<00:06:37.580> accident<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:39.580> you<00:06:40.580> see<00:06:40.789> it's<00:06:40.969> quite

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
by accident and you see it's quite

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.230
