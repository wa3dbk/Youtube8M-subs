 We will accept on this slope in 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 this message is going to open a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.040
 small window here to be able 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.650
 start with the installation now you 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.299
 you can come here this button activated 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.889
 how can they come deactivated as in 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.170
 my case we are going to click where it says 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.879
 configure the office setup here 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.730
 let's select the option that says 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.069
 office premium not the office 2013 but the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.959
 preview here select if the 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.900
 architecture of your computer is 34 is 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.120
 32 or 64 bits in my case 64 here we leave 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.739
 just as it is in the same way 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.329
 we leave as is and here below 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.819
 we are going to select the languages 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.109
 obviously in this case Spanish if you 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.849
 you want in English you can download it in 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.530
 English and in the section below 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.480
 you choose the additional language that you 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.459
 you want in my case I 'm marking the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.260
 additional language English and I click on 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.540
 install now now it's going to open this 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.459
 small window 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.489
 of the start of the installation as you see 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.439
 here you are configuring microsoft office 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.569
 2016 which in this case is the 2016 office 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.099
 this is going to take a moment since what 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.109
 what he's going to do now is the first 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.329
 prepare the equipment and then it will proceed 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.920
 the download and installation of the 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.450
 office package that in this case 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.040
 would be in the three programs before 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.470
 mentioned word excel and power point 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.849
 this takes some time and I'm going to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.859
 pause the video for a moment and then 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.049
 we will continue when it is 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.609
 finished and good friends as you will see the 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.859
 program is practically already 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.840
 finishing downloading and as you see here 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.569
 says office is installing in second 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.760
 flat 66% and the download goes to 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.049
 finish and once it's over we're going to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.750
 check that it has been downloaded 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.459
 completely and well this good already here 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.739
 he has practically finished loading 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.629
 now what he tells us here is that he still 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.709
 is installing the programs so what 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.109
 that we have to wait for this 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.780
 come I imagine 100% or in your 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.489
 defect that the message that is closing 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.840
 it just comes here says the interaction 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.549
 has finished the office product is 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.650
 completely installed now you can 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.209
 disconnecting or shutting down is asking me 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.819
 here is that 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.160
 turn off the computer I do not know why it will be 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:23.289
 well I think that I will do it well 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.400
 I'm going to restart the computer to 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.139
 avoid that can cause me some 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.630
 mistake and then we continue with the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.250
 tutorial and well I have already restarted the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.900
 computer 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.330
 Now what we are going to do is open the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.160
 program and we will notice that the program 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.349
 it's completely deactivated I'm going to 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.389
 open any program says here that 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.060
 I need to activate the office obviously 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.580
 is deactivated here this appears 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.199
 red band with the option to activate if 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.360
 we go to file account let's see 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.860
 what says activation needed now as 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.210
 we can solve this in this version 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.460
 previous good just close we're going 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.720
 here to the folder that says files 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.270
 remember that here were some 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.570
 files when I delete the others that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.289
 we were going to go into this folder 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.980
 what does it say 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.080
 preview now 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.350
 this yes just in case it gives you some error 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.880
 when you unzip this what you have to 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.800
 do is disable in the antivirus and 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.490
 with this program that is here 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.860
 in we are going to create the program by 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.210
 so saying it let's go to the section of 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.070
 down here and we're going to right click 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.450
 run as administrator and we're going 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.130
 to open the program for activation 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.050
 we click here in I accept we are going to 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.480
 uncheck this box here and we leave 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.670
 marked only the one that says 16 we give 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.560
 click here in active and this appears 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.660
 message to update this we give to 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.550
 click here we do not click here in active 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.130
 continue with activation if we wait 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.270
 a moment says that the activation of 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.860
 office 2016 beta pro plus we see that it is 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.300
 we have to wait and well here I 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.800
 it seems that the 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.860
 activation so I'm going to open a 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.900
 program over here I already have some I'm going to 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.020
 open the powerpoint now what are we going to 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.640
 note is that once we go to the 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.560
 account section I'm going to enter here 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.330
 a blank presentation any 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.710
 well this message seems to me for a 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.030
 plugin that I have installed of qantas 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.009
 since I'm going to give it ok but not what 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.050
 use 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.180
 file counts and if you notice 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.029
 here it says that it is already activated although 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.939
 here he tells us that he is the office 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:22.819
 professional plus 2013 this simply 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.379
 is an action that the activator does if 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.719
 you fix the video at the beginning 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:28.669
 we had here 2016 but this does the 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.110
 activator to perform the 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.889
 activation the program is still the 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.449
 same 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.779
 and even if we go here where it says 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.460
 about power point preview tells us 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.309
 which is the previous power point version or 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.559
 be the 2016 that is still the beta and good 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:44.360
 I hope the video has served you already 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.219
 they know the only thing they have to do to 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.259
