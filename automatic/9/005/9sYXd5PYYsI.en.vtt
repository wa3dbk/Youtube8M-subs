00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.870
 Welcome to the scenario metal 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.299
 video presentation today I show them 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.980
 as you visualize with our photo 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.500
 faster and easier in the customer 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.910
 matching offers to existing object 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.429
 can present 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.410
 the basic situation is in principle 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.359
 always the same they go out and 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.400
 customer next to take their measure 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.920
 digital camera with shooting from the house of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.750
 Customer a photo if you like this photo 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.849
 then open with thermometers that's yes 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.490
 mostly a jpeg or tiff format as 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.500
 foto file always opens directly 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.860
 An assistant that helps easily 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.620
 should 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.360
 this photo to measure the program 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.190
 at the first moment it was not what it was 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.129
 in the photo a meter what are 50 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.980
 centimeters 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.420
 this is simply a tick on 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 Do you want to measure the current sheet? 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.100
 click on continue to determine now 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.960
 I measured what I know I know 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.850
 example from the left knew until 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.359
 right to the masonry we have about 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.300
 a length of 3 meters seventy have that 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.000
 all measured and now I could 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.740
 in this example right here on the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.430
 stair railing module we are looking for 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.380
 a railing drove off my values 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.480
 hand I have my podium for 370 long 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.090
 is with three between posts click on 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.400
 ok have my land railing generated 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.320
 Just put it in the photo and 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.150
 Accordingly, the customer sees on 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.620
 own house for the terrain later acts 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.270
 I have the possibilities 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.460
 the agents serve, for example, away too 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.650
 switch and of course I can now 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.790
 very nice in the conversation just over 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.270
 Right mouse button, for example, change 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.470
 go back to input dialog have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.970
 her the possibility different 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.470
 to present railing types 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.850
 because there it is already going on that 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.110
 the customer does not know what is one 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.970
 cassettes filling what are between 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.310
 straps and so he can already there 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.200
 Imagine something below 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.890
 You can have a very nice discussion 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.450
 lead another example wants 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.560
 maybe a gate to the customer 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.060
 want to present 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.040
 Of course, the foundation is on again 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.850
 been shot photo that case this 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.500
 gateway 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.660
 I would like to measure one again 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.060
 this photo and now knows from the left 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.500
 to the right masonry we have one 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.149
 length of four meters 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.409
 click here as well on ok then goes 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.599
 for example, in your own 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.220
 library here the possibility you 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.470
 self- drawn gates element 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.659
 to pick out or even from the manufacturer 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.480
 integrate gates and fits here as well 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.939
 The gate is very beautiful again the photo 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.189
 and the customer can already 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.319
 really nice to imagine like that 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.260
 gate later at his entrance 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.189
 could 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.129
 Of course, the whole thing goes well 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.989
 About the known frame generator I 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.989
 look for my shoe out of it 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.420
 tip the parameters and can the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.970
 Customers so very fast and easy 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.590
 present different basic forms 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.970
 many of our customers are now driving 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.690
 Also very happy with the laptop 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.430
 customers out 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.739
 Of course that has two advantages to 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.909
 they have a nice one 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.930
 consultation and on the other 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.549
 The customer maybe I am directly on 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.200
 Offer in the hand with the man 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.689
 then maybe could go out every 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.400
 that can handle so elegant to have 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.780
 Another example of using a laptop 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.700
 seconds out before the terrain 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.900
 referred to the photo and now you can 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.519
 Of course they will talk again 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.290
 very nice different game elements 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.849
 so pay if the customer is told 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.739
 I do not like everything 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.139
 then of course I have the same 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.239
 possibility to mark the gate again 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.069
 maybe with the familiar function 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.799
 fill bars search my material 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:26.389
 out 12 and for example as a pool element and also 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.310
 here the values ​​are correct by the fact that 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.859
 the feed have been measured I have the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.989
 Real distance of 80 to 120 mm as 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.699
 light measure click on the area you 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.409
 I want to feel and can do so to the customer 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.970
 maybe different early elements 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.310
 pay more or in this case again 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.530
 before after picture also from one 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.049
 Colleague poses left is this 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.750
 model so the offer and right 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.739
 the following picture after assembly 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.430
 special here is the battery of the 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.959
 bent 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.079
 But the customer can ever before 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.169
 see very nicely fits iquadrat hole 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.190
 adjusts the color of the plate to hauswand 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.989
 maybe the picture after the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.720
 montage except you hardly see one 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.280
 We differed as a last example 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.199
 maybe another conceivable one 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.329
 they could do it again before 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.810
 after that picture that is of course now that 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.669
 model as you can see clearly 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.099
 slightly in need of renovation and now 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.269
 the picture comes after the editing and 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.040
 as I said there it is now for the first time 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.840
 once just about the customer 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.160
 he should present himself 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.480
 can imagine 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.650
 and so looks really ever 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.720
 previously shown a bit spatially 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.410
 like a researcher about counterpart with them 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.420
 can work 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.460
 and especially the supply phase is always 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.800
 must save a phased over time the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.660
 but still very time consuming with 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.520
 the photo visualization of teno metal 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.440
 save a lot of time in the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.260
 However, the customer can offer a quotation phase 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.760
 nevertheless objectively something at the own house 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.040
 show that it is actually the 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.750
 The point can be that simple 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.740
 his 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.290
 Call me if you ask 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.950
 on metal they have and remain 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.360
 Up to date 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.520
 our newsletter right on the internet 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.890
 you can sign up to many 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.880
 thanks for your attention and until the

 next video presentation
