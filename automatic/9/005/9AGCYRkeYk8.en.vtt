water<00:05:44.919> and<00:05:45.160> sweat<00:05:45.430> resistant<00:05:45.940> the

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
water and sweat resistant the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.730 
water and sweat resistant the
engineering<00:05:46.600> team<00:05:46.750> redesigned<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:47.560> way

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
engineering team redesigned it this way

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.200 
engineering team redesigned it this way
after<00:05:47.890> hearing<00:05:48.220> comments<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.760> previous

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
after hearing comments the previous

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.940 
after hearing comments the previous
model<00:05:49.539> could<00:05:49.750> not<00:05:49.930> withstand<00:05:50.169> sweat<00:05:50.770> and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
model could not withstand sweat and

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.350 
model could not withstand sweat and
moisture<00:05:51.070> from<00:05:51.430> hard<00:05:51.640> workouts<00:05:52.030> so<00:05:52.210> that's

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
moisture from hard workouts so that's

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.770 
moisture from hard workouts so that's
awesome

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
awesome

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.540 
awesome
so<00:05:53.350> now<00:05:53.470> you<00:05:53.530> know<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:53.770> when<00:05:54.220> you<00:05:54.370> leave

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
so now you know that when you leave

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.940 
so now you know that when you leave
comments<00:05:55.120> on<00:05:55.270> Sony's<00:05:55.720> sites<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.410> does<00:05:56.650> pay<00:05:56.919> off

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
comments on Sony's sites it does pay off

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.260 
comments on Sony's sites it does pay off
