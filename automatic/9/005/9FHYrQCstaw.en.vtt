screen in this main view we also have

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.210 
screen in this main view we also have
pitch<00:01:23.110> control<00:01:23.560> over<00:01:23.830> each<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.130> the

oscillators

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.469 

you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.080 

and<00:01:37.020> even<00:01:37.259> teaching<00:01:37.590> them

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.889 

if<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.210> need<00:01:45.420> envelope<00:01:46.260> control

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.260 

attack<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.009> release<00:01:52.250> are<00:01:52.429> there<00:01:52.579> as<00:01:52.729> well<00:01:53.179> as

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
attack and release are there as well as

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.569 
attack and release are there as well as
effects<00:01:53.600> control<00:01:54.079> other<00:01:54.619> things<00:01:54.950> like<00:01:55.130> legato

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
effects control other things like legato

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:08.029 
effects control other things like legato
and<00:01:55.700> portamento<00:01:56.149> modes

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.620 

so<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.190> makes<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.550> very<00:02:09.640> easy<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.360> manipulate

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
so it makes it very easy to manipulate

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.110 
so it makes it very easy to manipulate
multiple<00:02:11.170> parameters<00:02:12.010> at<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.160> same<00:02:12.489> time<00:02:12.849> on
