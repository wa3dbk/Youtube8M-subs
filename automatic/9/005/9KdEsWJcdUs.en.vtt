00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.940 
that for last I'm gonna get this clay
ready<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.950> way<00:03:44.950> back<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.580> second

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.500 

as<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:50.180> know<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:51.080> little<00:03:51.290> bird<00:03:51.530> has<00:03:52.150> like<00:03:53.150> his

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
as you know the little bird has like his

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.780 
as you know the little bird has like his
stomach<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.200> little<00:03:54.530> white<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:55.099> just<00:03:55.370> get<00:03:55.760> a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
stomach is a little white so just get a

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.520 
stomach is a little white so just get a
little<00:03:56.030> bit<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.239> clay<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.290> even

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
little bit of clay like that and even

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.130 
little bit of clay like that and even
that<00:03:57.650> might<00:03:58.129> be<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.340> little<00:03:58.550> too<00:03:58.670> much<00:03:58.930> flat<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
that might be a little too much flat it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.059 
that might be a little too much flat it
down<00:04:01.480> simply<00:04:02.480> simply<00:04:03.260> by<00:04:03.470> just<00:04:03.500> kind<00:04:03.980> of

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
down simply simply by just kind of

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.270 
down simply simply by just kind of
pressing<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.730> down<00:04:04.760> like<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.390> very<00:04:05.900> simple

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
pressing it down like that very simple

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.750 
pressing it down like that very simple
but<00:04:07.280> leave<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.700> little<00:04:07.880> top<00:04:08.239> up<00:04:08.269> like<00:04:08.780> okay<00:04:09.760> like

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
but leave a little top up like okay like

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:20.259 
but leave a little top up like okay like
so<00:04:17.200> an<00:04:18.200> easier<00:04:18.709> way<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.669> probably<00:04:20.000> just<00:04:20.150> to

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
so an easier way it's probably just to

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.650 
so an easier way it's probably just to
do<00:04:20.419> this<00:04:22.630> get<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> little<00:04:24.280> like<00:04:25.479> probably<00:04:26.479> not

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
do this get a little like probably not

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.930 
do this get a little like probably not
even<00:04:26.960> this<00:04:27.260> much<00:04:27.320> mate<00:04:28.070> yeah<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.370> think<00:04:28.639> this<00:04:28.880> is

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
even this much mate yeah I think this is

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.360 
even this much mate yeah I think this is
perfect<00:04:29.590> put<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.770> on<00:04:30.979> there<00:04:31.340> like<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.919> but

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
perfect put it on there like that but

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.460 
perfect put it on there like that but
kind<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.180> lower<00:04:36.020> this<00:04:36.620> down<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:37.669> part<00:04:38.030> there

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
kind of lower this down that part there

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.409 
kind of lower this down that part there
yeah<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:39.650> kind<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.860> hard<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.190> do<00:04:40.340> now<00:04:40.580> like

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
yeah it's kind of hard to do now like

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.210 
yeah it's kind of hard to do now like
that<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:43.250> then<00:04:43.370> he<00:04:43.490> has<00:04:43.669> like<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:45.010> stomach<00:04:46.010> and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
that and then he has like a stomach and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.450 
that and then he has like a stomach and
if<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.790> kind<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.360> slide<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.560> on<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:49.160> the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
if you can kind of slide it on to the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.640 
if you can kind of slide it on to the
bottom<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:52.030> little<00:04:53.030> bit<00:04:53.180> like<00:04:53.389> that<00:04:53.530> if<00:04:54.530> you

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
bottom a little bit like that if you

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.080 
bottom a little bit like that if you
have<00:04:54.740> any<00:04:54.919> little<00:04:55.220> space<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.760> need<00:04:55.970> to
