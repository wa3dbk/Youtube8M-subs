00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.230
 so hello and welcome to our new one 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:28.150
 video to grow a new video of the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.580
 new xperia arc from sony this time 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.370
 do I grow this video with the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.460
 iphone 5 since I have my camera at home 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.409
 I hope I forgot that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.920
 quality then enough good is the 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.329
 packaging from the sony I like 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.520
 now not again 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.270
 because just not whether the packaging 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.079
 should its present device recognizable 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:02.199
 the yellow p is from us or if the 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:08.800
 packaging generally so inferior so 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:16.929
 what we like here is a data cable 1 220 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:23.110
 volt adapter usb manuals 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:26.440
 handbook battery and somewhere here then 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.090
 hiding the phone is watching you 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.090
 to get that without anything 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 I 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.650
 here come out of the cell phone if it is 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:08.149
 So the packaging would like to get along 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.630
 a catastrophe so now is the thing 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.630
 empty 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.940
 then we'll wait for the first one 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.100
 turn on 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.950
 now you have to on the files 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.970
 will lay if I find out the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.970
 can take the way back 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.519
 a recess or the like 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.420
 well solved 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.680
 what is the effort here is the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.440
 backside is completely chromed 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.450
 which then certainly a relative 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.600
 bad on receiving the new 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:06.970
 but Sony should give security 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.970
 have been thinking something I just hope 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.340
 the modern, the film of the camera 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.730
 turn the device on 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:57.219
 so if was much slower than 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.219
 like the hd htc models 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.530
 Get german language here 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.770
 the configuration menu became now 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:26.060
 completely skipped over whatsoever 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.010
 People's devices mostly have music 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.940
 on the device, let's see if you are 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.940
 music sad 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.270
 such a short review a short unboxing 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.790
 say again 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.510
 Thanks for watching until the 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.510
 next video
