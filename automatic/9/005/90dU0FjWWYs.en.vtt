let's<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> look<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.510> dmx<00:00:10.019> functions

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
let's have a look at the dmx functions

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.939 
let's have a look at the dmx functions
pen<00:00:12.690> em<00:00:13.620> fields<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.670> channel<00:00:15.030> 125<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:16.260> one

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
is pen to is 10 16 b 3 is tilt for is

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.120 
is pen to is 10 16 b 3 is tilt for is
toots<00:00:23.699> 16-bit<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.869> five<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.740> vector<00:00:26.099> speed

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
toots 16-bit and five is vector speed

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.200 
toots 16-bit and five is vector speed
the<00:00:29.130> chain<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> six<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.380> stroke<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.679> shutter

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
the chain of six is stroke and shutter

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.860 
the chain of six is stroke and shutter
so<00:00:33.210> let's<00:00:33.570> open<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.079> shutter<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.809> go<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so let's open the shutter and go to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
so let's open the shutter and go to
seven<00:00:37.579> channel<00:00:38.579> 7<00:00:38.879> 8<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.510> 9<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.530> our<00:00:40.950> TV

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
seven channel 7 8 and 9 is for our TV

seven channel 7 8 and 9 is for our TV
Deema<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.940> let's<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:43.320> color<00:00:43.649> red<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> channel

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
Deema so let's get color red in channel

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.930 
Deema so let's get color red in channel
7<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.129> have<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> look<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> movements

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.470 

to<00:00:55.480> this<00:00:55.660> panna<00:00:55.960> tools

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.960 

you<00:01:02.870> can<00:01:03.079> adjust<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.620> speed<00:01:03.890> by<00:01:04.220> using

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
you can adjust the speed by using

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:13.630 
you can adjust the speed by using
channel<00:01:05.269> 5<00:01:06.940> slower

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.010 

ok

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
ok

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.660 
ok
as<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.100> said<00:01:17.399> channel<00:01:18.030> 7<00:01:18.390> 8<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.810> 9<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.289> for

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
as we just said channel 7 8 and 9 is for

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
as we just said channel 7 8 and 9 is for
Dima<00:01:22.429> now<00:01:23.429> let's<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.789> look<00:01:24.329> at<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> colors

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
Dima now let's have a look at the colors

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:51.610 
Dima now let's have a look at the colors
and<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> Gorbals<00:01:26.490> now

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.550 

so<00:01:52.190> now<00:01:52.340> he's<00:01:52.580> got<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.820> bubble<00:01:53.660> shake<00:01:56.350> pink<00:01:57.350> opal

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
so now he's got a bubble shake pink opal

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:06.310 
so now he's got a bubble shake pink opal
is<00:01:57.980> in<00:01:58.370> channel<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:03.020> channel<00:02:03.730> 13<00:02:05.140> let's<00:02:06.140> get

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
is in channel is in channel 13 let's get

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.170 
is in channel is in channel 13 let's get

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
rid of the gobble go back for chem 7 is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:20.440 
rid of the gobble go back for chem 7 is
red<00:02:12.040> with<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.160> red<00:02:13.370> tema

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
this is a 15 volts tricolor evidene and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:42.230 
this is a 15 volts tricolor evidene and
then<00:02:26.030> H<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:28.420> Loup<00:02:29.420> de<00:02:29.629> Mer

very ate was random
neither<00:02:48.910> blue

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.160 

ok

Pinchot<00:03:08.950> 6<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.819> strokes<00:03:10.650> let's<00:03:11.650> get<00:03:11.890> some

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.910 

me<00:03:15.830> read<00:03:16.040> stroke

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
me read stroke

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:27.500 
me read stroke
06<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.430> bit

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.440 

so<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.140> see<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.590> initial<00:03:29.069> part<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.400> 1006<00:03:29.730> also

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
so you see the initial part of 1006 also

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.289 
so you see the initial part of 1006 also
have<00:03:30.629> some<00:03:30.959> kind<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.200> demon<00:03:31.439> pack<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.879> then

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
have some kind of demon pack and then

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.220 
have some kind of demon pack and then
stroke<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.939> all<00:03:35.939> the<00:03:36.209> way<00:03:36.329> up<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.780> shutter

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
stroke and all the way up is shutter

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.289 
stroke and all the way up is shutter
open<00:03:37.590> again<00:03:42.650> there's<00:03:43.650> seven<00:03:44.640> eight<00:03:44.760> nine<00:03:44.790> and

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
open again there's seven eight nine and

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.449 
open again there's seven eight nine and
channel<00:03:45.870> chain<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.319> metals<00:03:49.190> different<00:03:50.190> color

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
channel chain is metals different color

00:03:50.459 --> 00:04:01.020 
channel chain is metals different color
micros

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.740 

and<00:04:01.600> channel<00:04:01.930> 11<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.800> for<00:04:03.340> speed<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.450> color

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
and channel 11 is for speed of color

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.000 
and channel 11 is for speed of color
rotations<00:04:06.780> from<00:04:07.780> fast<00:04:08.530> too<00:04:08.800> slow<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.800> let's

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
rotations from fast too slow so let's

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.300 
rotations from fast too slow so let's
first<00:04:12.750> get<00:04:13.750> slowed<00:04:14.020> it<00:04:14.200> down<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.709> push<00:04:15.100> the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
first get slowed it down and push the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.930 
first get slowed it down and push the
fader<00:04:15.790> 11<00:04:16.269> up

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.760 

see<00:04:22.480> those<00:04:22.630> are<00:04:22.690> no<00:04:23.200> fitting<00:04:23.860> effective

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.600 

the<00:04:27.310> next<00:04:27.610> channel<00:04:27.819> we<00:04:27.910> channel<00:04:28.240> 12<00:04:29.610> Jellico

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
the next channel we channel 12 Jellico

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.740 
the next channel we channel 12 Jellico
the<00:04:31.120> first<00:04:31.720> part<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.500> sound<00:04:32.860> active<00:04:33.310> mode

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
the first part is the sound active mode

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.320 
the first part is the sound active mode
and<00:04:34.750> then<00:04:34.900> goes<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.470> sell<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:36.009> kilo<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
and then goes to sell a kilo then the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.320 
and then goes to sell a kilo then the
second<00:04:37.659> part<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.080> automotive

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330
