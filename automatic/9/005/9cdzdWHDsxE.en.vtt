 things that we took then these 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 things we put in the box we pack 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.289
 stick them on stickers 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.270
 we make inventories and when large 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.220
 the amount of cargo we accumulate is all 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.970
 send the case in Rostov 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 and from Rostov cargo goes to the southeast 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.790
 how actively do people respond to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.200
 call 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 Well, I think you can see for yourself 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 how actively they respond to my 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 look actively here about 4 cubic meters in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.900
 humanitarian aid plus everything else I 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.030
 would like to point out that some people to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
 we come not for the first time they come 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.170
 for the second and third time and brings 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 dear things for which many thanks to them 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.829
 Immediately in sight that people really 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.070
 very worried about the situation which 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.950
 exists in the southeast of Ukraine and they 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 ready to go to big expenses in order 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670
 so you only help those people who 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.860
 are now in the southeast 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.720
 as I understand more often to the call for 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.360
 help responding individuals they 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.979
 organizations true at the moment 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.719
 the company participates less but we hope 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.020
 that in the near future they will be 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.909
 much more because literally 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.469
 a few days ago we started such 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.479
 active calling organizations 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.149
 commercial and i really hope that this 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.090
 will give its result 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.340
 what kind of things do people most often bring here 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.739
 let's look at those statements 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.090
 which we made up 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.090
 because now lies in these boxes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.799
 here let's say 1 sheet practically 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.510
 totally dedicated to dress it with us 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.439
 berets i wish me thing bags 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.909
 flasks camouflage linings for pea jackets and 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.930
 much more 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.060
 then go food oil 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.920
 refined oatmeal sugar 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.620
 flakes 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.530
 there is also here a large number 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.010
 medical supplies soon 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.939
 time i think you will see a reportage with 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.010
 the other side of the border where you detail 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.170
 will show that the cargo came so that no one 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.260
 doubted that everyone knew exactly what 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.269
 the essence of the time sends is not easy 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.780
 somewhere in the black hole a load 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.599
 really as intended as well as me 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.310
 I urge all who have not come yet 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.590
 brought humanitarian aid 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.790
 still think maybe 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 need to do it
