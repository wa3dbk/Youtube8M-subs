00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 Wind tunnel race and the tunnel of the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.230
 wind I think 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.650
 or potential has to appear in 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.650
 twitter 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.860
 efe had to put it with an image in 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.100
 twitter with piggy bank or liked quality 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.460
 they tell me because he says he heard that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.520
 we are and weird weird words that 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.820
 we made it worth around here now very first 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.290
 it's very first with three laps it's not going 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.300
 to put a spin because it was very little 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.890
 but three laps it's pretty cool 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.750
 worth up here cuidadín cuidadín 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.979
 It goes up well well well well well 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.509
 and now the looking this doubled challenge 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.680
 stand upright right perfect perfect 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.899
 we go in first position with a lot 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 advantage we bring you much advantage by 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.530
 here perfect 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.670
 I have some live latinas vice furis de 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.189
 A level of English is lousy I know 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.740
 that I especially have, I'm happy and I 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.329
 like to entertain subscribers is 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.700
 you have to have a good time, you have to 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.130
 have a good time and be 100 every day 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 you have to try to be happy it's worth that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.179
 it's okay because the problems come alone and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 if we are always with problems that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.349
 they say that if I have to, if I go 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 always happy to always be good 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.940
 the cope is a godoy concept always to 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.040
 top with conventional 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.780
 this third looping and we will see why 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.540
 the third one never worked out for me but I've 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.519
 done this up 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.280
 worth it worth friends worth stand upright 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.810
 rector well well calm and quiet 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.610
 that the last door is left and I think that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190
 I'm going to take a few laps of advantage 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.290
 last lap advantage to the last of 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.170

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.580
 and quiet calm, get so serious 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.270
 that after the action and the miniature 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.270
 and then 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.210
 give him quiet fury calm 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.210
 quiet 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.450
 my important super ethical story 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.790
 impossible 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.220
 it's pretty cool pretty good like having 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.530
 the race lasted just 3 minutes 34 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.540
 minutes and it's cool because the truth 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.980
 that a wind tunnel left me ' 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.690
 having now come up here for the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.680
 looping and you have to enter here 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.740
 after doing a nice plane and jumping 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.730
 towards one of theft by the middle one 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.990
 perfect 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.910

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.690
 you know live favorite share it with 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.070

 it is very easy to get to a thousand like 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.120
 because the truth that you can see more 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.280
 behind this you really like to see 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.760

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.099
 I can put the focus a little bit more here 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.560

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.269
