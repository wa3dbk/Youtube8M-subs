00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
gives using some subhash numbers that's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.299 
gives using some subhash numbers that's
not<00:00:52.199> always<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:52.980> machine<00:00:53.100> so

here<00:01:45.580> let's<00:01:46.580> start<00:01:46.670> buying<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.330> that'd<00:01:48.290> be<00:01:48.610> six

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
here let's start buying so that'd be six

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:00.060 
here let's start buying so that'd be six
seven<00:01:51.460> eight<00:01:53.080> nine<00:01:56.320> ten<00:01:57.850> eleven<00:01:58.850> twelve

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.980 
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:02.150> bear<00:02:02.300> in<00:02:02.330> mind<00:02:02.480> that<00:02:02.570> currently

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
thirteen so bear in mind that currently

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.690 
thirteen so bear in mind that currently
in<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.140> game<00:02:03.230> you<00:02:03.410> can<00:02:03.440> only<00:02:03.560> have<00:02:03.860> nine<00:02:04.520> of

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
in the game you can only have nine of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.100 
in the game you can only have nine of
these<00:02:04.790> plots<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.210> think<00:02:05.360> that's<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.630> fairly

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
these plots and I think that's a fairly

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.540 
these plots and I think that's a fairly
good<00:02:06.260> limitation<00:02:06.800> considering<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
good limitation considering that the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.310 
good limitation considering that the
game<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:07.940> get<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.390> little<00:02:08.690> bit<00:02:08.869> slow<00:02:09.110> if<00:02:09.229> you

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
game can get a little bit slow if you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.090 
game can get a little bit slow if you
fill<00:02:09.590> up<00:02:09.679> all<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.979> these<00:02:10.070> slots<00:02:11.950> which<00:02:12.950> isn't

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
fill up all of these slots which isn't

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.650 
fill up all of these slots which isn't
anything<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.490> say<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.700> know<00:02:14.000> bad<00:02:14.300> about<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
anything to say you know bad about the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.340 
anything to say you know bad about the
game<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.590> well<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:18.170> are

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
game it's just that well there are

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.020 
game it's just that well there are
technical<00:02:18.650> limitations<00:02:19.190> for<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.370> reason<00:02:19.760> and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
technical limitations for a reason and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.150 
technical limitations for a reason and
is<00:02:20.210> kind<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.810> big<00:02:21.050> simulation<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.800> run<00:02:21.980> so

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
is kind of a big simulation to run so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.530 
is kind of a big simulation to run so
there<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.400> go<00:02:22.430> unlock<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.820> entire<00:02:23.090> town<00:02:23.270> so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
there we go unlock the entire town so

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.420 
there we go unlock the entire town so
from<00:02:23.750> having<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.170> reasonably<00:02:24.650> sized<00:02:24.890> town<00:02:25.250> over

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
from having a reasonably sized town over

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.250 
from having a reasonably sized town over
there<00:02:25.520> that's<00:02:25.700> taking<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.870> know<00:02:26.900> five

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
there that's taking up you know five

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.630 
there that's taking up you know five
Charles<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.890> wasn't<00:02:28.100> really<00:02:28.250> fun<00:02:28.370> taking<00:02:28.580> up

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640
