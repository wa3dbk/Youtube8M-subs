00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
up and what looks like an uncirculated

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
up and what looks like an uncirculated
roll<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.990> 2014<00:01:46.579> except<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.720> really

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
roll of 2014 except for is just really

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.280 
roll of 2014 except for is just really
odd<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.960> new

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
odd that one there and then this new

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.910 
odd that one there and then this new
where<00:01:52.470> zinc<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.689> 1961<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> it's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
where zinc one and then a 1961 so it's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
where zinc one and then a 1961 so it's
just<00:01:56.040> weird<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.399> these<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.820> all<00:01:57.060> completely

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
just weird like these are all completely

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.069 
just weird like these are all completely
uncirculated<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.799> tell<00:01:59.780> except<00:02:00.780> for

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
uncirculated you can tell except for

around<00:02:20.450> see<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.469> data<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:23.079> 1945<00:02:24.079> there

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:24.499 
around see what the data is 1945 there

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.530 
around see what the data is 1945 there
you<00:02:24.650> go

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
you go

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.289 
you go
okay<00:02:26.540> we're<00:02:26.810> here<00:02:26.959> for<00:02:27.109> the<00:02:27.200> wrap-up<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> let's

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
okay we're here for the wrap-up so let's

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.229 
okay we're here for the wrap-up so let's
see<00:02:29.719> here<00:02:30.139> are<00:02:30.469> the<00:02:31.459> end<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:31.939> pennies

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.009 
see here are the end of the pennies
those<00:02:32.659> are<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.170> 60<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.859> the<00:02:34.010> 70s<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.669> the<00:02:34.730> 80s

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.420 
those are the 60 is the 70s and the 80s
actually<00:02:36.019> put<00:02:36.409> them<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.709> box<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:37.219> save

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
actually put them in that box to save

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.879 
actually put them in that box to save
some<00:02:37.639> space<00:02:37.669> I<00:02:38.299> thought<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:38.659> was<00:02:38.749> a<00:02:38.780> good<00:02:39.650> idea

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
some space I thought it was a good idea

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.819 
some space I thought it was a good idea
to<00:02:40.040> do<00:02:40.159> that<00:02:40.189> but<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.419> got<00:02:42.319> done<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.590> all<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
to do that but I got done with all the

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.270 
to do that but I got done with all the
pennies<00:02:43.010> those<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.519> nice<00:02:43.750> zinc<00:02:44.750> ones

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
pennies those are the nice zinc ones

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.470 
pennies those are the nice zinc ones
some<00:02:46.280> nice<00:02:46.489> copper<00:02:46.849> ones<00:02:47.000> over<00:02:47.180> there<00:02:47.299> in<00:02:47.389> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
some nice copper ones over there in the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.379 
some nice copper ones over there in the
corner<00:02:47.949> but<00:02:48.949> let's<00:02:49.699> see<00:02:49.939> those<00:02:50.180> are<00:02:50.359> the

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
corner but let's see those are the

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.789 
corner but let's see those are the
2009's<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.439> think<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:52.040> got<00:02:52.370> 20<00:02:52.730> 2009<00:02:53.469> pennies<00:02:54.469> a

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
2009's I think I got 20 2009 pennies a

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.869 
2009's I think I got 20 2009 pennies a
couple<00:02:55.459> 82<00:02:55.819> zinc's<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.569> set<00:02:56.870> aside<00:02:56.959> I

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
couple 82 zinc's that I set aside I

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.819 
couple 82 zinc's that I set aside I
would<00:02:58.879> say<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.150> think<00:02:59.299> one<00:02:59.930> pretty<00:03:00.439> obvious

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
would say I think one pretty obvious

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.500 
would say I think one pretty obvious
offset<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.699> then<00:03:02.689> one<00:03:02.930> Canadian<00:03:04.510> for

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
offset and then one Canadian for

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.349 
offset and then one Canadian for
estimate<00:03:05.930> marks<00:03:06.319> there<00:03:08.199> 159<00:03:09.199> and<00:03:10.209> let's<00:03:11.209> take

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
estimate marks there 159 and let's take

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.909 
estimate marks there 159 and let's take
a<00:03:11.419> look<00:03:11.569> at<00:03:11.689> the<00:03:11.810> weeds<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.290> got<00:03:12.439> quite<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.709> few

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
couple 57 DS a 58 and a 58 D so that's a

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.789 
couple 57 DS a 58 and a 58 D so that's a
total<00:03:43.129> of<00:03:43.220> 18<00:03:43.639> weeks<00:03:44.259> let's<00:03:45.259> take<00:03:45.439> a<00:03:45.470> look<00:03:45.680> at

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
total of 18 weeks let's take a look at

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.149 
total of 18 weeks let's take a look at
the<00:03:46.129> sheet<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.549> here<00:03:47.859> percentage<00:03:48.859> of<00:03:48.949> box

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
the sheet right here percentage of box

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.089 
the sheet right here percentage of box
copper<00:03:49.579> 21<00:03:49.939> percent<00:03:50.359> best<00:03:50.900> roll<00:03:51.169> had<00:03:51.439> 18<00:03:51.829> in<00:03:51.859> it

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
copper 21 percent best roll had 18 in it

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.890 
copper 21 percent best roll had 18 in it
an<00:03:52.519> average<00:03:53.090> parole<00:03:53.449> was<00:03:53.780> 11<00:03:54.439> copper<00:03:55.189> pennies

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
an average parole was 11 copper pennies

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.719 
an average parole was 11 copper pennies
and<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.469> think<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.739> showed<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.489> rest<00:03:58.639> of

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
and I think I showed you the rest of

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.030 
and I think I showed you the rest of
that<00:03:58.879> so<00:03:59.239> overall<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.989> was<00:04:00.109> a<00:04:00.139> it<00:04:00.680> was<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.829> pretty

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
that so overall it was a it was a pretty

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.429 
that so overall it was a it was a pretty
good<00:04:01.189> box<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.639> is<00:04:01.699> enjoyable<00:04:01.939> to<00:04:02.209> do<00:04:02.329> like<00:04:03.319> I

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
good box it is enjoyable to do like I

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.819 
good box it is enjoyable to do like I
said<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.680> got<00:04:03.889> an<00:04:04.040> uncirculated<00:04:04.489> role<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.829> let's

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
said I got an uncirculated role of let's

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.719 
said I got an uncirculated role of let's
see<00:04:07.039> the<00:04:07.449> 2014<00:04:08.449> there<00:04:09.129> just<00:04:10.129> a<00:04:10.189> couple<00:04:10.370> missing

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
see the 2014 there just a couple missing

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.539 
see the 2014 there just a couple missing
but<00:04:10.969> almost<00:04:11.299> full<00:04:11.599> roll<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.989> that<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.280> think

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
but almost full roll of that so I think

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.439 
but almost full roll of that so I think
he<00:04:13.639> is<00:04:13.759> for<00:04:13.969> watching<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.509> happy<00:04:15.319> hunting
