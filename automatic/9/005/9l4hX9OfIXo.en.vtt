 on the eve of a wonderful holiday 23 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.070

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.619

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 polymeric clinics metal blade 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.230

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.750
 tassel round catarrh brown 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.200
 acrylic and light polymer 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.349
 clay 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.449
 bodily or champagne from the internet i 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.269

 will suit men's topics 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.500
 crush the foil to make a texture on 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 back of the pendant and roll out 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.910
 clay on the foil surface 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.010
 I choose the right image and with 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.850
 using angles borisova outlines of the figure 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 on a surface 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.600
 a metal brush I put grooves along 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.110
 the whole workpiece without touching the lines itself 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.110
 pattern 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.450
 just told polymer clay 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.450
 I spread the picture on the contours 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.760
 I make small notches on the stand out 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.740
 strip thus before infusing them 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.520
 surface and giving them an uneven look 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.520
 painted texture 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 I cut out the billet pendant round which 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.460
 and making holes for the cord 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.940
 also over the entire surface of the pattern on 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.710
 our grooves so that the drawing does not seem 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.710
 blank after coating paint 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.600
 I burn the workpiece at a temperature of 130 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.540
 degrees ten minutes 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.020
 that it cools down and covers brown 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.120
 paint 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.720
 trying to remember all the cracks on 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.720
 surface 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.270
 five minutes later I remove the excess paint 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.350
 wet cloth so the paint will remain 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.970
 only in the grooves 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.970
 and give the pendant a clear outline 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.560
 apply a thin layer of lacquer to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.560
 fix paint on the surface 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.500
 pendant ready to be assembled cut off the cord 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.260
 the desired length and warm it through 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.629
 the hole on the pendant I tighten the edges 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.609
