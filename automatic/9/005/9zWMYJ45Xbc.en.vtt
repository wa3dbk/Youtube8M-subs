use salt they didn't use refrigerators

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
use salt they didn't use refrigerators
because<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.960> didn't<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> freeze<00:01:04.559> things

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
because you didn't have to freeze things

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.820 
because you didn't have to freeze things
I<00:01:05.129> bet<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> use<00:01:06.030> salt<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> preserve<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> then

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I bet you use salt to preserve and then

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.649 
I bet you use salt to preserve and then
you<00:01:07.920> wash<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.549> salt<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you wash it off to salt and then you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.000 
you wash it off to salt and then you
could<00:01:09.840> eat<00:01:10.049> or<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.290> whatever<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> do

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
