real root apart from protectionism which

real root apart from protectionism which

expensive which incidentally also helps

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970

with<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.969> massive<00:00:48.390> gap<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> balance<00:00:49.800> of

with the massive gap in the balance of

of import and export in the United

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.350 
of import and export in the United

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
States and the way to do that is to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
States and the way to do that is to
allow<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.199> exchange<00:00:55.590> rate<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> change<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
allow the exchange rate the change to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
allow the exchange rate the change to
allow<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> dollars<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.020> fall<00:00:58.260> not

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
allow that the dollars are fall not

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
allow that the dollars are fall not
dramatically<00:00:59.160> not<00:00:59.550> precipitously<00:01:00.149> but

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
dramatically not precipitously but

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
dramatically not precipitously but
gradually<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.559> fact<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> exactly

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
gradually and in fact that is exactly

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
gradually and in fact that is exactly
what<00:01:02.670> has<00:01:02.789> happened<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> direct<00:01:04.019> result

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
what has happened and as a direct result

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.700 
what has happened and as a direct result
of<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.129> been<00:01:05.369> much<00:01:05.580> easier<00:01:05.610> for

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
of that it's been much easier for

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
of that it's been much easier for
American<00:01:07.710> companies<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.280> export<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
American companies to export and it's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.039 
American companies to export and it's
put<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> dampener<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> import

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
put a little bit of a dampener on import

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
put a little bit of a dampener on import
so<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.740> interesting<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.790> been

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so it's interesting that there has been

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
so it's interesting that there has been
this<00:01:15.030> amount<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> emotional<00:01:16.380> angst<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.189> his

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
this amount of emotional angst over his

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
this amount of emotional angst over his
comments<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.210> hate<00:01:18.840> mail<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.320> rest<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
comments I hate mail at the rest and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.179 
comments I hate mail at the rest and
which<00:01:20.759> perhaps<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.869> surprising<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.860> people

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
which perhaps is surprising for people

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
which perhaps is surprising for people
who<00:01:23.729> come<00:01:23.970> from<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.270> side<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.900> pond

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
who come from the other side of the pond

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830 
who come from the other side of the pond
from<00:01:25.439> places<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.189> UK<00:01:26.509> where<00:01:27.509> these

kinds of issues are much more have

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

dollars of dollar assets rapidly in turn

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
dollars of dollar assets rapidly in turn
it<00:02:36.030> would<00:02:36.240> cause<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> dive<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> value<00:02:37.620> of

it would cause a dive in the value of

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.100 
it would cause a dive in the value of
their<00:02:37.950> remaining<00:02:38.280> dollar<00:02:38.730> assets<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.420> for

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that reason it's not very likely that

these sovereign funds would make a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that we will continue to see what we

that we will continue to see what we
