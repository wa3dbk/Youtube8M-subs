00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:17.250
 organizational communications in 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.289
 communications management 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.769
 refers to the exchange of information between 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.930
 people the main purpose of communication 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.830
 process of understanding 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 information 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.230
 which is the subject of an exchange that is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.059
 message 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 however, the fact of sharing information is not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.149
 guarantees the effectiveness of communication 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.270
 exchange management people 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.020
 communications perform integrating 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.300
 unifying role generally accepted 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.590
 that communications are of great importance 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 for success organization polls showed 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:00.570
 that 63 percent English 73 percent 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.579
 American and 85 percent Japanese 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 managers consider the lack 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.610
 effective intraorganizational 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 communications 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.229
 the main obstacle to achieving 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 high performance of their 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 interpersonal communication companies 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.270
 are at the forefront of any 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.200
 research manager 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.150
 managers 50 to 80 percent working 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.110
 spends time in communicating with others 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.630
 top managers 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.689
 percentage of working time are engaged in communication 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.390
 reaches 90 therefore lack 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.590
 interpersonal communication skills can 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.689
 significantly reduce efficiency 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.790
 professional activity manager 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.009
 and organizations as a whole necessary 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.799
 condition of communication 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.079
 is the information 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.360
 however the concept of communication is not reduced 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.479
 only the concept of information or 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.180
 communication links in communications 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.990
 in addition to the information factor important 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.340
 the role plays 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.360
 personality factor 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.349
 with the same informational content 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.720
 communication can be carried out 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.970
 different and lead to different 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 results depending on the personality 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.190
 factor a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.290
 knowledge education character experience people 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.170
 participants of their communication 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.500
 relationship of likes and dislikes and 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.780
 many other communication in 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.510
 organizations can be formal and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.580
 informal and formal called 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.200
 communications 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.299
 relevant to the objectives 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.790
 organizations defined by rules 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.470
 job descriptions 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.470
 technological processes and so on 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.400
 information content may be 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.720
 different consider the main types 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.120
 organizational information on her 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.269
 content technical information 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.590
 for example technology instructions standards 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.480
 schemes and things like that financial 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.660
 information 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.790
 sales reports and profits they 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.980
 same not cash statement 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.980
 wages and things like that 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.150
 administrative or managerial 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.690
 information plans for the departments results 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.990
 control orders and orders and so 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.990
 Further 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.760
 socio-psychological information 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.970
 character opinion of employees about 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.459
 organizations are an expression of satisfaction and 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.459
 no satisfaction rumors 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.600
 the up 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.830
 very elements of communication 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.680
 process are sender face 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.030
 which generates generates information 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.130
 and passes it to another person 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.430
 the recipient is a person to whom 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.110
 intended information and which 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.240
 interprets that is interprets it 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.670
 message information itself 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.180
 I'm coded by any 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.180
 characters 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.630
 transmission channel 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.920
 formation decoding process 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.410
 information 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.770
 receiving party ie recipient 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.780
 feedback so sharing 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.760
 information between the sender and 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.830
 the recipient passes several 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.950
 interrelated stages emergence ideas 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.870
 coding and transmission channel selection 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.340
 messaging 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.510
 decoding information host 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.940
 side of what is encoding always 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.729
 we encode the transmitted information or 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.529
 we can do without this stage 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.259
 encoding is a transform 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:07.020
 information form convenient for the transfer and 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.150
 perception of the recipient in the conversation we 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.969
 we use a coding system which 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.240
 called the Russian language way 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.249
 coding also include letter 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.110
 mathematical outline symbols and the 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:21.510
 similar 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.560
 to the symbol or code we use 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.090
 also includes gestures and intonation 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.030
 it is therefore very important that the sender 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.730
 and the recipient had the same systems 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.740
 coding in other words to 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.980
 the recipient exactly and in full 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.750
 understood the sender's thoughts unfortunately 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.930
 even in everyday communication it is possible 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.080
 far from always managing the same value 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.290
 accuracy and completeness of information perception 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.290
 increases many times 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.450
 an important element of communication is 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.110
 feedback in the presence of feedback 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.300
 connections 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.020
 sender and receiver change 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.450
 communicative roles feedback 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.640
 can help reduce errors in 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.200
 understanding of information and significant 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.200
 increase management efficiency 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.430
 note the following quote 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.990
 good manager should be able to listen 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.750
 no less than talk so we 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.050
 considered the concept of organizational 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.050
 communications
