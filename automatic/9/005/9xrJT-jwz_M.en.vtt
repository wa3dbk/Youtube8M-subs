00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
in a detail people just aren't used to

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.220 
in a detail people just aren't used to
and<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.250> think<00:00:37.340> they're<00:00:37.520> gonna<00:00:37.610> really<00:00:37.790> like

they will come into play as the price

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.340

comes<00:00:41.300> down<00:00:41.480> on<00:00:41.600> these<00:00:41.720> sets<00:00:41.930> over<00:00:42.080> the<00:00:42.200> next

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
comes down on these sets over the next

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.630 
comes down on these sets over the next
couple<00:00:42.590> years<00:00:42.650> but<00:00:43.310> one<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.490> the<00:00:43.610> challenges

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
couple years but one of the challenges

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.330 
couple years but one of the challenges
is<00:00:44.330> how<00:00:44.360> do<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:44.720> get<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.110> content<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
is how do you get the content to the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.610 
is how do you get the content to the
sets<00:00:46.580> it's<00:00:47.540> a<00:00:47.660> lot<00:00:47.810> of<00:00:47.930> bits<00:00:48.110> it's<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.410> lot<00:00:48.530> of

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
sets it's a lot of bits it's a lot of

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.380 
sets it's a lot of bits it's a lot of
information<00:00:49.130> and<00:00:49.310> so<00:00:49.760> one<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:50.270> things

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
information and so one of the things

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.440 
information and so one of the things
we're<00:00:50.540> doing<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:50.960> developing<00:00:50.990> set-top<00:00:51.860> boxes

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
we're doing is developing set-top boxes

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.580 
we're doing is developing set-top boxes
developing<00:00:53.450> other<00:00:53.960> ways<00:00:54.200> to<00:00:54.380> get<00:00:54.500> the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
developing other ways to get the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.230 
developing other ways to get the
information<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:55.400> know<00:00:55.520> from<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.880> content

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
information you know from the content

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.480 
information you know from the content
providers<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.930> your<00:00:57.110> TV<00:00:57.290> set<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.190> here<00:00:58.400> we

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
providers to your TV set and so here we

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.430 
providers to your TV set and so here we
have<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:58.640> demonstration<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.540> one<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.050> HD

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
have a demonstration of one of the HD

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.040 
have a demonstration of one of the HD
Ultra<00:01:00.800> HD<00:01:00.860> sets<00:01:01.460> along<00:01:02.210> with<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> set-top<00:01:02.810> box

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
Ultra HD sets along with a set-top box

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.869 
Ultra HD sets along with a set-top box
that<00:01:03.320> would<00:01:03.410> enable<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.800> cable<00:01:04.129> provider<00:01:04.159> to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
that would enable a cable provider to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.340 
that would enable a cable provider to
get<00:01:05.000> information<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.720> will<00:01:05.900> also<00:01:06.170> work

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
get information to you will also work

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.710 
get information to you will also work
with<00:01:06.500> satellite<00:01:06.890> providers<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.520> others<00:01:07.720> it's

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
with satellite providers and others it's

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.290 
with satellite providers and others it's
it's<00:01:09.020> not<00:01:09.200> just<00:01:09.560> Ultra<00:01:09.980> HD<00:01:10.010> TV<00:01:10.580> we've<00:01:10.760> also<00:01:10.940> got

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
it's not just Ultra HD TV we've also got

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500 
it's not just Ultra HD TV we've also got
other<00:01:11.570> devices<00:01:11.840> such<00:01:12.080> as<00:01:12.340> 5g<00:01:13.340> Wi-Fi<00:01:14.240> can<00:01:14.420> you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
other devices such as 5g Wi-Fi can you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.000 
other devices such as 5g Wi-Fi can you
tell<00:01:14.659> us<00:01:14.690> about<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.110> well<00:01:15.650> one<00:01:15.800> of<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.979> other

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
tell us about that well one of the other

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.740 
tell us about that well one of the other
things<00:01:16.340> people<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.940> do<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.270> have<00:01:17.450> really

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
things people like to do to have really

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.330 
things people like to do to have really
fast<00:01:18.020> access<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.710> Internet<00:01:19.040> with<00:01:19.190> their

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
fast access to the Internet with their

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.100 
fast access to the Internet with their
laptops<00:01:20.030> or<00:01:20.270> their<00:01:20.450> tablets<00:01:20.870> or<00:01:20.990> their

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
laptops or their tablets or their

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.170 
laptops or their tablets or their
smartphones<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:22.010> what's<00:01:22.250> called<00:01:22.400> 5g<00:01:22.790> Wi-Fi

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
smartphones is what's called 5g Wi-Fi

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.880 
smartphones is what's called 5g Wi-Fi
and<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.840> enables<00:01:24.229> people<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.470> do<00:01:24.680> things

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
and that enables people to do things

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.100 
and that enables people to do things
much<00:01:25.280> faster<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.420> twice<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.930> range

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
much faster so it's it's twice the range

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.710 
much faster so it's it's twice the range
three<00:01:27.560> times<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.040> speed<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.490> lower<00:01:28.970> power

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
three times the speed and lower power

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.539 
three times the speed and lower power
which<00:01:30.080> means<00:01:30.290> your<00:01:30.680> battery<00:01:30.920> lasts<00:01:31.220> longer<00:01:31.520> in

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
which means your battery lasts longer in

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.550 
which means your battery lasts longer in
a<00:01:31.700> smartphone<00:01:32.120> so<00:01:32.570> we<00:01:32.659> have<00:01:32.810> access<00:01:33.229> points

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
a smartphone so we have access points
