for students on also university students
basically<00:00:47.299> let's<00:00:47.809> review<00:00:48.199> it<00:00:48.350> right<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:48.710> and

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
basically let's review it right now and

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.729 
basically let's review it right now and
after<00:00:49.129> let's<00:00:49.820> move<00:00:49.940> on<00:00:50.119> to<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.390> giveaway<00:00:50.739> so

after let's move on to the giveaway so

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.100 
after let's move on to the giveaway so
once<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.070> launch<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.519> app<00:00:52.869> you<00:00:53.869> have<00:00:53.989> this

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
once you launch the app you have this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.560 
once you launch the app you have this
window<00:00:54.530> which<00:00:54.710> appears<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.580> can<00:00:55.610> put<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.420> app

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
window which appears you can put the app

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.200 
window which appears you can put the app
in<00:00:56.780> full<00:00:56.989> screen<00:00:57.199> directly<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.640> let's<00:00:58.970> do<00:00:59.119> it

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
in full screen directly so let's do it

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.049 
in full screen directly so let's do it
right<00:00:59.390> now<00:00:59.500> so<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.799> basically<00:01:01.189> here<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.879> need

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
right now so and basically here you need

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.310 
right now so and basically here you need
to<00:01:02.089> make<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.570> new<00:01:02.989> node<00:01:03.439> and<00:01:04.900> just<00:01:05.900> type<00:01:06.110> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
to make a new node and just type the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.100 
to make a new node and just type the
title<00:01:06.500> first<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.430> let's<00:01:07.760> make<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.240> biological

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
title first so let's make a biological

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.160 
title first so let's make a biological
family<00:01:09.470> family<00:01:10.250> Treacher's<00:01:10.640> of<00:01:10.820> take<00:01:11.030> one<00:01:11.240> so

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
family family Treacher's of take one so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.070 
family family Treacher's of take one so
me<00:01:13.060> gender<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.090> mom<00:01:14.830> then<00:01:15.830> there<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.100> dad<00:01:17.080> then

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
me gender is mom then there is dad then

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.720 
me gender is mom then there is dad then
there<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.410> a<00:01:18.730> grandma<00:01:19.780> etc<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.320> let's<00:01:22.040> show<00:01:22.700> you

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
there is a grandma etc so let's show you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.120 
there is a grandma etc so let's show you
how<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.060> customize<00:01:23.390> some<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:24.200> stuff<00:01:24.440> so

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
how to customize some of this stuff so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.220 
how to customize some of this stuff so
let's<00:01:25.430> select<00:01:25.760> grandma<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:26.600> example<00:01:27.080> let's

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
let's select grandma for example let's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.420 
let's select grandma for example let's
go<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.160> inspector<00:01:28.510> thing<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:31.220> can

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
go to the inspector thing and you can

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.399 
go to the inspector thing and you can
what<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.820> can<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:32.810> change<00:01:33.260> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
what you can do is you can change the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.670 
what you can do is you can change the
style<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.010> branch<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.230> can<00:01:36.380> make<00:01:36.500> it

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
style of the branch so you can make it

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.070 
style of the branch so you can make it
like<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.100> like<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> box<00:01:38.000> or<00:01:38.390> just<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.050> a

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
like this like a box or just like a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.790 
like this like a box or just like a
branch<00:01:39.790> simply<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:41.990> change<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.530> color

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
branch simply you can change the color

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.360 
branch simply you can change the color
of<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.610> this<00:01:44.570> part<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.080> branch<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.620> can

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
of this this part of the branch you can

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.670 
of this this part of the branch you can
also<00:01:46.520> choose<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.000> endpoints<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:48.380> can<00:01:48.530> also

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
also choose the endpoints you can also

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.500 
also choose the endpoints you can also
shrink<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.370> size<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.880> branch<00:01:50.150> that<00:01:50.360> it

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
shrink the size of the branch that it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.190 
shrink the size of the branch that it
fits<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.350> actual<00:01:51.979> text<00:01:52.370> in<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.900> yeah<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:53.960> can

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
fits the actual text in it yeah you can

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.280 
fits the actual text in it yeah you can
also<00:01:54.380> align<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.040> text<00:01:55.570> if<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.840> have<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.260> a
