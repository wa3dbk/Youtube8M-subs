freezes every single time I started up

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.020

unfreeze and then show through the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.499 
unfreeze and then show through the
messages<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.649> I<00:01:11.860> missed<00:01:12.070> last<00:01:12.220> night<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.700> had

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
messages that I missed last night I had

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.929 
messages that I missed last night I had
my<00:01:13.539> finger<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.080> run<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.649> pressed<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.640> before

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
my finger on a run and pressed it before

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.999 
my finger on a run and pressed it before
looking<00:01:16.270> at<00:01:16.360> this<00:01:16.479> because<00:01:16.750> I<00:01:17.049> mean<00:01:17.289> this<00:01:17.799> is

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
looking at this because I mean this is

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.889 
looking at this because I mean this is
this<00:01:18.399> is<00:01:18.610> not<00:01:18.789> this<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.090> never<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.450> shortest

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
this is not this is never the shortest

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.450 
this is not this is never the shortest
time<00:01:20.049> so<00:01:20.649> I<00:01:20.679> figured<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:20.979> wouldn't<00:01:21.100> be<00:01:21.220> shiny

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
time so I figured it wouldn't be shiny

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.700 
time so I figured it wouldn't be shiny
which<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:21.970> mistake<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.390> my<00:01:22.600> part<00:01:22.899> but<00:01:23.500> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
which is a mistake of my part but the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.639 
which is a mistake of my part but the
DST<00:01:24.220> didn't<00:01:24.729> respond<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:26.289> that's<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
DST didn't respond and so that's the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.350 
DST didn't respond and so that's the
only<00:01:27.039> reason<00:01:27.399> this<00:01:27.490> thing<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.819> still<00:01:28.000> here<00:01:28.209> is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
only reason this thing is still here is

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.120 
only reason this thing is still here is
because<00:01:28.450> ideas<00:01:28.959> didn't<00:01:29.319> respond<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:36.009> yeah

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
because ideas didn't respond but yeah

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.749 
because ideas didn't respond but yeah
