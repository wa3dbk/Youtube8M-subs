00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you want to do you want to make sure the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.960 
you want to do you want to make sure the
arms<00:02:52.830> are<00:02:52.980> tucked<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.340> along<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.760> side

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
arms are tucked in along the side

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.160 
arms are tucked in along the side
there's<00:02:54.240> cruise<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.720> other<00:02:54.870> side<00:02:55.050> right

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
there's cruise on the other side right

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.900 
there's cruise on the other side right
there<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:55.980> makes<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.460> little<00:02:56.640> bit<00:02:56.760> more

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
there it just makes it a little bit more

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.910 
there it just makes it a little bit more
easier<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.900> tuck<00:02:57.990> them<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.260> along<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
easier so just tuck them in along the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.260 
easier so just tuck them in along the
side<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:02.730> basically

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
side just like that and then basically

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.690 
side just like that and then basically
all<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.570> have<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.530> pull<00:03:04.800> back<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.610> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
all you have to do is pull back and you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940 
all you have to do is pull back and you
can<00:03:05.820> see<00:03:05.850> drift<00:03:06.270> transforming<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:07.440> into<00:03:07.500> his

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
can see drift transforming back into his

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.070
