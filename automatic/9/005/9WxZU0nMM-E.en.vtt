00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.589
 talk about honda today because 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.339
 the problem is where will i be today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.069
 speak 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.719
 most often found in that model so 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.719
 it turns out to be during startup when 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 help electric starter 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:22.769
 the doctor starts to fail 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.720
 jumps out and does not start the motor people there 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.340
 already broke some head about 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.619
 why is this happening and why exactly 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.710
 candela why con divide honestly 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 still a mystery to me 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.000
 because the bendix is â€‹â€‹the same everywhere 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.370
 also what are on children's models 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.510
 also on since she is so starting the engine 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.059
 and they even have let's say suzuki on the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.950
 same note is also very similar bendix unless 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.600
 that they have a primary gear 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.010
 another ass concludes next inside 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 there is 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.170
 centrifugal load they spring work 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.870
 which are often very tight here you 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.780
 need to glorify 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.500
 show 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 so it is often not necessary 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.990
 it comes to this one here you are all here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.740
 worth 3 centrifugal loads which 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 pursed spring spring here this 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.400
 the spring is often very tough and it 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.979
 there will be anton jogging 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.690
 does not allow to disperse and fix 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:36.210
 public ratchet positions 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:41.229
 that is, what happens during launch a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.570
 calls when you push the button 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.530
 the starter part is not jumping out and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.450
 hitting the flywheel will hide back 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.180
 so that same one appears 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.270
 simple it all happens because 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.030
 so that the spring holds tight 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.369
 loads enough spring a little bit 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.990
 loosen and load will be fixed 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.410
 your gear not giving gear 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.410
 hide back everything's all just 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.069
 why am i doing this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.130
 probably because otherwise my secrets 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.120
 what number so advise sharing 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.120
 the secrets that
