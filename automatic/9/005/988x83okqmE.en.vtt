00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
within the last year or two I'll compare

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.549 
within the last year or two I'll compare
it<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.289> original<00:00:31.830> booyah<00:00:33.170> as<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.410> see

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it to the original booyah as you can see

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620 
it to the original booyah as you can see
there<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> very<00:00:34.980> similar<00:00:35.430> same<00:00:36.180> company<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
there is very similar same company of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.860 
there is very similar same company of
course<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.239> wider

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
course it's a little bit wider

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.310 
course it's a little bit wider
not<00:00:40.170> nearly<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.590> narrow<00:00:41.239> looks<00:00:42.239> more<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:43.020> my

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
not nearly as narrow looks more in my

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.250 
not nearly as narrow looks more in my
opinion<00:00:43.680> more<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> bullfrog<00:00:45.140> just<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
opinion more like a bullfrog just a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
opinion more like a bullfrog just a
size-wise<00:00:46.770> goes<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
size-wise goes and you can see that the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
size-wise goes and you can see that the
cupped<00:00:48.629> lip<00:00:48.870> versus<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> original<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
cupped lip versus the original so this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.380 
cupped lip versus the original so this
one<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.730> spit<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.820> blurp

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
one will spit and in you know blurp

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.920 
one will spit and in you know blurp
water<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> popper<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
water just like a popper would and it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510 
water just like a popper would and it
just<00:00:58.109> creates<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.559> disturbance<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.219> top<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
just creates more disturbance on top of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
just creates more disturbance on top of
the<00:00:59.640> water<00:00:59.899> then<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> traditional

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the water then you know a traditional

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
the water then you know a traditional
frog<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> copper<00:01:03.809> or

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
frog would and I have a copper or

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.760 
frog would and I have a copper or
starting<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.350> coppers<00:01:04.769> um<00:01:05.240> aspro<00:01:06.770> popping

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
starting on coppers um aspro popping

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.980 
starting on coppers um aspro popping
frog<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.780> two

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
frog here and as you can see the two

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
frog here and as you can see the two
different<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> mouths<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.270> bit

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
different the mouths are a little bit

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
different the mouths are a little bit
different<00:01:12.630> than<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> SPRO<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
different than one of the SPRO is a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.280 
different than one of the SPRO is a
little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.710> bigger<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.820> will<00:01:15.290> chug

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
little bit bigger so this one will chug

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
little bit bigger so this one will chug
some<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.830> water<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.430> spit<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:17.909> more<00:01:18.030> water

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
some more water and spit some more water

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
some more water and spit some more water
and<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:19.799> spits<00:01:20.220> more

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and this one I think this one spits more

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
and this one I think this one spits more
than<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> does<00:01:20.970> chug<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.770> make

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
than it does chug this one will make

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
than it does chug this one will make
like<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> big<00:01:23.250> blur<00:01:23.549> sound<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.570> just

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like a big blur sound and this one just

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
like a big blur sound and this one just
kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> spits<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> makes<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.580> bit

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
kind of spits and makes a little bit

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.539 
kind of spits and makes a little bit
more<00:01:26.759> commotion<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:28.770> all-around<00:01:29.220> frog

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
opinion it's a really really good

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
opinion it's a really really good
starter<00:01:49.409> frog<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.220> sure<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
starter frog if you're not sure if the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
starter frog if you're not sure if the
bathroom<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> fighting<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> popping<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
bathroom you fighting a popping one or a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.649 
bathroom you fighting a popping one or a
non<00:01:52.500> popping<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> day<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.450> price

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
non popping one for the day the price

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.700 
non popping one for the day the price
point<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.049> good<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.619> like

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
point is really good I think it's like

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.280 
point is really good I think it's like
579<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.909> something<00:01:57.570> pretty<00:01:57.780> close<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
579 and something pretty close to that

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530
