2250 MH lithium polymer battery so let's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.990 
2250 MH lithium polymer battery so let's
go<00:01:03.930> ahead<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> open<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> box<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> there

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
go ahead and open up the box so there

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.810 
go ahead and open up the box so there
you<00:01:09.180> go

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you go

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.250 
you go
so<00:01:11.820> folks<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> top<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so folks at the top you can see the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.679 
so folks at the top you can see the
soloqueue<00:01:14.040> tented<00:01:14.490> eye<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:18.570> keep

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
soloqueue tented eye so we will keep

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
soloqueue tented eye so we will keep
that<00:01:18.750> aside<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> time<00:01:19.470> being<00:01:19.830> while<00:01:20.040> they

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that aside for the time being while they

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.140 
that aside for the time being while they
focus<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:21.060> else<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.600> inside<00:01:22.820> at<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> very

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
focus on what else is inside at the very

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.780 
focus on what else is inside at the very
top<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.320> flip<00:01:25.770> cover<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.460> comes

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
top you can see a flip cover that comes

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.410 
top you can see a flip cover that comes
with<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> box<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:28.140> take<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
with in the box let's take it out I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.730 
with in the box let's take it out I
really<00:01:30.420> wish<00:01:30.600> manufacturer<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.350> start

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
really wish manufacturer would start

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.240 
really wish manufacturer would start
using<00:01:32.009> zip<00:01:32.700> locks<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> difficult<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> get

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
using zip locks it's difficult to get

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.840 
using zip locks it's difficult to get
these<00:01:35.970> open<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.430> folks

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
these open so there you have folks

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.780 
these open so there you have folks
that's<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> flip<00:01:40.079> cover<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:41.189> seems<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.700> be

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that's the flip cover that seems to be

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.429 
that's the flip cover that seems to be
made<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> leather<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.689> stitching<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
made of leather the stitching on the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.219 
made of leather the stitching on the
side<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> replacement<00:01:45.899> so

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
side and it's a back of a replacement so

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499 
side and it's a back of a replacement so
it<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.530> remove<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> back<00:01:47.280> cover<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it will remove the back cover and you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.440 
it will remove the back cover and you
would<00:01:48.630> place<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.320> instead<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
would place this on instead so it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
would place this on instead so it
doesn't<00:01:51.750> fold<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> stand<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
doesn't fold up like the stand on the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.190 
doesn't fold up like the stand on the
soloqueue<00:01:53.729> 2500<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> also<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
soloqueue 2500 then you also have a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.709 
soloqueue 2500 then you also have a
screen<00:01:58.200> guard<00:01:58.409> within<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> box<00:01:59.360> that's<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
screen guard within the box that's a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.410 
screen guard within the box that's a
great<00:02:00.930> addition<00:02:03.680> next<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.299> the
