00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
little progress on the front area of the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.970 
little progress on the front area of the
Mustang<00:00:11.719> in<00:00:12.719> previous<00:00:13.139> videos<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.619> showed<00:00:13.860> how

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
Mustang in previous videos I showed how

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.060 
Mustang in previous videos I showed how
to<00:00:14.039> put<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.279> the<00:00:14.340> firewall<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.150> cow<00:00:16.070> these

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to put in the firewall the cow these

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.089 
to put in the firewall the cow these
side<00:00:17.340> panels<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.289> left<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> top<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:20.009> the

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
side panels and I left the top of the

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.060 
side panels and I left the top of the
cowl<00:00:20.310> off<00:00:20.640> which<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> sitting<00:00:21.810> right<00:00:21.900> there

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
cowl off which is sitting right there

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.139 
cowl off which is sitting right there
recently<00:00:23.699> I've<00:00:23.970> blended<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.320> welds<00:00:26.149> and

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
recently I've blended down the welds and

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.790 
recently I've blended down the welds and
I'll<00:00:27.270> treat<00:00:27.599> those<00:00:27.809> before<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.469> put<00:00:28.649> anything

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
I'll treat those before I put anything

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.609 
I'll treat those before I put anything
else<00:00:29.040> on<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:30.750> had<00:00:30.899> to<00:00:30.960> straighten<00:00:31.200> out<00:00:31.379> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
else on and I had to straighten out the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.130 
else on and I had to straighten out the
lip<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.540> -<00:00:34.910> welds<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> cow

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
lip up here where the - welds to the cow

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.549 
lip up here where the - welds to the cow
up<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:39.059> course<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> drill

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
up here of course I'm going to drill

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.549 
up here of course I'm going to drill
some<00:00:40.680> holes<00:00:41.149> along<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.300> edge<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
some holes along this edge and then a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
some holes along this edge and then a
weld<00:00:43.829> back<00:00:44.039> to<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.269> you<00:00:45.359> remember<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
weld back to this and if you remember I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.149 
weld back to this and if you remember I
didn't<00:00:45.989> drill<00:00:46.140> through<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.409> I<00:00:46.589> ground<00:00:46.949> off

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
didn't drill through that I ground off

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.579 
didn't drill through that I ground off
the<00:00:47.999> old<00:00:48.149> cow<00:00:48.390> panel<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> I'd<00:00:49.199> have<00:00:49.379> good

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
the old cow panel so that I'd have good

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.660 
the old cow panel so that I'd have good
parent<00:00:49.920> metal<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.850> weld<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.489> thing

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
parent metal to weld to the other thing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.099 
parent metal to weld to the other thing
I<00:00:53.760> plan<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:53.999> do<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.479> haven't<00:00:54.690> done<00:00:54.780> yet<00:00:54.989> I'm

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
I plan to do and I haven't done yet I'm

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.399 
I plan to do and I haven't done yet I'm
probably<00:00:55.679> that<00:00:55.829> today<00:00:56.129> yet<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:57.050> put<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.199> seam

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
probably that today yet is put some seam

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.989 
probably that today yet is put some seam
sealer<00:00:58.800> around<00:00:59.339> the<00:01:00.179> the<00:01:00.510> towers<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.999> it's

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
sealer around the the towers here it's

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.299 
sealer around the the towers here it's
it's<00:01:03.449> probably<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.899> necessary<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> just

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it's probably not necessary but I just

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's probably not necessary but I just
want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.870> there's<00:01:07.080> an

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
want to do it is you can see there's an

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.690 
want to do it is you can see there's an
edge<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.620> I<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.190> there's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
edge there and I know that there's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090 
edge there and I know that there's
minimal<00:01:08.940> paint<00:01:09.530> holding<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.590> together

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
minimal paint holding that together

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
minimal paint holding that together
I<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.370> it's<00:01:11.580> spot<00:01:12.270> welded<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.750> there's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
I know it's spot welded but there's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
I know it's spot welded but there's
minimal<00:01:13.110> paint<00:01:13.440> filling<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> gap<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
minimal paint filling in that gap so I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.120 
minimal paint filling in that gap so I
will<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.690> seam<00:01:16.110> sealer<00:01:16.470> around<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
will put some seam sealer around that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.320 
will put some seam sealer around that
make<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.910> smooth<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.370> again<00:01:20.370> I'll<00:01:20.550> paint

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
make it smooth and again I'll paint

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.890 
make it smooth and again I'll paint
inside<00:01:21.840> where<00:01:22.530> I've<00:01:23.270> ground<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> welds<00:01:24.720> down

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
inside where I've ground the welds down

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.900 
inside where I've ground the welds down
I'll<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:25.830> wealthy<00:01:26.160> I'll<00:01:26.370> probably<00:01:26.610> put

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
I'll put some wealthy I'll probably put

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.870 
I'll put some wealthy I'll probably put
some<00:01:27.180> self-etch<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:29.190> when<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.460> my

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
some self-etch and then when I do my

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.620 
some self-etch and then when I do my
final<00:01:30.270> prep<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.800> on<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.880> front<00:01:33.390> edge

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
final prep up here on the front edge

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.520 
final prep up here on the front edge
with<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.680> holes<00:01:34.920> I'll<00:01:36.020> mark<00:01:37.020> those<00:01:37.170> areas

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
with my holes I'll mark those areas

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
with my holes I'll mark those areas
inside<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.160> maybe<00:01:38.370> they'll<00:01:38.670> probably<00:01:38.820> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
inside here maybe they'll probably just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.790 
inside here maybe they'll probably just
duplicate<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.690> are<00:01:39.870> but<00:01:40.170> I'll<00:01:40.500> put

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
duplicate where these are but I'll put

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.940 
duplicate where these are but I'll put
some<00:01:41.130> weld<00:01:42.120> through<00:01:42.330> primer<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.800> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
some weld through primer up here so that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.690 
some weld through primer up here so that
this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.430> sealed<00:01:45.860> no<00:01:46.860> bare<00:01:47.040> metal<00:01:47.250> inside

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this is more sealed no bare metal inside

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.920 
this is more sealed no bare metal inside
to<00:01:47.940> gather<00:01:48.540> water<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> rust<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.930> making

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
to gather water and rust so making

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.390 
to gather water and rust so making

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
I also sprayed it with a weld through

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.630 
I also sprayed it with a weld through
primer<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:27.799> prepped<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.690> upper<00:02:29.930> panel<00:02:30.640> so

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
primer and I prepped the upper panel so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.970 
primer and I prepped the upper panel so
all<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.849> holes<00:02:32.030> are<00:02:32.120> ready<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.420> go<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.890> they

were really happy when they built this

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.289 
were really happy when they built this
at<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.480> factory<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.930> duplicated<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.560> holes

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
at the factory I duplicated the holes

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.630
