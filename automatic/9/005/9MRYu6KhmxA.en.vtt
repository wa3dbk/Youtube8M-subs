00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.919
 that there are people from youtube here know how to see 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.130
 if this first of all thank you very much 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.900
 for commenting on the past video to see it 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.520
 for commenting and well I hope that really 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.220
 they worked and served them 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.430
 very much this time I bring you a 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.590
 super simple video a super exercise 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.170
 simple too and good to enjoy it 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.360
 I will comment on the exercise it is 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.240
 to put all four fingers in one 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.670
 super important fret 42 on a fret 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.529
 because 4 to 1 and tackle because good 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.030
 we have the habit of 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.760
 recorded the mind that others are 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.789
 put like this like that or whatever but never 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.370
 they are like this or they are never going to touch 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.839
 be one after another then what happens 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.149
 let's practice this because this is not going 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.800
 to generate a lot of independence apart is 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.329
 terrific exercise to warm up 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.949
 because we practice with the right hand 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.019
 because we have with the left hand and 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.519
 we are in that and well we are not made 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.289
 so bored the warming because to 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.750
 me particularly personally I 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.850
 bored 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.050
 the exercise of the follower that I'm just going to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.050
 show and I'll start to explain 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.580
 what I want them to do and maintain and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.760
 study in the first exercise that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.450
 nothing thumb finger ok in this kind of 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.280
 service why 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.710
 we all touch with the thumb here 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.259
 up here down here we saw jimi hendrix 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.030
 do basses with the thumb we have 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.520
 seen a lot of using the thumb 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.860
 to mutilate the strings and touch more 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.479
 clean but many times we also 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.119
 you need to have the good and correct 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.030
 posture on the guitar then that 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.429
 I want you to keep your big toe here 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.920
 in the middle of the mast and make me 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.020
 a c although I'm going to mark a venue 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.429
 so that they see more or less than here 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 we have a c 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.060
 we keep the 'nice jogo' and we are 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.480
 a true c then they will be the way to 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.540
 the one that is not the hand 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.970
 because I want to see this 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.650
 because it will help us move 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.530
 quickly and without feeling restrained by 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.110
 the rest of wood what is left over in the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.960
 mast that we are not using then 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.820
 let's practice the exercise like this and what 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.430
 will happen when we are practicing 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.430
 suddenly as well as magically 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.719
 is going to let loose the magic and go to 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 have a moment where we're going to be 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.549
 touching the exercise and the finger 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.459
 it just is not going to be playing like 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.599
 such in more than it is going to be touching that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 is what I want to happen in the 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.689
 exercise aside I want you to keep 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.269
 a correct time on each note in each 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.840
 finger then first let's go to 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.310
 practice this with a metronome 44 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.310
 because well we have four fingers and 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.689
 second male keep correct this 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.129
 Please try while they are 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.450
 Doing the exercise will not be ups 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.450
 finger because it happens to me 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.530
 and there is more 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.260
 the important thing of this exercise also 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 is to maintain 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.180
 we keep doing away from home 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.090
 what is important in this exercise 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.560
 so what are we going to make him go down two 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.959
 versions of the exercise first we're going 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.670
 to do well just about the time we're going to 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.930
 with the right hand switch according 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.930
 what are we going to do this 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.739
 and now 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.840
 i 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.380
 today we have the series 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.380
 and that is the second part 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.520
 let's make the rope 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.680
 exercise I tell you because because this 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.950
 once although the frets are applied 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.370
 we started on the 5th fret by the way this 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.590
 guitar today these finals if less 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.489
 open and good to take it out there would have been 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.349
 very difficult 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.870
 as here down another one up there 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:27.250
 I do not really know where we would be tuning 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.250
 the affine block in my normal 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.280
 good what is important remember to do the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.190
 exercise by the way I would like 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 I really would like 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.380
 look for fingering patterns 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.980
 Seasonal changes not only 4 3 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.220
 1 2 3 4 this 31 24 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.680
 23 41 and so and apply them in the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.690
 exercise they are exchanging can 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.140
 do it all with just one or go 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.630
 changing in the fingering depends on the 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.460
 trust in which they are and alternating 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.130
 because that would also generate a lot 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.650
 more independence and good that we 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.300
 comment down because good is from another 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.710
 person out there that does not do it has 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.230
 been that we have a combination 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.370
 and the blog is shared as well as 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.510
 I am sharing the video with 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.340
 I am sharing this 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.050
 exercise with you then the idea of 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.270
 this is to share all and that really 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.980
 there is very good we learn more and in 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.470
 family 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.300
 what else I leave out there good nothing this 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.780
 exercise so they know how to take them out 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.340
 watching videos and a guitarist 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.260
 I want you to tell me what the 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.150
 guitarist because I do not know what 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.940
 see the exercise and the good ones is me 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.670
 only the guitarist in such song 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.760
 and to make the thing more fun and 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.380
 second that I practice 1 meter no 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.950
 well more nothing out there is a video of 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.230
 a song that says a few days ago 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.050
 and I would like you to hear it 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.240
 they will comment then to change the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.860
 song so that to know what they think 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.100
 of her and tell me more or less than 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.530
 they understand the song this really 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.180
 thanks for watching me I hope you enjoy 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.520
 I'll do the exercise once 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.200
 it puts you faster and I say goodbye 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.620
 you really thank you very much 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.620
 decisions
