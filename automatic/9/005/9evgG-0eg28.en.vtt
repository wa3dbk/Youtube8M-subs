00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 good balboa you say messi but what 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.870
 you say and study with him yes we vote 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.010
 the best player in the world surely 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.750
 Messi would achieve every year is not the debate 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.950
 who has done the best year a year 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.780
 natural who has made the best year 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 natural and when Messi won two 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 years indeed the best year had 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 done xavi or iniesta is true is true 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 and the success campaign from Barcelona 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.920
 club including including xavi and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.619
 iniesta campaigning interested that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 wins yes messi for what it was and also 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.180
 I tell you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.350
 mourinho started the campaign in favor of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.350
 Christian ronaldo met 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 no but because boxes never ever the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.640
 propaganda capacity of the club not the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 get the madrid they do not get it something 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.699
 it will not be because because you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 because you do not learn the colt that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.670
 Messi is good if truth is good 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.670
 but as 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.800
 the Christian league 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.430
 with the rules of luque on the goddess 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.750
 between these three names 2012 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 and boxes 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.270
 seriously I do not tell you by paul and art the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 Christian 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.530
 a league to madrid really framing 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.530
 in Christian 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.760
 he did not do well 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:07.970
 to read nonsense but for me Christian 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.780
 really 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:24.480
 30 meters yes but if you can not say 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.920
 that if not if Christian did not reach the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.950
 final said they have to give the value 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:36.900
 golden the golden golden ball and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.210
 it turns out that Mr. Messi is that is 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.170
 I repeat that is that now he applied the same 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.640
 what do you say 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.080
 the month and year of the world cup o 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.850
 closed in the quarterfinals and not the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.060
 thing that not put neither a goal nor a goal 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.440
 he left without scoring a goal 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.360
 means it turns out that last year or 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.410
 two years ago last year the game was played 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.670
 Copa America in Argentina and eliminates the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.670
 selection but 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.530
 but is less Christian does not win a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.129
 party alone much less than anything 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.129
 but remains 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.599
 we also agree to Christian 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:30.390
 this year I 'm not saying it's more 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:32.670
 players are the Christians and when 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.319
 He played Christian benzema and does not play 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.970
 Higuain very rarely played the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.299
 three equal in terms of game play 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.299
 headline 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.019
 headline 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.409
 it's not even necessary but I want to say 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.829
 that is not as destabilizing as messi 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.829
 at the barÃ§a 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.930
 although not 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.480
 Christian has made a season 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.860
 outstanding not beyond the league to the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.900
 madrid with his goals and with his 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.060
 performance are not the goals but the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.970
 performance participation as it has 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.710
 Christian fact has been above 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.590
 Messi the two are two tens in agreement 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.360
 but this 10 has also given him a league 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.730
 to madrid thing that the messi has not 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.560
 given this year to the club but this year 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.960
 Christian is golden ball or he is not going to 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.580
 be never but a month if not already that 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.110
 the golden ball for being better than 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.700
 Christian because then the ball of what 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.250
 it would be for ten years until it 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.160
 retire month and for him not this year 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.340
 Christian has been better than messi the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.290
 eurocopa has been a remarkable high of 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.150
 Christian and what's left of the season is 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.890
 lights then we go back to the one of the 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.220
 titles we are not testing who is the 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.160
 best 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.450
 as it says I read we return to that if the two 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.010
 they have done a very good season and although 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.380
 we are saying that messi has been better 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.960
 for some but like the other one wins the 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.390
 league is high has not got that plus 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.040
 which is to give your team the title of 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.250
 freedom forms has also said before 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.270
 I think the trophy is awarded from 1 to 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.380
 December 31 with other 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.710
 every three months that's what I say 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.030
 whenever they are left are not so remarkable 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.030
 as what is 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.080
 only a little 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.320
 after the eurocopa of 2008 that is him 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.300
 comes with cannavaro that in 2006 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.460
 being world champion they give him the ball 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.040
 from gold to cannavaro and after winning 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.320
 Spain 2008 because he thinks that because 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.910
 can not be and also in this because 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.850
 we are a little all of us who say it 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.700
 because not since mÃ³stoles be made 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.940
 votes are signed and that the 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.290
 end when the voting ends, a 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.600
 little disappointed but is that the 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.610
 exception is still much greater after 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.770
 of winning the world cup when they go there 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.500
 because he is among the best 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.990
 team and you have to come knowing that 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.970
 neither iniesta nor xavi win the golden ball 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.190
 that he was good was one of the most 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.800
 pissed off that night and I was not 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.340
 in the short list, much less to her was the 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.970
 auction 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:24.560
 and Juan al madrid and like that but I tell you 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.560
 what a golden ball thinks 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:36.740
 the covers of the world press because 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.320
 I get 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.360
 I tell you if you do not fear is precisely it 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.030
 is taking off the hat all over the world 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.639
 before him there is or not to win a league this 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.280
 year and always is as it says I read 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.580
 above good and evil this is of 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.580
 another galaxy 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.660
 as it is to say that they are sold
