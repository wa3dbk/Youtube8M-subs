now you inside you can see there's a
serrated<00:03:57.380> edge<00:03:57.740> in<00:03:58.100> there<00:03:58.400> that's<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.850> side

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
serrated edge in there that's the side

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.880 
serrated edge in there that's the side
that<00:03:59.150> goes<00:03:59.480> on<00:03:59.720> top<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.200> then<00:04:00.319> this<00:04:00.500> goes

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
that goes on top and then this goes

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.940 
that goes on top and then this goes
straight<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.370> top<00:04:02.350> in<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.470> perfect<00:04:03.920> world<00:04:05.950> hold

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
straight on top in a perfect world hold

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.140 
straight on top in a perfect world hold
this<00:04:07.100> down<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.810> can<00:04:08.810> see<00:04:09.850> this<00:04:10.850> comes

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
this down so you can see this comes

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.380 
this down so you can see this comes
through<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:12.280> then<00:04:13.280> when<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.670> tip<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.150> back

over it doesn't all fall to pieces on it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.979 
over it doesn't all fall to pieces on it
how<00:04:18.440> about<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.940> then<00:04:19.940> we<00:04:20.090> have<00:04:20.239> our<00:04:20.390> agitator

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
how about that then we have our agitator

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.990 
how about that then we have our agitator
the<00:04:21.350> bottom<00:04:21.709> half<00:04:24.130> goes<00:04:25.130> in<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.760> this<00:04:25.850> is

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
the bottom half goes in and this is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.730 
the bottom half goes in and this is
connected<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:27.050> shaft<00:04:27.350> on<00:04:27.650> the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
connected to the shaft on the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.250 
connected to the shaft on the
transmission<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.570> only<00:04:29.690> way<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.200> thing

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
transmission so the only way this thing

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.030 
transmission so the only way this thing
can<00:04:30.680> go<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:31.100> bum<00:04:31.460> bum<00:04:31.700> bum<00:04:31.940> bum<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:33.040> this

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
can go is bum bum bum bum like so this

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.130 
can go is bum bum bum bum like so this
has<00:04:34.990> keys<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.440> right<00:04:36.770> here<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.660> if<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:38.960> look

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
has keys on it right here so if we look

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.780 
has keys on it right here so if we look
inside<00:04:39.290> here<00:04:40.060> we<00:04:41.060> can<00:04:41.240> see<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.890> undead<00:04:43.370> right

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
inside here we can see the undead right

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.120 
inside here we can see the undead right
here<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.840> we<00:04:44.960> want<00:04:45.140> to<00:04:45.200> line<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.470> up<00:04:45.710> when<00:04:46.010> we
