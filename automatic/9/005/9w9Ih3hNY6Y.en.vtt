yard<00:01:06.299> without<00:01:06.600> having<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> change<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.260> maybe

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
yard without having the change of maybe

one<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:07.890> times<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:09.150> guess<00:01:09.360> actually<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
one or two times so my guess actually I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.690 
one or two times so my guess actually I
was<00:01:10.170> running<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> gas<00:01:10.680> my<00:01:11.010> gas<00:01:11.189> ended

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
before my line did so I still got a line

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the line is to begin with so that's not

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
the line is to begin with so that's not
really<00:03:40.860> too<00:03:41.010> long<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.520> line<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.300> as<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.810> can

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
really too long of a line and as you can

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.620 
really too long of a line and as you can
see<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.610> pretty<00:03:44.610> much<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:44.910> guess<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.420> still

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
see I pretty much I guess I was I still

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.180 
see I pretty much I guess I was I still
pretty<00:03:45.840> much<00:03:46.050> have<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.710> I'm<00:03:46.830> on<00:03:46.950> enough

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
pretty much have that that I'm on enough

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.040 
pretty much have that that I'm on enough
you're<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.060> little<00:03:48.210> bit<00:03:48.510> freed<00:03:48.750> at<00:03:48.930> the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
you're just a little bit freed at the

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.780 
you're just a little bit freed at the
end<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.440> mean<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.740> still<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.220> about<00:03:50.520> it's

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
end but I mean it still this about it's

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.610 
end but I mean it still this about it's
about<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.030> same<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.020> mean<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.260> guess<00:03:52.290> they're

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
about the same so I mean I guess they're

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.220 
about the same so I mean I guess they're
doing<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.100> city<00:03:53.340> doing<00:03:53.780> in<00:03:54.780> order<00:03:55.140> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
doing with the city doing in order to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.990 
doing with the city doing in order to
get<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> good<00:03:55.650> effective<00:03:56.130> cut<00:03:56.370> maybe<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.820> might

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
get a good effective cut maybe you might

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.490 
get a good effective cut maybe you might
want<00:03:57.270> to<00:03:57.390> make<00:03:57.660> your<00:03:57.900> line<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> little<00:03:58.380> bit
