00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
perfect shade now it doesn't take very

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.550 
perfect shade now it doesn't take very
much<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.900> blend<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.230> in

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
much to blend this in

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.850 
much to blend this in
but<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:20.120> can<00:02:20.330> that's<00:02:20.540> like<00:02:20.780> more<00:02:21.410> than<00:02:21.470> enough

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
but you can that's like more than enough

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.040 
but you can that's like more than enough
for<00:02:22.010> one<00:02:22.220> side<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.730> my<00:02:22.819> face<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.330> blend

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
for one side of my face you just blend

for one side of my face you just blend
all<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.910> creates<00:02:26.510> just

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
all this in and it just creates just

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.930 
all this in and it just creates just
this<00:02:27.170> nice<00:02:27.470> kind<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.010> even<00:02:28.310> texture<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.790> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
this nice kind of even texture that you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.180 
this nice kind of even texture that you
can<00:02:29.120> see<00:02:29.360> from<00:02:30.050> one<00:02:30.200> hand<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.650> have<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> mirror<00:02:31.099> in
