00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.260
 very good to everyone this point 5 the one 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.209
 I bring the mysterious UFO the tlc and see 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.520
 that you can already handle even though this 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.650
 it has a logical trick but the video 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.730
 I wanted to show you that and I have images or 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.560
 I have images I do not only have 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.640
 images but I have a video in the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.140
 what are you going to be able to see everything at 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.000
 Domiz perfection in front of video and 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.619
 austria ask you not to be told Ã¡lex and 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.869
 you like it with nothing more to add 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.630
 we start you have first 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.420
 tell you that everything is treated in a way that 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.390
 has created sb2 which is a pretty user 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.710
 recognized in what is in the world of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.320
 creation and modification of files 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.079
 within gta iv good this person 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.370
 also leaked for example weapons 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.500
 eliminated from the game as they were the ax 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.420
 there is some more and in this case you have created 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.309
 a way that replaces the trick of 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.070
 parachute for a trick to simply 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.780
 replace the vehicle you carry with you 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.700
 UFO of the FBI as you are seeing now 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.540
 same on screen of cb2 would be with its 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.379
 airplane activates the parachute trick and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.269
 Instantly the UFO is put on him 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.009
 starts to handle a UFO logically 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.890
 as the UFO is incredibly large 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.860
 it looks pretty weird and but by pressing 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.540
 the circle or the bp on xbox 360 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.310
 he would put the cinematography camera and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.020
 like it looks a little further and it 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.730
 would see very well at all times what 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.140
 is piloting the centrality what 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.700
 pilota is a plane but you see a UFO 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.740
 whereupon it would be practically 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.490
 pilot a comic book and it 's so cool this 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 affinity the mod 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.990
 It has been a great surprise because it is very 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.240
 curious and it's a simple way to power 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.920
 pilot a UFO in this game so 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.910
 which not only warned that this exists 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.650
 it also left us in the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.360
 description the link of the mod that has 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.250
 uploaded this user to install it 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.830
 those who want to use it logically that 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.050
 have the play properly configured 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.460
 to be able to put this type of mods 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.190
 only once you do it then you can 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.869
 have your UFO at your full disposal and 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.400
 handle it however you want in any case 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.350
 the real goal was to show you what 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.020
 because I had already taken videos even of 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.060
 clip that the probability of being able 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.050
 handle a UFO we do not know if in some 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.490
 future may be done in a 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.350
 absolutely legal but for now 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.540
 we have this solution or this solution 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.190
 provisionally in a way to give the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.690
 thanks again to cb 2 for the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.399
 contribution and without more 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.980
 I hope you have liked us 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.459
 leave your comment and greetings and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.459
 until next time
