00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
when I first found him and it was I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.979

a<00:00:34.020> couple<00:00:34.469> years<00:00:34.620> ago<00:00:34.800> we're<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.219> basic

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
a couple years ago we're not basic

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
so here's clone captain lock let me zoom

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.059 
so here's clone captain lock let me zoom
in<00:02:51.099> here<00:02:51.569> all<00:02:52.569> right<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.620> here<00:02:53.739> just<00:02:53.860> call<00:02:53.980> him

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
in here all right so here just call him

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.289 
in here all right so here just call him
captain<00:02:54.370> lock<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> his<00:02:57.190> blaster<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.910> coming

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
captain lock and his blaster is coming

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.559 
captain lock and his blaster is coming
off<00:02:58.450> its<00:02:59.170> held<00:02:59.349> by<00:02:59.500> an<00:02:59.560> elastic<00:02:59.920> band<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:01.450> we

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
off its held by an elastic band there we

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.890 
off its held by an elastic band there we
go

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
go

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.280 
go
so<00:03:02.260> :<00:03:02.860> captain<00:03:03.160> lock<00:03:03.340> does<00:03:04.000> feature<00:03:04.290> going

I<00:03:11.470> like<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.889> shoulder<00:03:12.190> pads<00:03:12.370> actually

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
I like that the shoulder pads actually

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.490 
I like that the shoulder pads actually
go<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.150> armor<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.049> actually<00:03:14.200> move

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
go in the armor so you can actually move

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.490 
go in the armor so you can actually move

thinking very first articulation for the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.550 
thinking very first articulation for the
clone<00:03:39.849> troopers<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.239> feature<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.109> you

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
clone troopers that feature that so you

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.440 
clone troopers that feature that so you
could<00:03:41.709> have<00:03:41.889> this<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.250> hold<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:42.790> put

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
could have this you can hold this put

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.839 
could have this you can hold this put
his<00:03:43.569> arm<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:44.950> really<00:03:45.190> cool<00:03:45.639> it

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
his arm in like that so really cool it

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.800 
his arm in like that so really cool it
