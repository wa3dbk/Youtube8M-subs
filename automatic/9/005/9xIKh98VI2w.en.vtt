00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 according to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.650
 and of course you can't do it for such a very special site van der 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.609
 chijs 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.679
 with some special ones so that I also feel that it was a problem 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 to come 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.050
 when the time comes and his name is there to care for a whole year 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.180
 special feeling and your father being there was again looking proud and me 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.530
 he is not honestly played an international match m yes but the knowledge that he 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.200
 if not then of course there should be plenty of years no but he also wants me there 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.650
 go over davids there is no bet I need that 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.650
 guess he's the more players that go with it 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 8 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.050
 made available in crucial places 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.170
 the labor in sweden 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.760
 he is still what more beautiful the games I think and I think a bit more up 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.660
 speed according to me 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.500
 Mohamed does have certain similarities but I think he is a nicer player 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.150
 To see how differently do you think the laundry had a lot to do with it 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.210
 Dutch soccerteam 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.900
 and now there are still many young boys I think there were a lot older then 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 who were in the rankings as my new contrast as my father 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.150
 so I think some exciting yet where I think you now easier because you 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.439
 have even better players and even faster 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249
 then it seems hard to get to the debate for him i think it is easy because 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.890
 you are 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.790
 has good football skills 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.509
 he can quickly get into percent 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.650
 I have that feeling 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.240
 yes so I also said to one it's evening was with us too 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.520
 buy and watch everything to go even faster 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.270
 so but I have a lot of quicker feet in between that you are expected to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.690
 He made the purchase if you now for the camera I have to give them what they are about 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.560
 doing it 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.119
 yes I have always thought it would be nice to have the back line on the field 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.290
 He can still take a series of certain things to so-called ones 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.360
 offers you honey 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.570
 I say what he must prove to be the man who has everything that happened that he is not 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.240
 more to stay back between bush though one then 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.720
 then you are constantly moving year at your best year 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.180
 keep moving and have the ser radiate then he knows that tasty 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.459
 velzen what a dream debut you could do 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.790
 arjen one of the beautiful action or the exact place on a flaming shot 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.219
 on goal
