 limousin in the agglomeration of limoges 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.820

 works there to limoges to double the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.899
 current capacity of the stadium 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.379
 to imagine the thing so good good 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.359

 this little problem if you are a little 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.909
 sporty you do it yourself and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.770
 is that we can ask the question 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.360
 of the utility of this stage of 21000 place 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 while there is not a single club of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.890
 even leading football of second 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.320
 plan to limoges and that there is no no 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.479

 limoges 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.760
 we had the madness of grandeur 1 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.530
 to make a stadium as important 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.970
 but I will tell you it's not serious 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.470
 ladies and gentlemen the taxpayers of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.130
 that a big stadium 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.570
 generosity of the taxpayer because 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.800

 perspective aesthetics beauty 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.000
