 radish is a nice flavor the only thing 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.150
 that you have to control the amount of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.060
 tender leaves that 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.120
 that we consume should not be more than 100 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.130
 daily grams because these leaves 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.130
 fresh tender 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.980

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.040
 substance is an acid that can cause 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.630
 the creation of kidney stones in 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.290
 the people who have some 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.760
 as for the roots of the moringa the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.150
 roots are used tree roots 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.880
 practically seedlings should 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.420
 have a height of about 10 centimeters 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.450
 and then they do more or less still root 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.140
 of this size 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.690

 thick and it looks like a small carrot what 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.769
 we wash well with brush in the water 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.800
 current and we can eat it like that 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.910

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.990
 now as to the benefits of the

 Moringa interesting thing about this plant 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.820
 that practically grows all year 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.350
 even in very dry conditions in 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.920
 dry periods 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.800
 This tree is bearing fruit follows 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.450

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.090
 to know that it has enough benefits 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.100
 We could mention many healing 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.990
 but among the ones that stand out the most is 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.360
 that moringa is used as 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.290
 coadjuvant in the treatment of 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.250

 is a plant that lowers the content of 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.170
 blood sugar and it is also used 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:57.170
 to lower the high pressure 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.160
 you have to know that like all plants 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.310
 medicinal products already have some effects 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.250
 side first you have to consider 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.110
 that moringa is slightly abortive 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.080
 it means that it is not recommended for 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.840

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.790
 take any part of this plant 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.250
 can also its excessive consumption can 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.639
 produce the polycythemia that is a 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.490
 exaggerated increase in red blood cells 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.360
 can also 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.550
 and produce some symptoms like pains 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.280
 head can cause some 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.099
 ringing in the ears dyspepsia or 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.229
 some gastric problems and in some 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.190
 especially sensitive people could 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.800
 cause happy allergies 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.080
 if any part of the 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.590
 fasting plant then it works like 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.830
 laxative and in terms of consumption by 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.530
 diabetics is very important to be 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.530
 checking your blood levels because if 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.160
 it is not monitored well and a 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.090
 amount without one without control then 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.670
 can produce a hypoglycemic shock 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.640
 that's in regards to some precautions 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.610
 what you have to have with this plant

 and if we take into account these 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.960
 precautions can take advantage of their 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.450
 multiple health benefits
