hi I just want to show you the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.540 
hi I just want to show you the
multicolored<00:00:06.240> tables<00:00:07.380> two<00:00:08.380> at<00:00:08.500> a<00:00:08.560> time<00:00:08.590> and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
multicolored tables two at a time and

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.540 
multicolored tables two at a time and
what<00:00:09.760> I've<00:00:09.880> been<00:00:10.000> doing<00:00:10.270> with<00:00:10.300> it<00:00:10.770> so<00:00:11.770> what

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
what I've been doing with it so what

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.630 
what I've been doing with it so what
I've<00:00:12.700> learned<00:00:12.970> is<00:00:13.690> how<00:00:14.290> to<00:00:14.680> move<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.870> colors

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I've learned is how to move the colors

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890 
I've learned is how to move the colors
going<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.170> down<00:00:20.289> on<00:00:20.440> that<00:00:20.590> sock<00:00:20.980> now<00:00:21.900> what

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
going up and down on that sock now what

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.279 
going up and down on that sock now what
I've<00:00:22.990> done<00:00:23.020> here<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.530> actually<00:00:23.890> put<00:00:25.289> two

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
I've done here is actually put two

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.960 
I've done here is actually put two
stitches<00:00:26.710> in<00:00:26.949> between<00:00:26.980> each<00:00:28.680> cable<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.699> that<00:00:30.730> I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
stitches in between each cable so that I

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.119 
stitches in between each cable so that I
could<00:00:31.240> get<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.810> little<00:00:32.079> more<00:00:32.289> extra<00:00:32.679> stretch

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
could get a little more extra stretch

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.000 
could get a little more extra stretch
out<00:00:33.940> of<00:00:34.149> them<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.440> was<00:00:35.620> definitely<00:00:35.769> a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
out of them and this was definitely a

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.130 
out of them and this was definitely a
learning<00:00:36.100> process<00:00:36.749> because<00:00:37.749> there's<00:00:38.079> a

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
learning process because there's a

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.439 
learning process because there's a
different<00:00:38.530> technique<00:00:38.890> from<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:40.089> kind<00:00:40.390> of

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
different technique from this kind of

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.799 
different technique from this kind of
cable<00:00:41.519> to<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:42.699> cables<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:43.179> are<00:00:43.300> actually

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
cable to the cables that are actually

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.639 
cable to the cables that are actually
knitted<00:00:44.140> right<00:00:44.469> next<00:00:45.159> to<00:00:45.249> each<00:00:45.370> other<00:00:46.499> so<00:00:47.499> one

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
knitted right next to each other so one

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.809 
knitted right next to each other so one
more<00:00:47.769> throw<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.280> how<00:00:49.149> you<00:00:49.210> move<00:00:50.429> this<00:00:51.429> stitch

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
more throw is how you move this stitch

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:58.349 
more throw is how you move this stitch
and<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.949> stitch<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.989> be<00:00:56.139> over<00:00:56.949> here<00:00:57.359> that's

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
and this stitch to be over here that's

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.020 
and this stitch to be over here that's
the<00:00:58.539> goal<00:00:58.749> in<00:00:59.260> tables<00:00:59.709> is<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.549> just<00:01:00.760> keep

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
the goal in tables is to just keep

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.959 
the goal in tables is to just keep
rearranging<00:01:03.869> the<00:01:04.869> stitches<00:01:05.409> until<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.490> have

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 
rearranging the stitches until you have

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.709 
rearranging the stitches until you have
the<00:01:07.149> angle<00:01:07.299> of<00:01:07.630> where<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.899> want<00:01:08.079> to<00:01:08.170> go<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.880> I'm

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
the angle of where you want to go so I'm

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:18.749 
the angle of where you want to go so I'm
here<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:13.000> actually<00:01:13.539> curling<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:17.469> cable<00:01:17.799> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
here I'm actually curling the cable the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.219 
here I'm actually curling the cable the
needles<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.149> I<00:01:19.210> have<00:01:19.450> are<00:01:19.659> actually<00:01:19.990> about

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
needles that I have are actually about

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.410 
needles that I have are actually about
60<00:01:20.799> inches<00:01:20.859> long<00:01:21.539> with<00:01:22.539> this<00:01:22.719> cord<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.430> that

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
60 inches long with this cord so that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.910 
60 inches long with this cord so that
definitely<00:01:25.780> helps<00:01:26.049> a<00:01:26.109> lot<00:01:26.289> if<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.560> can<00:01:26.710> get

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
definitely helps a lot if you can get

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.969 
definitely helps a lot if you can get
one<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.079> really<00:01:29.170> long<00:01:29.289> that's

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
one and have it really long that's

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:30.709 
one and have it really long that's
awesome

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
awesome

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.580 
awesome

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590

on moving because my design I have these
coming<00:05:59.130> up<00:05:59.280> and<00:05:59.610> kind<00:06:00.330> of<00:06:00.440> rolling<00:06:01.440> over<00:06:01.760> and

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
coming up and kind of rolling over and

coming up and kind of rolling over and
so<00:06:02.940> I<00:06:02.970> want<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.210> keep<00:06:03.360> on<00:06:03.600> moving<00:06:03.780> one<00:06:06.500> show

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
so I want to keep on moving one show

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.940 
so I want to keep on moving one show
over<00:06:07.680> here<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:09.030> then<00:06:09.150> another<00:06:09.180> one<00:06:09.570> oh<00:06:10.020> yeah

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
over here and then another one oh yeah

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.570 
over here and then another one oh yeah
and<00:06:11.910> this<00:06:12.290> row<00:06:13.290> of<00:06:13.530> three<00:06:13.800> pink<00:06:14.070> will<00:06:14.340> keep

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
and this row of three pink will keep

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.080 
and this row of three pink will keep
moving<00:06:15.090> and<00:06:15.240> arching<00:06:15.780> in<00:06:16.200> this<00:06:16.800> direction

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
moving and arching in this direction

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.660 
moving and arching in this direction
until<00:06:18.090> I<00:06:18.120> choose<00:06:18.630> to<00:06:18.810> be<00:06:18.900> done<00:06:19.520> here's<00:06:20.520> the

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
until I choose to be done here's the

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
until I choose to be done here's the
last<00:06:20.880> follow<00:06:21.240> up<00:06:21.980> these<00:06:22.980> actually<00:06:23.430> have

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
last follow up these actually have

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.440 
last follow up these actually have
stitches<00:06:24.690> in<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.870> middle<00:06:25.170> which<00:06:25.950> is<00:06:26.210> not<00:06:27.210> what

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
stitches in the middle which is not what

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.140 
stitches in the middle which is not what
people<00:06:27.480> would<00:06:27.870> consider<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.470> normal<00:06:29.150> tables

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
people would consider the normal tables

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.710 
people would consider the normal tables
I<00:06:30.300> guess<00:06:31.670> usually<00:06:32.670> the<00:06:32.760> cables<00:06:33.120> are<00:06:33.270> next<00:06:33.660> to

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
I guess usually the cables are next to

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.640 
I guess usually the cables are next to
each<00:06:33.780> other<00:06:33.900> and<00:06:35.030> they're<00:06:36.030> just<00:06:36.210> crossed

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
each other and they're just crossed

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.290 
each other and they're just crossed
whereas<00:06:37.650> I've<00:06:37.950> put<00:06:38.190> in<00:06:38.310> extra<00:06:38.640> rows<00:06:38.940> to<00:06:39.270> make

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
whereas I've put in extra rows to make

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.230 
whereas I've put in extra rows to make
it<00:06:39.680> extra<00:06:40.680> stretching<00:06:41.130> so<00:06:41.790> that<00:06:41.970> you<00:06:42.150> know

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
it extra stretching so that you know

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.350 
it extra stretching so that you know
slippers<00:06:42.750> they<00:06:43.170> get<00:06:43.290> caught<00:06:43.530> on<00:06:43.560> stuff<00:06:44.010> I<00:06:44.400> just

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
slippers they get caught on stuff I just

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.210 
slippers they get caught on stuff I just
don't<00:06:45.810> want<00:06:46.020> them<00:06:47.630> be<00:06:48.630> too<00:06:48.840> tight<00:06:49.080> and<00:06:49.950> I

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
don't want them be too tight and I

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.150 
don't want them be too tight and I
usually<00:06:50.370> am<00:06:50.640> a<00:06:50.670> very<00:06:50.940> tight<00:06:51.210> knitter<00:06:51.650> so<00:06:52.650> there

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
usually am a very tight knitter so there

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.820 
usually am a very tight knitter so there
you<00:06:53.310> have<00:06:53.340> it<00:06:53.520> those<00:06:54.510> are<00:06:55.790> how<00:06:56.790> to<00:06:56.850> move<00:06:57.830> rows

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
you have it those are how to move rows

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.860 
you have it those are how to move rows
and<00:07:00.440> fYI<00:07:01.440> each<00:07:02.340> one<00:07:02.670> of<00:07:02.820> these<00:07:03.000> has<00:07:03.420> its<00:07:03.450> own

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
and fYI each one of these has its own

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.200 
and fYI each one of these has its own
color<00:07:04.140> on<00:07:04.770> a<00:07:06.230> what<00:07:07.230> they<00:07:07.380> call<00:07:07.410> a<00:07:07.590> bobbin<00:07:08.210> this

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
color on a what they call a bobbin this

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.890 
color on a what they call a bobbin this
thing<00:07:09.800> so<00:07:10.800> I<00:07:10.860> have<00:07:11.490> one<00:07:12.180> two<00:07:12.540> three<00:07:13.500> four

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
thing so I have one two three four

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.950 
thing so I have one two three four
bobbins<00:07:15.900> for<00:07:16.110> each<00:07:16.230> color<00:07:16.560> for<00:07:17.340> each<00:07:17.430> sock

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
bobbins for each color for each sock

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.840 
bobbins for each color for each sock
which<00:07:18.960> means<00:07:19.200> I<00:07:19.260> had<00:07:19.440> eight<00:07:19.680> bobbins<00:07:20.190> going

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
which means I had eight bobbins going

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.140 
which means I had eight bobbins going
across<00:07:21.140> the<00:07:22.140> entire<00:07:22.230> time<00:07:23.060> definitely<00:07:24.060> not

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
across the entire time definitely not

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.930 
across the entire time definitely not
something<00:07:24.420> you<00:07:24.600> want<00:07:24.780> to<00:07:24.840> rush<00:07:25.790> when<00:07:26.790> you're

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
something you want to rush when you're

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.660 
something you want to rush when you're
doing<00:07:27.180> it<00:07:28.040> because<00:07:29.040> you<00:07:29.220> will<00:07:29.340> make<00:07:29.550> a<00:07:29.580> mistake

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670 
doing it because you will make a mistake
