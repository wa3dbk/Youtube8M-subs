I was saying I've been writing for

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.360 
I was saying I've been writing for
liquid<00:00:06.120> force<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.689> we<00:00:06.779> were<00:00:06.899> trying<00:00:07.110> to<00:00:07.560> get

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
liquid force and we were trying to get

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.610 
liquid force and we were trying to get
involved<00:00:08.760> into<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.299> board<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.870> create<00:00:10.260> like

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
involved into this board and create like

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.020 
involved into this board and create like
it<00:00:10.920> may<00:00:11.639> be<00:00:11.670> some<00:00:11.820> new<00:00:12.150> board<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.790> yeah<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
it may be some new board and yeah the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.490 
it may be some new board and yeah the
last<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.360> years<00:00:15.509> we've<00:00:15.750> been<00:00:15.900> creating<00:00:16.049> this

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
last two years we've been creating this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800 
last two years we've been creating this
board<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.369> skim<00:00:17.610> style<00:00:17.910> board<00:00:18.180> there's

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
board it's a skim style board there's

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.599 
board it's a skim style board there's
two<00:00:18.990> different<00:00:19.230> things<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.160> wakesurfing

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
two different things now in wakesurfing

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
two different things now in wakesurfing
the<00:00:20.880> absurd<00:00:21.240> style<00:00:21.600> board<00:00:21.840> look<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.439> more

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the absurd style board look like more

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.230 
the absurd style board look like more
like<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.830> surf<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> ocean<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.029> bigger
