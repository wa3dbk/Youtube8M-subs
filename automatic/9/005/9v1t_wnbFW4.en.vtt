00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
give you a little bit of tutorial in the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
give you a little bit of tutorial in the
early<00:00:46.710> levels<00:00:47.010> obviously<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> spring<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
early levels obviously use a spring to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
early levels obviously use a spring to
push<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.289> ball<00:00:49.649> screwed<00:00:50.160> pieces<00:00:50.640> cannot<00:00:50.879> be

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
push the ball screwed pieces cannot be

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
push the ball screwed pieces cannot be
moved<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:52.079> my<00:00:52.289> spring<00:00:52.620> they're

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
moved so there's my spring they're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
moved so there's my spring they're
telling<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> where<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> move<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> tap<00:00:54.360> on

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
telling you where to move it to tap on

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.010 
telling you where to move it to tap on
there<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.620> slider<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.840> your

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
there and it's a slider game to get your

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.950 
there and it's a slider game to get your
spring<00:00:58.410> into<00:00:59.190> place<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> then<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
spring into place and then when you do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.509 
spring into place and then when you do
you<00:01:01.410> tap<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> lower<00:01:02.370> left<00:01:02.760> play<00:01:03.270> button<00:01:03.660> boom

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
you tap the lower left play button boom

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.219 
you tap the lower left play button boom
it<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.670> works<00:01:05.909> magically<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.200> look

up their looks you have a number of
balls<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> number<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> moves<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
balls and you have a number of moves the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.109 
balls and you have a number of moves the
moves<00:01:11.390> don't<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.510> anything<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:14.119> take

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
moves don't do anything but they take

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
moves don't do anything but they take
away<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:15.600> points<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> balls<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
only have X amount you can change those

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
only have X amount you can change those
in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> settings<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.369> let's<00:01:20.580> keep<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
got a hundred points that's the most

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.320 
got a hundred points that's the most
points<00:01:22.950> I've<00:01:23.040> ever<00:01:23.189> gotten<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.610> their<00:01:23.850> use

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
points I've ever gotten on their use

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.149 
points I've ever gotten on their use
fans<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.810> blow<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> ball<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.770> again<00:01:25.890> you're

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
fans to blow the ball then again you're

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
fans to blow the ball then again you're
trying<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> least<00:01:27.630> number<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
trying to do this in the least number of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
trying to do this in the least number of
moves<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> 10<00:01:28.770> balls<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.460> 0<00:01:29.670> move

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
moves i have 10 balls and i have 0 move

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
moves i have 10 balls and i have 0 move
so<00:01:30.090> far<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.840> let's<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.290> i<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
so far so let's see if i can do it in

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.899 
so far so let's see if i can do it in
the<00:01:32.159> least<00:01:32.340> number<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> moves<00:01:34.220> possible<00:01:37.880> now<00:01:38.880> i

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the least number of moves possible now i

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
the least number of moves possible now i
forgot<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> fan<00:01:40.049> went<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:41.189> i'm

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
forgot where the fan went but i'm

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.319 
forgot where the fan went but i'm
guessing<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.720> hope<00:01:43.670> boom<00:01:44.670> so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
guessing it's right there I hope boom so
