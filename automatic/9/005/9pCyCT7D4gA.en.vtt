ah

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.480 

as<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.500> general<00:00:24.920> rule<00:00:25.840> we<00:00:26.840> tried<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.230> stick<00:00:27.529> to

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
as a general rule we tried to stick to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.729 
as a general rule we tried to stick to
the<00:00:28.610> art<00:00:28.820> any<00:00:29.360> time<00:00:29.599> we<00:00:29.750> could<00:00:31.000> there<00:00:32.000> were

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
the art any time we could there were

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.869 
the art any time we could there were
things<00:00:33.739> here<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.160> there<00:00:34.309> that<00:00:34.579> sometimes

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
things here and there that sometimes

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.490 
things here and there that sometimes
made<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:35.360> impossible<00:00:35.600> if<00:00:36.020> we<00:00:36.170> were<00:00:36.260> going<00:00:36.410> to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
made that impossible if we were going to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.680 
made that impossible if we were going to
tell<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:37.010> story<00:00:37.879> that<00:00:38.180> wouldn't<00:00:38.420> take<00:00:38.480> the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
tell a story that wouldn't take the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.869 
tell a story that wouldn't take the
viewer<00:00:38.960> out<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.500> picture<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:40.550> can<00:00:40.699> have

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
viewer out of the picture you can have

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.329 
viewer out of the picture you can have
it<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.540> art<00:00:41.720> going<00:00:42.110> from<00:00:42.379> side<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.590> side<00:00:42.890> up

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
it to the art going from side to side up

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.310 
it to the art going from side to side up
and<00:00:43.460> down<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.000> if<00:00:44.089> if<00:00:44.480> somebody<00:00:44.690> turns<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:45.140> head

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
and down but if if somebody turns a head

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.259 
and down but if if somebody turns a head
it<00:00:45.530> turns<00:00:45.710> around<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.370> mean<00:00:46.580> that's<00:00:46.760> we<00:00:47.089> can't

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
it turns around I mean that's we can't

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.110 
it turns around I mean that's we can't
do<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.960> 2d<00:00:48.620> plane<00:00:48.680> just<00:00:49.129> breaks<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
do that the 2d plane just breaks so the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.520 
do that the 2d plane just breaks so the
illusion<00:00:50.300> breaks<00:00:50.660> simple<00:00:51.199> things<00:00:51.350> like<00:00:51.440> a

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
illusion breaks simple things like a

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.710 
illusion breaks simple things like a
head<00:00:51.800> turn<00:00:51.980> or<00:00:52.250> someone<00:00:52.760> walking<00:00:52.910> from<00:00:53.329> point

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
head turn or someone walking from point

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.289 
head turn or someone walking from point
A<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.839> point<00:00:53.930> B<00:00:54.140> within<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.769> frame<00:00:55.299> became

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
A to point B within a frame became

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.229 
A to point B within a frame became
nearly<00:00:56.540> impossible<00:00:57.699> working<00:00:58.699> with<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.970> 2d

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
nearly impossible working with the 2d

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.359 
nearly impossible working with the 2d
art<00:00:59.420> so<00:00:59.659> we<00:00:59.750> would<00:00:59.869> have<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.290> create<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.650> 3d

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
art so we would have to create a 3d

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.710 
art so we would have to create a 3d
character<00:01:01.519> that<00:01:01.850> could<00:01:02.059> either<00:01:02.299> turn<00:01:02.540> his

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
character that could either turn his

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.899 
character that could either turn his
head<00:01:02.869> or<00:01:03.049> move<00:01:03.559> across<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.549> frame

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.870 

because<00:01:08.719> you<00:01:08.960> stopped<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.770> hour<00:01:13.039> arrives

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
because you stopped so the hour arrives

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.260 
because you stopped so the hour arrives
3d<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> whole<00:01:15.310> different<00:01:16.310> beast<00:01:16.399> everything

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
3d is a whole different beast everything

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.809 
3d is a whole different beast everything
is<00:01:17.560> built<00:01:18.560> from<00:01:18.619> scratch<00:01:18.979> we<00:01:19.340> have<00:01:19.460> models

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
is built from scratch we have models

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.870 
is built from scratch we have models
that<00:01:20.000> are<00:01:20.090> built<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:22.009> there's<00:01:22.250> also<00:01:22.369> two<00:01:22.579> just

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
that are built and there's also two just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.520 
that are built and there's also two just
trying<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.149> integrate<00:01:23.329> our<00:01:23.569> two<00:01:23.869> our<00:01:24.079> 3d<00:01:24.409> with

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
trying to integrate our two our 3d with

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.859 
trying to integrate our two our 3d with
a<00:01:24.560> 2d<00:01:24.890> there's<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.700> certain<00:01:25.939> grain<00:01:26.299> there's<00:01:26.840> a

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
a 2d there's a certain grain there's a

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.010 
a 2d there's a certain grain there's a
certain<00:01:27.109> color<00:01:27.490> palette<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.520> what<00:01:28.849> he<00:01:29.539> saw<00:01:29.750> did

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
certain color palette to what he saw did

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.020 
certain color palette to what he saw did
and<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:30.829> was<00:01:31.009> tricky<00:01:31.250> trying<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.640> come<00:01:31.789> up<00:01:31.819> with

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
and it was tricky trying to come up with

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.190 
and it was tricky trying to come up with
a<00:01:32.060> different<00:01:32.270> combination<00:01:32.539> of<00:01:32.869> things<00:01:33.020> that

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
a different combination of things that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.099 
a different combination of things that
made<00:01:33.500> our<00:01:33.709> 3d<00:01:34.250> not<00:01:34.490> stick<00:01:35.030> out<00:01:35.149> too<00:01:35.719> bad<00:01:35.899> from

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
made our 3d not stick out too bad from

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.169 
made our 3d not stick out too bad from
the<00:01:36.259> art<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.619> it's<00:01:37.280> not<00:01:37.429> seamless<00:01:37.819> but<00:01:38.030> it's

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
the art it's it's not seamless but it's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.419 
the art it's it's not seamless but it's
as<00:01:38.479> close<00:01:38.719> as<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:39.500> were<00:01:39.590> able<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.770> find<00:01:40.099> for

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
as close as we were able to find for

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.039 
as close as we were able to find for
this<00:01:40.549> project<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:41.270> sometimes<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:41.959> were

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
this project and sometimes there were

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.109 
this project and sometimes there were
backgrounds<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:43.159> know<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.489> had<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.879> sort

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
backgrounds that you know we had to sort

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.080 
backgrounds that you know we had to sort
of<00:01:44.239> create<00:01:44.719> or<00:01:45.289> recreate<00:01:45.770> or<00:01:46.489> piece<00:01:46.849> together

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
of create or recreate or piece together

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.660 
of create or recreate or piece together
based<00:01:47.569> on<00:01:47.719> other<00:01:47.989> art<00:01:48.319> yeah<00:01:49.039> that's<00:01:49.250> definite

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
based on other art yeah that's definite

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.249 
based on other art yeah that's definite
in<00:01:49.819> a<00:01:49.879> comic<00:01:50.239> they<00:01:50.329> do<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.719> got<00:01:50.869> an<00:01:50.929> artist

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
in a comic they do that got an artist

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.699 
in a comic they do that got an artist
will<00:01:51.409> paint<00:01:51.679> out<00:01:52.149> paint<00:01:53.149> in<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.539> set<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.170> then

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
will paint out paint in a set and then

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.440 
will paint out paint in a set and then
in<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.920> other<00:01:55.099> panels<00:01:55.520> after<00:01:55.819> that<00:01:55.969> it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
in the other panels after that it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.419 
in the other panels after that it
doesn't<00:01:56.869> because<00:01:57.289> it's<00:01:57.679> already<00:01:57.860> implied<00:01:58.280> the

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
doesn't because it's already implied the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.949 
doesn't because it's already implied the
best<00:01:58.610> way<00:01:58.759> they<00:01:58.909> look<00:01:59.090> at<00:01:59.209> that's<00:01:59.420> where<00:01:59.599> the

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
best way they look at that's where the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.289 
best way they look at that's where the
action<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.349> taking<00:02:00.679> place<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:01.819> felt<00:02:02.090> as

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
action is taking place and we felt as

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.849 
action is taking place and we felt as
we're<00:02:02.479> trying<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.750> take<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.140> towards<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.649> more

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
we're trying to take this towards a more

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.759 
we're trying to take this towards a more
cinematic<00:02:04.509> filmic<00:02:05.509> look<00:02:05.539> that<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.439> couldn't

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:06.769 
cinematic filmic look that we couldn't

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:08.859 
cinematic filmic look that we couldn't
just<00:02:06.979> hop<00:02:07.399> out<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.609> our<00:02:07.849> sets<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.329> that<00:02:08.390> so

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
just hop out of our sets like that so

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.080 
just hop out of our sets like that so
we've<00:02:09.019> had<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.440> work<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.340> try<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.549> recreate<00:02:10.879> our

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
we've had to work to try to recreate our

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.050 
we've had to work to try to recreate our
sets<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.290> from<00:02:12.920> opposite<00:02:13.489> angles<00:02:13.849> so

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
sets and from opposite angles so

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.430 
sets and from opposite angles so
sometimes<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:14.660> were<00:02:14.780> able<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.019> find<00:02:15.230> other

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
sometimes we were able to find other

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.339 
sometimes we were able to find other
panels<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.370> comic<00:02:16.639> book<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.090> reuse

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
panels in the comic book to just reuse

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.140 
panels in the comic book to just reuse
sometimes<00:02:18.349> we<00:02:18.500> had<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.709> project<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.700> art

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
sometimes we had to project that art

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.599 
sometimes we had to project that art
onto<00:02:20.720> 3d<00:02:21.049> set<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.590> rotate<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> around<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
onto 3d set and rotate it around and

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.849 
onto 3d set and rotate it around and
repaint<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:24.319> basically<00:02:24.590> what<00:02:24.769> we're

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
repaint in but basically what we're

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.099 
repaint in but basically what we're
trying<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.130> do<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.669> keep<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.569> audience

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
trying to do is to keep the audience

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.420 
trying to do is to keep the audience
from<00:02:27.349> looking<00:02:27.680> at<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.919> and<00:02:27.980> say<00:02:28.099> well<00:02:28.250> what

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
from looking at it and say well what

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.309 
from looking at it and say well what
just<00:02:28.609> happened<00:02:28.940> your<00:02:29.299> viewer<00:02:29.810> would<00:02:30.049> sort<00:02:30.290> of

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
just happened your viewer would sort of

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.990 
just happened your viewer would sort of
lose<00:02:30.560> all<00:02:30.769> sense<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.130> perspective<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.790> where

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
lose all sense of perspective and where

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.390 
lose all sense of perspective and where
they<00:02:32.150> were<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.569> three-dimensional<00:02:33.319> space<00:02:33.400> so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
they were in three-dimensional space so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.970 
they were in three-dimensional space so
that<00:02:34.849> was<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.239> pretty<00:02:35.780> big<00:02:35.989> job<00:02:36.590> for<00:02:36.919> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
that was a pretty big job for the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.970 
that was a pretty big job for the
compositors<00:02:37.519> was<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.349> artist<00:02:39.829> to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
compositors was and and the artist to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.180 
compositors was and and the artist to
define<00:02:40.700> those<00:02:40.910> elements<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.130> sort<00:02:43.130> of

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
define those elements and sort of

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.509 
define those elements and sort of
recreate<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.380> know<00:02:45.500> would<00:02:45.919> be<00:02:46.099> at<00:02:46.190> Loki's

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
recreate the you know would be at Loki's

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.289 
recreate the you know would be at Loki's
bedroom<00:02:47.030> or<00:02:47.919> whatever<00:02:48.919> it<00:02:49.069> was<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.030> it's

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.240 
bedroom or whatever it was but it's it's
a<00:02:50.389> constant<00:02:50.870> process<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:51.709> found<00:02:51.919> out<00:02:52.069> things

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
a constant process we found out things

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.190 
a constant process we found out things
an<00:02:52.489> issue<00:02:52.609> for<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.299> making<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> look<00:02:53.989> better

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
an issue for of making a look better

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.690 
an issue for of making a look better
that<00:02:54.349> we<00:02:54.470> hadn't<00:02:54.709> figured<00:02:54.980> out<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.340> two<00:02:55.549> or

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that we hadn't figured out in two or

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.480 
that we hadn't figured out in two or
three

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.460 

so<00:03:00.490> Marco<00:03:00.850> took<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.080> more<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
so Marco took on the more the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.830 
so Marco took on the more the
pre-production<00:03:03.130> side<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.880> defining<00:03:04.210> what

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
pre-production side and defining what

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.320 
pre-production side and defining what
the<00:03:04.990> initial<00:03:05.350> step<00:03:05.650> from<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.880> comic<00:03:07.180> book

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
the initial step from the comic book

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.940 
the initial step from the comic book
page<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:08.380> an<00:03:08.800> animated<00:03:09.370> form<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.210> storytelling

page to an animated form of storytelling

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.880 
page to an animated form of storytelling
what<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.130> boiled<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:14.410> would<00:03:14.740> get

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
what that boiled down to is I would get

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
what that boiled down to is I would get
the<00:03:14.980> voiceover<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.820> would<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.660> sent<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.050> us

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the voiceover that would be sent to us

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.210 
the voiceover that would be sent to us

from James Snyder at edge studio New
York<00:03:21.430> who<00:03:21.670> handled<00:03:22.120> all<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.990> voice

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
York who handled all of the voice

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.560 
York who handled all of the voice
casting<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:25.050> recording<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.360> I<00:03:31.450> would

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
casting and recording and then I would

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.770 
casting and recording and then I would
take<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.170> then<00:03:32.440> take<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.780> already

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
take that and then take the the already

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.850 
take that and then take the the already
scanned<00:03:35.170> in<00:03:35.460> our<00:03:36.460> panels<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.180> everything

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
scanned in our panels and everything

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.670 
scanned in our panels and everything
time<00:03:38.860> every<00:03:39.550> shot<00:03:39.790> outs<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:41.080> have

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
time every shot outs so that I have

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.100 
time every shot outs so that I have
basically<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.250> rough<00:03:42.520> cut<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.000> we<00:03:43.810> knew<00:03:43.930> how

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
basically a rough cut and we knew how

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.620 
basically a rough cut and we knew how
many<00:03:44.290> shots<00:03:44.470> we<00:03:45.430> were<00:03:45.490> gonna<00:03:45.670> have<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.330> then

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
many shots we were gonna have and then

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.900 
many shots we were gonna have and then
how<00:03:46.840> long<00:03:47.110> each<00:03:47.140> shot<00:03:47.650> was<00:03:47.830> gonna<00:03:47.920> be<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.490> then

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
how long each shot was gonna be and then

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.090 
how long each shot was gonna be and then
we<00:03:49.030> would<00:03:49.180> get<00:03:49.270> together<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.900> decide<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.740> what

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
we would get together and decide on what

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.890 
we would get together and decide on what
worked<00:03:51.310> what<00:03:51.490> didn't<00:03:51.790> work<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.090> how<00:03:52.300> from

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
worked what didn't work and how from

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.510 
worked what didn't work and how from
there<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.260> move<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.560> there's<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.250> lot<00:03:54.400> of

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
there to move on there's a lot of

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.970 
there to move on there's a lot of
logistics<00:03:55.030> involved<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:56.530> because<00:03:56.860> of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
logistics involved just because of

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.950 
logistics involved just because of
timeline<00:03:57.460> we<00:03:57.760> may<00:03:57.940> not<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.330> time<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.600> do<00:03:58.810> this

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
timeline we may not have time to do this

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.729 
timeline we may not have time to do this
character<00:03:59.440> as<00:03:59.590> 3d<00:04:00.040> versus<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.210> know

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
character as 3d versus you know

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.650 
character as 3d versus you know
something<00:04:02.739> else<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.910> becomes<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.450> it

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
something else so it becomes a it

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.540 
something else so it becomes a it
becomes<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.050> big<00:04:05.200> juggling<00:04:05.620> act<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.190> then<00:04:06.430> I

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
becomes a big juggling act and then I

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.940 
becomes a big juggling act and then I
would<00:04:06.730> go<00:04:06.880> back<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.709> handle<00:04:08.709> more<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
would go back in and handle more of the

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.910 
would go back in and handle more of the
production<00:04:09.370> side<00:04:09.550> who<00:04:09.940> was<00:04:10.120> working<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.600> what

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
production side who was working on what

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.220 
production side who was working on what
and<00:04:11.920> from<00:04:12.700> there<00:04:12.910> making<00:04:13.510> sure<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.900> every

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
and from there making sure that every

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
trying to make things work I mean this

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.120 
trying to make things work I mean this
this<00:05:03.729> way<00:05:04.030> of<00:05:04.300> taking<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.199> comic<00:05:05.500> book<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.919> a

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
this way of taking a comic book to a

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.189 
this way of taking a comic book to a
different<00:05:06.490> medium<00:05:06.699> it's<00:05:07.389> it's<00:05:07.780> tough<00:05:08.020> we're

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
different medium it's it's tough we're

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.900 
different medium it's it's tough we're
still<00:05:08.410> experimenting<00:05:08.949> and<00:05:09.310> figuring<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:09.789> out

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
still experimenting and figuring it out

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.790 
still experimenting and figuring it out
and<00:05:10.449> there<00:05:10.780> were<00:05:10.840> times<00:05:11.080> we<00:05:11.199> work<00:05:11.410> on<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> shot

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
and there were times we work on a shot

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.499 
and there were times we work on a shot
and<00:05:12.070> make<00:05:12.250> it<00:05:12.370> all<00:05:12.490> through<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.759> process<00:05:12.910> and

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
and make it all through the process and

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.180 
and make it all through the process and
we<00:05:13.690> look<00:05:13.870> at<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.229> think<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:14.590> just<00:05:14.680> not

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
we look at it I think it's just not

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.340 
we look at it I think it's just not
quite<00:05:15.460> working<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.419> so<00:05:16.660> trying<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:16.990> you

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
quite working and and so trying to you

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.930 
quite working and and so trying to you
know<00:05:17.380> figure<00:05:17.680> out<00:05:17.830> how<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.160> juggle<00:05:18.580> things

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
know figure out how to juggle things

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.740 
know figure out how to juggle things
like<00:05:19.180> that

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
like that

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.270 
like that
in<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:20.080> amount<00:05:20.289> of<00:05:20.320> time<00:05:20.440> without<00:05:20.620> having<00:05:21.009> to

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
in the amount of time without having to

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.180 
in the amount of time without having to
recreate<00:05:21.910> everything<00:05:22.979> so<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.100> was

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
recreate everything so that was

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.129 
recreate everything so that was
frustrating<00:05:24.729> but<00:05:24.820> there<00:05:24.970> were<00:05:25.060> times<00:05:25.330> when<00:05:25.600> we

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
frustrating but there were times when we

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.990 
frustrating but there were times when we
thought<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.130> was<00:05:27.220> gonna<00:05:27.400> work<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:27.820> we

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
thought that it was gonna work and we

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.520 
thought that it was gonna work and we
made<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.180> through<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:28.780> then<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.050> end<00:05:29.199> result

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
made it through and then the end result

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.980 
made it through and then the end result
was<00:05:29.620> great<00:05:29.800> sometimes<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:31.000> most<00:05:31.240> frustrating

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
was great sometimes the most frustrating

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.779 
was great sometimes the most frustrating
moments<00:05:32.350> became<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.770> most<00:05:32.949> gratifying<00:05:33.400> I

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
moments became the most gratifying I

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.129 
moments became the most gratifying I
think<00:05:34.090> we<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:36.340> told<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:36.699> story<00:05:36.940> that's<00:05:37.300> not<00:05:38.080> a

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
think we we told a story that's not a

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.529 
think we we told a story that's not a
lot<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:38.949> big<00:05:39.190> explosions<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.150> not<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> lot<00:05:40.510> of

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
lot of big explosions and not a lot of

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.680
