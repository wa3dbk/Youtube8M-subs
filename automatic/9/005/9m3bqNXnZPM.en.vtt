but just in case you don't there's links
in<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.160> description<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.820> there's<00:00:38.570> also<00:00:38.750> a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
in the description and there's also a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.720 
in the description and there's also a
ton<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.200> YouTube<00:00:39.500> videos<00:00:40.010> showing<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:40.489> hyper

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
ton of YouTube videos showing you hyper

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.210 
ton of YouTube videos showing you hyper
spin<00:00:41.090> as<00:00:41.300> well<00:00:41.480> as<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.630> dolphin<00:00:41.900> emulator<00:00:42.220> right

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
spin as well as a dolphin emulator right

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.860 
spin as well as a dolphin emulator right
now<00:00:43.430> hyper<00:00:43.850> spin<00:00:44.150> does<00:00:44.300> not<00:00:44.510> officially

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
now hyper spin does not officially

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.350 
now hyper spin does not officially
support<00:00:45.590> Wii<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.070> that's<00:00:46.730> because<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.239> Wii

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
support Wii and that's because the Wii

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.540 
support Wii and that's because the Wii
is<00:00:47.480> still<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> current<00:00:48.140> gen<00:00:48.350> system<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.430> it's

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
is still a current gen system so it's

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.700 
is still a current gen system so it's
understandable<00:00:50.090> but<00:00:50.600> I've<00:00:51.080> decided<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.620> go

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
understandable but I've decided to go

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.950 
understandable but I've decided to go
ahead<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.010> make<00:00:52.129> my<00:00:52.160> own<00:00:52.309> thing<00:00:52.699> anyways<00:00:53.030> so

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
ahead and make my own thing anyways so

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.350 
ahead and make my own thing anyways so
here's<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.530> main<00:00:54.710> wheel<00:00:54.949> it's<00:00:55.940> pretty

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
here's the main wheel it's pretty

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.760 
here's the main wheel it's pretty
standard<00:00:56.629> it's<00:00:56.989> got<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.140> picture<00:00:57.379> of<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.650> Wii

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
standard it's got a picture of the Wii

a video playing and that's how the main

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.960 
a video playing and that's how the main
wheels<00:01:02.570> are<00:01:02.809> for<00:01:03.199> for<00:01:03.620> any<00:01:03.949> system<00:01:04.250> that's<00:01:04.850> a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
wheels are for for any system that's a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.830 
wheels are for for any system that's a
niver<00:01:05.150> spin<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.909> course<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.420> don't<00:01:08.570> have<00:01:08.630> to

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
niver spin of course you don't have to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.940 
niver spin of course you don't have to
watch<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.200> whole<00:01:09.409> thing<00:01:09.620> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.770> always

just go right into the sub wheel so here
we<00:01:13.280> are<00:01:13.310> in<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.610> sub<00:01:13.790> wheel<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.710> right

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840 
and right now I've done about 220 titles
and<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:29.930> lot<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.259> games<00:01:30.500> are<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:31.520> really

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
and a lot of the games are not really

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.160 
and a lot of the games are not really
that<00:01:31.969> good<00:01:32.270> or<00:01:32.479> they're<00:01:32.600> outdated<00:01:32.930> or

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
that good or they're outdated or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.690 
that good or they're outdated or
whatever<00:01:33.409> but<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:33.860> just<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.189> start<00:01:34.430> that's

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
whatever but it's just a start that's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.819 
whatever but it's just a start that's
what<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:34.850> had<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.119> work<00:01:35.270> with<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.530> that's<00:01:36.680> what

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
what I had to work with so that's what

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.600 
what I had to work with so that's what
I've<00:01:36.890> started<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:39.490> unfortunately<00:01:40.490> looks

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
I've started with unfortunately looks

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.130 
I've started with unfortunately looks
like<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.880> top<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.299> bottom<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.719> video<00:01:41.840> got

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
like the top and bottom of the video got

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.410 
like the top and bottom of the video got
cut<00:01:42.320> off<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.500> little<00:01:42.710> bit<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:43.609> that's<00:01:43.789> okay<00:01:43.969> and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
cut off a little bit but that's okay and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.709 
cut off a little bit but that's okay and
on<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.229> right<00:01:45.380> side<00:01:45.409> you've<00:01:45.829> got<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.100> pointer

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
on the right side you've got the pointer

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.209 
on the right side you've got the pointer
most<00:01:47.719> most<00:01:48.320> wheels<00:01:48.590> have<00:01:48.859> their<00:01:49.070> own

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
most most wheels have their own

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.760 
most most wheels have their own
customized<00:01:49.850> pointers<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.840> I've<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.289> I<00:01:51.560> put

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
customized pointers and I've just I put

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.669 
customized pointers and I've just I put
the<00:01:51.890> Wii<00:01:52.490> cursor<00:01:52.969> in<00:01:53.270> there<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.630> think<00:01:54.469> it<00:01:54.530> works

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
the Wii cursor in there I think it works

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.849 
the Wii cursor in there I think it works
pretty<00:01:54.829> well

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
pretty well

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.770 
pretty well
as<00:01:57.859> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.100> see<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.490> bottom<00:01:58.750> you've<00:01:59.750> got

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
as you can see on the bottom you've got

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.419 
as you can see on the bottom you've got
the<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.409> same<00:02:00.590> image<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.070> you'll<00:02:01.189> see<00:02:01.340> in

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
the the same image that you'll see in

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.419 
the the same image that you'll see in
the<00:02:01.460> Wii<00:02:01.640> system<00:02:02.060> menu<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:03.679> on<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.219> TV

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
the Wii system menu and on the TV

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.800 
the Wii system menu and on the TV
there's<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.820> little<00:02:04.969> center<00:02:05.270> bar<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.659> I<00:02:05.719> think

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
there's a little center bar so I think

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.359 
there's a little center bar so I think
it's<00:02:06.049> got<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.649> know<00:02:06.679> pretty<00:02:07.039> good<00:02:07.250> wee

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
it's got a you know pretty good wee

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:25.850 
it's got a you know pretty good wee
theme<00:02:07.670> going<00:02:07.909> on

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.760 

so<00:02:26.860> I've<00:02:26.950> only<00:02:27.100> got<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> few<00:02:27.580> videos<00:02:28.620> right<00:02:29.620> now

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
so I've only got a few videos right now

wants<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.010> help<00:02:39.190> with<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.460> project<00:02:40.380> game

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
wants to help with this project game

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.900 
wants to help with this project game
videos<00:02:41.710> is<00:02:41.920> actually<00:02:42.070> what<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.430> could<00:02:42.640> use<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
videos is actually what I could use the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.070 
videos is actually what I could use the
most<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.850> record<00:02:46.180> good<00:02:46.660> quality

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
most if you can record good quality

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170 
most if you can record good quality
videos<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.740> just<00:02:48.310> upload<00:02:48.610> them<00:02:48.820> somewhere

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
videos and just upload them somewhere

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.330 
videos and just upload them somewhere
that'd<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.320> awesome<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.800> doesn't<00:02:51.070> matter<00:02:51.220> what

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
that'd be awesome it doesn't matter what

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.680 
that'd be awesome it doesn't matter what
format<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.910> they<00:02:52.000> only<00:02:52.120> need<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.330> be<00:02:52.420> about<00:02:52.630> a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
format and they only need to be about a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:14.199 
format and they only need to be about a
minute<00:02:52.960> long<00:02:53.230> each

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.679 

and<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.870> definitely<00:03:15.349> plan<00:03:15.500> adding<00:03:16.129> more<00:03:16.689> more

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
and I definitely plan adding more more

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.089 
and I definitely plan adding more more
images<00:03:18.109> more<00:03:18.349> titles<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:19.189> this<00:03:19.280> project

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
images more titles to this project

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.319 
images more titles to this project
especially<00:03:22.099> newer<00:03:22.280> games<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.819> more<00:03:22.939> popular

all<00:03:50.060> right<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:50.420> we're<00:03:50.570> getting<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> end<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
all right so we're getting to the end of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.600 
all right so we're getting to the end of
the<00:03:51.650> wheel<00:03:51.800> here<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.810> recording<00:03:54.230> software

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the wheel here the recording software

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.970 
the wheel here the recording software
just<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.880> makes<00:03:56.210> everything<00:03:56.510> too<00:03:56.780> slow<00:03:57.140> when<00:03:57.950> I

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
just it makes everything too slow when I

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.680 
just it makes everything too slow when I
try<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.250> play<00:03:58.490> a<00:03:58.520> game<00:03:58.790> like<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.090> so<00:03:59.480> what<00:03:59.600> I'm

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
fine and in hyper spin I've got I've got

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.390 
fine and in hyper spin I've got I've got
it<00:05:12.170> set<00:05:12.380> up<00:05:12.500> so<00:05:12.530> that<00:05:12.650> when<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:12.920> push<00:05:13.130> down<00:05:13.370> on

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
it set up so that when I push down on

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.470 
it set up so that when I push down on
the<00:05:13.730> right<00:05:13.880> joystick

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
the right joystick

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.520 
the right joystick
that<00:05:15.380> exits<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.980> game<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:18.080> works<00:05:18.320> fine

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
that exits the game and that works fine

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.460 
that exits the game and that works fine
too<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:20.300> make<00:05:20.480> some<00:05:20.660> emulators<00:05:21.320> have

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
too so I make some emulators have

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.740 
too so I make some emulators have
trouble<00:05:21.830> exiting<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.820> some<00:05:22.970> reason<00:05:23.330> but<00:05:23.570> this

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
trouble exiting for some reason but this

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.770 
trouble exiting for some reason but this
one<00:05:23.900> works<00:05:24.080> fine<00:05:24.170> here<00:05:24.880> see<00:05:25.880> right<00:05:26.480> back<00:05:26.660> to

one works fine here see right back to

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.750 
one works fine here see right back to
