00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
is I use this can't open on my winger

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.160 
is I use this can't open on my winger
has<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.130> really<00:04:40.490> good<00:04:41.420> edge<00:04:41.600> just<00:04:41.840> like<00:04:41.960> that

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
has a really good edge just like that

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.520 
has a really good edge just like that
chisel<00:04:42.560> grind<00:04:42.800> likely<00:04:43.760> owl<00:04:44.420> on<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.750> farmer<00:04:45.290> or

on my Ulster organized without opens up
on<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.340> side<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:52.120> use<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.330> because<00:04:53.540> it's

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
on the side and I use this because it's

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.230 
on the side and I use this because it's
so<00:04:53.870> much<00:04:53.990> shorter<00:04:54.440> such<00:04:55.070> like<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.310> great<00:04:56.060> edge

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
so much shorter such like a great edge

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.020 
so much shorter such like a great edge
on<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.840> lot<00:04:57.410> more<00:04:57.590> control<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.850> don't

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
on it a lot more control and I don't

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.020 
on it a lot more control and I don't
have<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.240> give<00:04:59.360> such<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.660> long<00:04:59.930> quick<00:05:00.860> stroke<00:05:01.280> to

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
have to give such a long quick stroke to

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.730 
have to give such a long quick stroke to
get<00:05:02.180> sparks<00:05:02.600> like<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:03.080> do<00:05:03.140> want<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.350> use<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.530> spine

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
get sparks like I do want to use a spine

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.580 
get sparks like I do want to use a spine
of<00:05:03.860> my<00:05:03.950> knife<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.370> I<00:05:04.730> can<00:05:04.880> still<00:05:05.350> strike<00:05:06.350> the

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
of my knife and I can still strike the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.630 
of my knife and I can still strike the
same<00:05:06.770> way<00:05:06.980> I<00:05:07.600> can<00:05:08.600> hold<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:10.070> can<00:05:10.280> opener<00:05:10.580> and

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
same way I can hold the can opener and

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.850 
same way I can hold the can opener and
pull<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.850> foyer<00:05:11.000> cell<00:05:11.240> towards<00:05:11.540> me<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:11.930> so

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
pull the foyer cell towards me and so

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.720 
pull the foyer cell towards me and so
sparks<00:05:13.430> just<00:05:13.490> fine<00:05:14.410> but<00:05:15.410> cause<00:05:16.130> this<00:05:16.340> goes<00:05:16.520> far

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
sparks just fine but cause this goes far

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.730 
sparks just fine but cause this goes far
so<00:05:16.970> well<00:05:17.180> well<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:17.960> could<00:05:18.140> get<00:05:18.260> with<00:05:18.350> this<00:05:18.500> one

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
so well well I could get with this one

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.930 
so well well I could get with this one
is<00:05:19.060> i'll<00:05:20.060> actually<00:05:20.270> place<00:05:21.490> my<00:05:22.490> fire<00:05:22.700> steel

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
is i'll actually place my fire steel

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.710 
is i'll actually place my fire steel
towards<00:05:23.240> my<00:05:23.330> tender<00:05:24.640> now<00:05:25.640> really<00:05:26.150> bear<00:05:26.690> down

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
towards my tender now really bear down

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.180 
towards my tender now really bear down
on<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:28.430> steel<00:05:28.610> with<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:28.910> edge<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.650> i'll<00:05:30.920> just

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
on the steel with the edge and i'll just

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.620 
on the steel with the edge and i'll just
luckily<00:05:32.350> bend<00:05:33.350> my<00:05:33.500> elbow<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.220> strike<00:05:34.790> i'm

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
luckily bend my elbow and strike i'm

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:43.950 
luckily bend my elbow and strike i'm
just<00:05:35.720> going<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:35.930> turn<00:05:36.050> my<00:05:36.230> wrist

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.260 

and<00:05:44.530> it<00:05:44.620> strikes<00:05:44.830> oh<00:05:45.130> well<00:05:45.400> I<00:05:45.669> just<00:05:45.699> have<00:05:46.180> a

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
and it strikes oh well I just have a

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.020 
and it strikes oh well I just have a
real<00:05:46.509> short<00:05:46.960> push<00:05:47.259> that<00:05:47.919> there's<00:05:48.250> great<00:05:48.639> spark

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
real short push that there's great spark

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.589 
real short push that there's great spark
so<00:05:49.270> there's<00:05:49.419> that<00:05:49.539> short<00:05:49.840> push<00:05:50.080> I<00:05:51.389> really<00:05:52.389> like

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
so there's that short push I really like

00:05:52.599 --> 00:06:06.800 
so there's that short push I really like
that<00:05:53.110> can<00:05:54.099> /<00:05:54.599> it<00:05:55.599> works<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.020> well

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.300 

so<00:06:08.150> those<00:06:09.150> are<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.330> different<00:06:09.930> ways<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.440> strike

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
so those are the different ways I strike

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.930 
so those are the different ways I strike
my<00:06:11.430> fire<00:06:11.610> steel<00:06:13.310> I'll<00:06:14.310> hold<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.580> back<00:06:14.730> of<00:06:14.910> a

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
my fire steel I'll hold the back of a

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.390 
my fire steel I'll hold the back of a
knife<00:06:14.970> and<00:06:15.360> pull<00:06:15.510> towards<00:06:15.840> me<00:06:16.160> so<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.220> don't

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
knife and pull towards me so I don't

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.600 
knife and pull towards me so I don't
throw<00:06:17.520> tender<00:06:17.820> everywhere<00:06:18.180> or<00:06:19.400> I'm<00:06:20.400> using

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
now coming out the side of a pocketknife

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.920 
now coming out the side of a pocketknife
I<00:06:26.060> can<00:06:27.060> just<00:06:27.210> turn<00:06:27.360> my<00:06:27.570> wrist<00:06:27.810> bear<00:06:28.139> down<00:06:28.350> and

I can just turn my wrist bear down and
throw<00:06:30.930> great<00:06:31.080> sparks<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.650> way<00:06:33.560> and<00:06:34.560> I<00:06:34.650> don't

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
throw great sparks that way and I don't

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.129 
throw great sparks that way and I don't
have<00:06:34.980> to<00:06:35.010> push<00:06:35.250> hard<00:06:35.520> or<00:06:35.700> fast<00:06:35.940> or<00:06:36.330> or<00:06:36.480> strong

used to all just use lighter or matches
and<00:06:46.260> just<00:06:46.440> want<00:06:46.590> to<00:06:46.650> learn<00:06:46.710> how<00:06:46.800> to<00:06:46.950> use<00:06:47.130> one<00:06:47.250> of

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
and just want to learn how to use one of

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.710 
and just want to learn how to use one of
these<00:06:47.460> because<00:06:47.700> I<00:06:48.000> mean<00:06:48.210> they're<00:06:48.330> also<00:06:48.419> great

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
these because I mean they're also great

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.570 
these because I mean they're also great
they<00:06:49.410> don't<00:06:49.590> get<00:06:49.740> wet<00:06:49.979> they<00:06:50.160> don't<00:06:50.310> run<00:06:50.400> out<00:06:50.520> of

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
they don't get wet they don't run out of

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.610 
they don't get wet they don't run out of
fluid<00:06:50.940> figure<00:06:51.600> out<00:06:51.660> what<00:06:51.810> it<00:06:52.229> doesn't<00:06:52.500> matter

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
fluid figure out what it doesn't matter

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.980 
fluid figure out what it doesn't matter
they<00:06:52.800> still<00:06:53.040> work<00:06:53.570> then<00:06:54.570> I<00:06:54.750> would<00:06:54.870> suggest

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
they still work then I would suggest

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.800 
they still work then I would suggest
doing<00:06:55.470> it<00:06:55.860> the<00:06:55.979> first<00:06:56.190> way<00:06:56.310> you<00:06:57.210> know<00:06:57.270> until

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
doing it the first way you know until

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.960 
doing it the first way you know until
you<00:06:58.440> get<00:06:58.560> more<00:06:58.740> practice<00:06:58.979> with<00:06:59.520> different

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
you get more practice with different
