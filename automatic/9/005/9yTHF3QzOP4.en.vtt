from<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.540> toshiba<00:00:04.140> satellite<00:00:04.440> ll<00:00:05.310> 500<00:00:06.000> series

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
from a toshiba satellite ll 500 series

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.410 
from a toshiba satellite ll 500 series
first<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> do<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.400> locate<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
first you have to do is locate the the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.030 
first you have to do is locate the the
little<00:00:09.660> slot<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.230> probably<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.830> little

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
little slot it's probably the little

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.400 
little slot it's probably the little
case<00:00:11.360> since<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.599> hard<00:00:12.780> drive<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> lot

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
case since the hard drive is a lot

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.120 
case since the hard drive is a lot
bigger

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
bigger

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.210 
bigger
I'd<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> hard<00:00:15.210> drive<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.590> little<00:00:16.949> slot

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
I'd be the hard drive and a little slot

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.150 
I'd be the hard drive and a little slot
here<00:00:17.520> would<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> RAM<00:00:18.690> which<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.650> located

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
here would be the RAM which is located

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.550 
here would be the RAM which is located
in<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> back<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> middle<00:00:21.170> of<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> hard

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
in the back of the middle of the hard

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.150 
in the back of the middle of the hard
drive<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.490> laptop<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.560> just<00:00:25.560> lower<00:00:25.800> from
