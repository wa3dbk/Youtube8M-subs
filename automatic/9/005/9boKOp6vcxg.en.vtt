find but I've come up with a solution I
watched<00:00:29.189> many<00:00:29.490> tutorials<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> found<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
watched many tutorials and I found this

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.130 
watched many tutorials and I found this
one<00:00:30.890> amazing<00:00:31.890> tutorial<00:00:32.820> which<00:00:33.510> pretty<00:00:33.930> much

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
one amazing tutorial which pretty much

one amazing tutorial which pretty much
gives<00:00:34.500> me<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.920> unlimited<00:00:35.730> source<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.059> oil<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
gives me a unlimited source of oil and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
gives me a unlimited source of oil and
it's<00:00:37.500> solar<00:00:37.950> pack<00:00:39.110> powered<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.790> so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
it's solar pack powered so now it's so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.790 
it's solar pack powered so now it's so
now<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.540> don't<00:00:42.750> need<00:00:42.930> electricity<00:00:43.410> or

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
now you don't need electricity or

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
now you don't need electricity or
anything<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.280> power<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.510> let's<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.690> get

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
anything to power it so let's just get

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
anything to power it so let's just get
started<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.640> glass

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
started first of all you some glass

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.439 
started first of all you some glass
fiber<00:00:48.180> cables<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.640> place<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> sort

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
fiber cables like that place it and sort

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.380 
fiber cables like that place it and sort
of<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> arms<00:00:52.460> corner<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> square<00:00:54.270> I'm

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
of like a arms corner of a square I'm

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.830 
of like a arms corner of a square I'm
guessing<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.680> break<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.820> part<00:00:57.090> put

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
guessing and then break that part put

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
guessing and then break that part put
this<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.870> MSU<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.440> mfsu<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.579> we

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
this here it is a MSU not mfsu there we

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
this here it is a MSU not mfsu there we
go

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
go

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.960 
go
and<00:01:03.000> make<00:01:03.629> sure<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.960> hole<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.680> there

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
and make sure it that hole right there

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.380 
and make sure it that hole right there
like<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.510> sticking<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.610> okay<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.270> all

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
like that is sticking out okay then all

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.440 
like that is sticking out okay then all
you<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.439> high<00:01:11.369> voltage<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you have to do put a high voltage so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
you have to do put a high voltage so
town<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.409> doesn't<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.920> matter

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
town you don't it doesn't really matter

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
town you don't it doesn't really matter
what<00:01:14.340> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.610> solar<00:01:14.760> panel<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.210> use<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
what kind of solar panel you use so I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
what kind of solar panel you use so I
like<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> use<00:01:16.590> high<00:01:16.770> voltage<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.369> much

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
like to use high voltage because much

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
like to use high voltage because much
faster<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
faster see and as you can see it's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
faster see and as you can see it's
already<00:01:20.070> powering<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.320> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
already powering up but then as you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
already powering up but then as you
doing<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.890> place<00:01:23.159> an<00:01:23.340> oil<00:01:23.580> fabricator<00:01:24.119> then

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
doing that place an oil fabricator then

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.300 
doing that place an oil fabricator then
you<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.439> any<00:01:25.799> type<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.570> waterproof<00:01:27.570> pipes

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
you need any type of waterproof pipes

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.590 
you need any type of waterproof pipes
attach<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> oil<00:01:29.850> fabricator<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.420> as

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
attach it to the oil fabricator and as

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.350 
attach it to the oil fabricator and as
you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:32.040> already<00:01:32.340> getting<00:01:32.610> oil

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you can see you're already getting oil

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.230 
you can see you're already getting oil
and<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:33.869> even<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> use<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> pump

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
and you don't even have to use a pump

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
and you don't even have to use a pump
see<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.900> useful<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:39.420> well<00:01:39.840> also<00:01:40.619> all

yeah much better and then you'll need a
redstone<00:04:15.360> engine<00:04:16.910> redstone<00:04:17.910> engine<00:04:18.570> but<00:04:19.500> oh

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
redstone engine redstone engine but oh

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.009 
redstone engine redstone engine but oh
we<00:04:20.100> won't<00:04:20.280> be<00:04:20.400> into<00:04:20.700> glass<00:04:20.880> fibre<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.600> am<00:04:21.870> my

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
we won't be into glass fibre I am my

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.210 
we won't be into glass fibre I am my
friend<00:04:22.289> oh<00:04:23.030> there<00:04:24.030> we<00:04:24.150> go

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.010 

and<00:04:29.220> then<00:04:29.430> you'll<00:04:29.669> need<00:04:30.150> only<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.510> power<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and then you'll need only to power the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.129 
and then you'll need only to power the
Redstone<00:04:31.229> engines<00:04:32.389> but<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.540> power<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:33.990> need

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
Redstone engines but the power you need

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.350 
Redstone engines but the power you need
something<00:04:34.470> red<00:04:34.740> stony<00:04:35.220> I'm<00:04:35.550> guessing<00:04:35.910> like

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
something red stony I'm guessing like

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.740 
something red stony I'm guessing like
that<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:38.220> should<00:04:38.430> start<00:04:38.699> powering<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.540> then

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
that that should start powering and then

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.150 
that that should start powering and then
the<00:04:39.930> oh<00:04:40.430> right<00:04:41.430> there<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:42.410> feel<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.620> this<00:04:43.979> is

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
the oh right there that feel and this is

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.550 
the oh right there that feel and this is
pretty<00:04:44.610> much<00:04:44.729> an<00:04:44.970> unlimited<00:04:45.570> source<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.410> oil

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
pretty much an unlimited source of oil

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.110 
pretty much an unlimited source of oil
