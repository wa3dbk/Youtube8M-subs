00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
it got a little bit excessive and I

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.779

course won the bed but but learnt the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.570 
course won the bed but but learnt the
valuable<00:02:37.440> lesson<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.010> absolutely

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
valuable lesson that is absolutely

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.780 
valuable lesson that is absolutely
unnecessary<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.830> same<00:02:41.040> time<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
unnecessary but at the same time it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
unnecessary but at the same time it
can't<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.300> been<00:02:42.330> easy<00:02:42.590> relearning<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.890> it

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
can't have been easy relearning and it

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
can't have been easy relearning and it
sure<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.670> isn't<00:02:45.000> easy<00:02:45.239> relearning<00:02:45.959> repertory

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
sure it isn't easy relearning repertory

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.570 
sure it isn't easy relearning repertory

arm a different sort of muscle feeling
it's<00:02:54.180> wonderful<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:57.569> course

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it's wonderful to do that of course

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.259 
it's wonderful to do that of course
there's<00:02:58.140> no<00:02:58.380> arm<00:02:58.709> muscle<00:02:59.400> mass<00:02:59.610> memory<00:03:00.030> left

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
did before for the simple reason that I

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.000 
did before for the simple reason that I
can<00:04:54.910> only<00:04:55.180> practice<00:04:55.450> three<00:04:55.900> hours<00:04:56.140> a<00:04:56.170> day<00:04:56.410> or

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
if i was a little bit behind on my

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.300 
if i was a little bit behind on my
practicing<00:05:32.080> well<00:05:32.530> i<00:05:32.590> would<00:05:32.770> just<00:05:32.890> go<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.100> the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
practicing well i would just go to the

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.160 
practicing well i would just go to the
piano<00:05:33.490> and<00:05:33.700> practice<00:05:34.690> seven<00:05:34.990> eight<00:05:35.140> nine

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
hours and get it done and I can't do

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.870 
hours and get it done and I can't do
that<00:05:38.080> anymore<00:05:38.260> so<00:05:38.980> that<00:05:39.130> changes<00:05:39.580> everything

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
that anymore so that changes everything

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.230 
that anymore so that changes everything
and<00:05:40.200> for<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.320> better<00:05:41.730> least<00:05:42.730> I<00:05:42.820> look<00:05:43.000> at<00:05:43.120> it

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
and for the better least I look at it

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.080 
and for the better least I look at it
that<00:05:43.390> way<00:05:43.420> because<00:05:44.290> now<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.860> takes<00:05:45.070> me<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.460> have

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
that way because now it takes me I have

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.300 
that way because now it takes me I have
longer<00:05:46.540> periods<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:46.930> time<00:05:46.990> thinking<00:05:47.920> about

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
longer periods of time thinking about

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.910 
longer periods of time thinking about
the<00:05:49.150> pieces<00:05:49.480> that<00:05:49.510> I'm<00:05:49.720> playing<00:05:49.990> instead<00:05:50.770> of
