you're actually starting to see the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
you're actually starting to see the
color<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.489> honestly<00:01:02.910> didn't<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:04.350> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
color and I honestly didn't think that I

few months and then I'm gonna see the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.630 
few months and then I'm gonna see the
color<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.240> no<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.130> completely
