00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.450 
say on that little half step slide when
you're<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:58.990> five<00:01:59.259> chord<00:01:59.619> going<00:01:59.890> down<00:02:00.100> to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
you're on the five chord going down to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.169 
you're on the five chord going down to
the<00:02:00.490> four<00:02:01.439> throw<00:02:02.439> that<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.740> there<00:02:02.859> my<00:02:03.250> then

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
the four throw that in there my then

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.959 
the four throw that in there my then
flat<00:02:04.600> five<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.619> then<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.829> four<00:02:06.100> chord<00:02:06.429> so

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
flat five and then the four chord so

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.509 
flat five and then the four chord so
again<00:02:07.270> at<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.569> half<00:02:07.780> step<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.440> then<00:02:09.220> maybe

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
again at that half step and then maybe

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.850 
again at that half step and then maybe
on<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.789> 13th<00:02:10.239> cord<00:02:10.539> i'll<00:02:10.629> do<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.780> walk<00:02:11.050> down<00:02:11.319> so

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
on the 13th cord i'll do a walk down so

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.850 
on the 13th cord i'll do a walk down so
on<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.099> 13th<00:02:12.780> go<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> thirteenth<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.769> go

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
on the 13th go a thirteenth and just go

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.800 
on the 13th go a thirteenth and just go
down<00:02:14.890> half<00:02:15.610> steps<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.340> get<00:02:18.549> to<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.819> 13<00:02:19.480> g

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
down half steps so you get to a 13 g

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.270 
down half steps so you get to a 13 g
sharp<00:02:20.080> 13th<00:02:20.700> g<00:02:21.700> 13<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.019> I've<00:02:23.170> sharp<00:02:23.440> 13th<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
sharp 13th g 13 and I've sharp 13th that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.800 
sharp 13th g 13 and I've sharp 13th that
kind<00:02:27.459> hit<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.670> root<00:02:27.849> note<00:02:28.030> first<00:02:28.239> boom<00:02:28.540> bop

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
kind hit the root note first boom bop

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.630 
kind hit the root note first boom bop
bop<00:02:29.290> Boop<00:02:29.620> em<00:02:30.090> ok<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.780> um<00:02:32.650> let's<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> little

of feel and what I'm doing there and
maybe<00:02:43.269> I'll<00:02:43.420> change<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.870> strum<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.470> one

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
maybe I'll change the strum up but one

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.470 
maybe I'll change the strum up but one
of<00:02:45.340> those<00:02:45.430> I'm<00:02:45.610> hitting<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.879> high<00:02:46.030> strings

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
of those I'm hitting the high strings

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.500 
of those I'm hitting the high strings
top<00:02:46.840> three<00:02:47.079> strings<00:02:47.349> first<00:02:48.209> then<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.360> root

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
top three strings first then the root

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.309 
top three strings first then the root
note<00:02:49.720> down<00:02:50.049> down<00:02:50.620> down<00:02:51.040> I'm<00:02:51.549> down<00:02:51.790> them<00:02:52.090> no<00:02:52.840> no

we'll just go like a one the four and
then<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.740> five<00:03:07.040> chord<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:08.570> could<00:03:08.690> do

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
then the five chord and you could do

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.810 
then the five chord and you could do
this<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:08.960> any<00:03:09.170> key<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.680> practice<00:03:10.580> if<00:03:10.730> you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
this in any key and practice if you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.860 
this in any key and practice if you
don't<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.270> fingering<00:03:11.630> for<00:03:11.720> those

don't have the fingering for those

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.230 
don't have the fingering for those
chords<00:03:12.260> down<00:03:12.410> practice<00:03:12.950> them<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:14.090> all

chords down practice them and get all

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240 
chords down practice them and get all
the<00:03:14.360> notes<00:03:14.510> during<00:03:14.750> true<00:03:15.140> especially<00:03:15.860> that

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250

it just practice it and a little bit of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.490 
it just practice it and a little bit of
day<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.640> you'll<00:03:25.880> have<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.170> we<00:03:27.200> play

day and you'll have it so if we play

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.880 
day and you'll have it so if we play
this<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.190> I'll<00:03:28.400> mix<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.760> strum<00:03:29.030> up<00:03:29.710> let's<00:03:30.710> go

this and I'll mix the strum up let's go

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.510 
this and I'll mix the strum up let's go
145<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.120> let's<00:03:32.330> do<00:03:32.630> like<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.260> 12<00:03:33.590> bar<00:03:33.890> will<00:03:34.250> spend

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
145 so let's do like a 12 bar will spend

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.780 
145 so let's do like a 12 bar will spend
more<00:03:34.790> barzani<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:37.090> 13-2<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.420> D<00:03:39.460> 92<00:03:40.460> on<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.670> a
