all interlinked so don't think of your
muscles<00:01:16.710> individually<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
muscles individually think of them as a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
muscles individually think of them as a
