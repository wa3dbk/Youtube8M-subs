00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
know your normal AC adapter which we

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.090 
know your normal AC adapter which we
have<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.810> antenna<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.590> Wi-Fi

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
have right here in antenna for the Wi-Fi

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
have right here in antenna for the Wi-Fi
you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> small<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.570> antenna

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you know there's a small little antenna

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.210 
you know there's a small little antenna
but<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.259> give<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> close-up<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but I'm gonna give you a close-up and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.630 
but I'm gonna give you a close-up and
show<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> about

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.550 

so<00:01:38.640> taking<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> look<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.780> unit<00:01:40.080> here<00:01:40.260> it<00:01:40.440> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so taking a look at the unit here it is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260 
so taking a look at the unit here it is
pretty<00:01:40.920> small<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> reference<00:01:42.060> point

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pretty small just for a reference point

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.499 
pretty small just for a reference point
here's<00:01:42.869> an<00:01:42.990> iPhone<00:01:43.350> 4<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:44.760> know<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.360> kind

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
here's an iPhone 4 you know you can kind

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.590 
here's an iPhone 4 you know you can kind
of<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.710> difference<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:48.330> big

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of see the difference you know how big

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
of see the difference you know how big
this<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> unit<00:01:49.920> actually

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this actually is now that unit actually

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.680 
this actually is now that unit actually
does<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> lot<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.060> weight<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
does have a lot of weight to it this is

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.740
