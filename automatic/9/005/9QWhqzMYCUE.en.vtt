having<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.769> hard<00:02:22.920> time<00:02:22.980> doing<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.549> camera

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
having a hard time doing it on camera

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.879 
having a hard time doing it on camera
because<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:25.079> best<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.680> just

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
because it's really the best is to just

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:31.429 
because it's really the best is to just
keep<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.459> flat<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.849> head<00:02:29.849> where<00:02:30.439> as

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
keep it flat you have this head where as

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.559 
keep it flat you have this head where as
you<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.400> visor<00:02:35.639> is<00:02:35.939> now<00:02:36.060> painted

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
you can see the visor is now painted

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.289 
you can see the visor is now painted
this<00:02:36.750> turquoise<00:02:37.560> blue<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.189> you<00:02:38.909> have<00:02:39.060> some

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
this turquoise blue and you have some

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.649 
this turquoise blue and you have some
fire<00:02:39.870> highlights<00:02:41.540> hmm

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
fire highlights hmm

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.979 
fire highlights hmm
so<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:44.159> actually<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.819> one<00:02:45.269> leg<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.780> here

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
so it's actually this one leg right here

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.869 
so it's actually this one leg right here
where<00:02:46.139> the<00:02:46.260> controls<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:47.040> gimmick<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.639> one

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
where the controls the gimmick this one

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.750 
where the controls the gimmick this one
is<00:02:48.000> static<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.810> fixed<00:02:49.849> now<00:02:51.079> rankle<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.260> other

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
is static and fixed now rankle the other

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.300 
is static and fixed now rankle the other
power<00:02:53.760> battlers<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.689> one<00:02:54.930> steppers<00:02:55.469> this<00:02:56.099> is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
power battlers and one steppers this is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.000 
power battlers and one steppers this is
a<00:02:56.340> scorn<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.750> supposedly<00:02:58.199> suppose<00:02:58.739> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
a scorn is the supposedly suppose that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.399 
a scorn is the supposedly suppose that
haven't<00:02:59.459> simplified<00:03:00.030> transformation<00:03:00.719> which

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
haven't simplified transformation which

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.990 
haven't simplified transformation which
I'll<00:03:01.590> bring<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.859> instructions<00:03:02.370> right<00:03:02.819> now

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
I'll bring the instructions right now

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.619 
I'll bring the instructions right now
and<00:03:03.449> they<00:03:04.199> claim<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.889> in<00:03:05.250> eight<00:03:05.609> steps<00:03:05.969> now

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
and they claim to do in eight steps now

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.689 
and they claim to do in eight steps now
well<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.019> as<00:03:07.199> bad<00:03:07.349> as<00:03:07.530> drift<00:03:07.829> there<00:03:08.549> are<00:03:08.669> a

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
well I'm not as bad as drift there are a

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.360 
well I'm not as bad as drift there are a
few<00:03:09.060> things<00:03:09.359> they<00:03:09.569> kind<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.989> gloss<00:03:10.680> over<00:03:10.980> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
few things they kind of gloss over and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.539 
few things they kind of gloss over and
don't<00:03:11.699> mention<00:03:11.939> first<00:03:12.719> of<00:03:12.930> all<00:03:13.109> I<00:03:13.290> wish<00:03:14.129> they

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
don't mention first of all I wish they

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.789 
don't mention first of all I wish they
would<00:03:14.699> have<00:03:14.819> better<00:03:15.209> instructions<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.169> how<00:03:16.769> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
would have better instructions on how to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.770 
would have better instructions on how to
use<00:03:16.949> the<00:03:17.189> one<00:03:17.370> step<00:03:17.519> getting<00:03:17.969> that's<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:18.569> for

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
use the one step getting that's not for

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.709 
use the one step getting that's not for
me<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.319> for<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.680> kids<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.939> yeah<00:03:21.120> let's

me that's for the kids but yeah let's
pause<00:03:21.989> here<00:03:22.400> have<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> drink<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.909> water<00:03:24.060> or

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
pause here have a drink of water or

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.530 
pause here have a drink of water or
seltzer<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:26.090> we'll<00:03:27.090> get<00:03:27.239> into<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
seltzer and we'll get into the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.219 
seltzer and we'll get into the
transformation<00:03:29.359> okay<00:03:30.359> now<00:03:31.169> for

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
transformation okay now for

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.899 
transformation okay now for
transformation<00:03:32.009> when<00:03:32.099> you<00:03:32.159> want<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.340> just

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
transformation when you want to just

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.719 
transformation when you want to just
make<00:03:33.090> sure<00:03:33.269> his<00:03:33.959> arm<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.949> arms<00:03:35.189> of<00:03:35.310> scorn<00:03:35.579> are

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
make sure his arm the arms of scorn are

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.030 
make sure his arm the arms of scorn are
down<00:03:35.909> at<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.150> side<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.389> it's<00:03:37.199> in<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.439> neutral

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
down at the side and it's in a neutral

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.879 
down at the side and it's in a neutral
relaxed<00:03:38.489> position<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.780> first<00:03:40.019> step<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.530> to

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
relaxed position the first step is to

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:47.179 
relaxed position the first step is to
rotate<00:03:41.189> the<00:03:42.979> hand<00:03:43.979> outward<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.349> do<00:03:46.349> like<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
rotate the hand outward I do like the

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.909 
rotate the hand outward I do like the
detailed<00:03:47.579> sculpt<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.109> inside<00:03:49.530> here<00:03:49.769> that

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
detailed sculpt on the inside here that

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.259 
detailed sculpt on the inside here that
make<00:03:50.189> it<00:03:50.310> look<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.609> hands<00:03:50.819> even<00:03:50.970> though<00:03:51.120> it's

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
make it look like hands even though it's

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.229 
make it look like hands even though it's
the<00:03:51.359> dinosaur<00:03:51.780> head<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.909> you<00:03:53.909> want<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.150> go

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
the dinosaur head and you want to go

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.619 
the dinosaur head and you want to go
ahead<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.720> then<00:03:54.840> flip<00:03:55.349> forward<00:03:56.479> what<00:03:57.479> would

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
ahead and then flip forward what would

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.719 
ahead and then flip forward what would
be<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.849> claws<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.209> dinosaur<00:04:01.019> mode<00:04:01.729> come

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
be the claws and dinosaur mode come

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.629 
be the claws and dinosaur mode come
around<00:04:02.969> the<00:04:03.150> back<00:04:03.359> here<00:04:03.689> and<00:04:03.979> this<00:04:04.979> is<00:04:05.459> where

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
around the back here and this is where

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.499 
around the back here and this is where
things<00:04:05.909> get<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.180> little<00:04:06.359> tricky<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:09.180> show<00:04:09.449> you

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
things get a little tricky they show you

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.860 
things get a little tricky they show you
closing<00:04:10.049> up<00:04:10.290> these<00:04:10.680> back<00:04:11.040> panels<00:04:11.729> well<00:04:12.689> these

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
closing up these back panels well these

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.689 
closing up these back panels well these
are<00:04:13.019> on<00:04:13.139> soft<00:04:13.530> rubber<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:14.189> they<00:04:14.280> really<00:04:14.519> don't

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
are on soft rubber and they really don't

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.849 
are on soft rubber and they really don't
stay<00:04:14.939> close<00:04:15.299> another<00:04:16.079> thing<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.440> want<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.680> do

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
stay close another thing you want to do

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.860 
stay close another thing you want to do
is<00:04:17.130> go<00:04:17.579> ahead<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:17.909> straighten<00:04:18.359> out<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:18.659> tail

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
is go ahead and straighten out the tail

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.469 
is go ahead and straighten out the tail
here<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.919> will<00:04:20.009> actually<00:04:20.280> peg<00:04:20.789> in<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.359> the

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
here and it will actually peg in to the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.320 
here and it will actually peg in to the
back<00:04:21.719> that<00:04:22.109> will<00:04:22.710> help<00:04:22.979> secure<00:04:23.190> things<00:04:23.669> now

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
back that will help secure things now

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.149 
back that will help secure things now
when<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.599> recommend<00:04:25.139> due<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.620> soft<00:04:25.889> rubber

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
when I recommend due to the soft rubber

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.010 
when I recommend due to the soft rubber
ease<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.849> want<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.090> come<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.479> with<00:04:27.630> your<00:04:27.719> thumb

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.550 
hinge which is a word
tighter<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.460> little<00:04:33.700> stronger<00:04:34.470> instead<00:04:35.470> of

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
tighter and a little stronger instead of

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.500 
tighter and a little stronger instead of
pulling<00:04:35.890> from<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.400> rubber<00:04:36.640> because<00:04:37.120> that

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
pulling from the rubber because that

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.630 
pulling from the rubber because that
just<00:04:37.750> might<00:04:38.020> actually<00:04:38.410> end<00:04:38.770> up<00:04:39.040> causing<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.550> to

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
just might actually end up causing it to

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.210 
just might actually end up causing it to
tear<00:04:39.960> now<00:04:40.960> there's<00:04:41.170> no<00:04:41.320> real<00:04:41.590> way<00:04:41.890> for<00:04:41.920> this<00:04:42.160> to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
tear now there's no real way for this to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.460 
tear now there's no real way for this to
take<00:04:42.520> together<00:04:42.730> obviously<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.930> looks<00:04:44.110> like

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
take together obviously it looks like

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.200 
take together obviously it looks like
one<00:04:45.420> side<00:04:46.420> is<00:04:46.750> supposed<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.320> hook<00:04:48.130> into<00:04:48.400> the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
one side is supposed to hook into the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.650 
one side is supposed to hook into the
other<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:49.720> that<00:04:50.460> just<00:04:51.460> really<00:04:51.660> doesn't

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
other and that just really doesn't

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.570 
other and that just really doesn't
happen<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:53.200> my<00:04:53.410> figure<00:04:53.770> it's<00:04:54.280> not<00:04:54.460> like

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
happen on my figure it's not like

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.820 
happen on my figure it's not like
anything's<00:04:55.000> warped<00:04:55.390> or<00:04:55.540> anything<00:04:55.720> it's<00:04:56.470> just

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
anything's warped or anything it's just

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.020 
anything's warped or anything it's just
the<00:04:57.400> soft<00:04:57.670> plastic<00:04:58.300> doesn't<00:04:59.020> work

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
the soft plastic doesn't work

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.310 
the soft plastic doesn't work
so<00:05:01.290> that's<00:05:02.290> your<00:05:02.470> step<00:05:02.740> three<00:05:03.450> step<00:05:04.450> four<00:05:04.630> you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
so that's your step three step four you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.540 
so that's your step three step four you
come<00:05:05.590> back<00:05:05.830> around<00:05:06.040> is<00:05:06.960> flip<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.500> arms<00:05:09.220> up<00:05:09.400> at

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
come back around is flip the arms up at

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.930 
come back around is flip the arms up at
the<00:05:09.640> shoulder<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.920> this<00:05:11.920> will<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:12.310> form

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
the shoulder and this will then form

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.390 
the shoulder and this will then form
your<00:05:13.350> dinosaur<00:05:15.630> head<00:05:16.630> neck<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.530> torso<00:05:17.920> and

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
your dinosaur head neck and torso and

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.660 
your dinosaur head neck and torso and
things<00:05:18.850> will<00:05:19.030> snap<00:05:19.480> together<00:05:19.720> like<00:05:20.140> such

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
things will snap together like such

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.120 
things will snap together like such
making<00:05:21.670> look<00:05:21.850> you<00:05:22.000> got<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.150> flying<00:05:22.600> Dino

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
making look you got a flying Dino

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.660 
making look you got a flying Dino
and<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:26.770> know<00:05:26.890> so<00:05:27.010> that's<00:05:27.160> actually<00:05:27.310> step

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
and you know so that's actually step

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.880 
and you know so that's actually step
four<00:05:28.000> it's<00:05:28.360> flipping<00:05:28.720> things<00:05:28.960> up<00:05:29.170> Step<00:05:29.620> five

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
four it's flipping things up Step five

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.030 
four it's flipping things up Step five
is<00:05:29.920> picking<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.550> all<00:05:30.730> together<00:05:31.260> step<00:05:32.260> six<00:05:32.590> is

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
is picking it all together step six is

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.770 
is picking it all together step six is
bending<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.690> figure<00:05:35.050> at<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.680> hips

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
bending the the figure at the hips

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.270 
bending the the figure at the hips
getting<00:05:37.780> ready<00:05:37.930> for<00:05:38.070> finishing<00:05:39.070> out<00:05:39.250> the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
getting ready for finishing out the

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.260 
getting ready for finishing out the
dinosaur<00:05:39.850> mode<00:05:40.060> step<00:05:40.870> seven<00:05:41.290> is<00:05:41.910> rotating<00:05:42.910> the

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
dinosaur mode step seven is rotating the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.110 
dinosaur mode step seven is rotating the
legs<00:05:43.510> around<00:05:43.840> now<00:05:44.530> again<00:05:44.800> they<00:05:45.280> only<00:05:45.310> show<00:05:45.760> one

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
legs around now again they only show one

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.390 
legs around now again they only show one
light<00:05:46.440> technically<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.470> consider<00:05:48.010> this<00:05:48.160> two

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
light technically I consider this two

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.600 
light technically I consider this two
step<00:05:48.670> since<00:05:49.020> unless<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:50.230> have<00:05:50.470> some<00:05:50.890> magical

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
step since unless you have some magical

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.170 
step since unless you have some magical
dexterity<00:05:52.480> I<00:05:52.660> can<00:05:53.230> only<00:05:53.350> really<00:05:53.650> rotate<00:05:54.310> one

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
dexterity I can only really rotate one

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.070 
dexterity I can only really rotate one
leg<00:05:55.390> at<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.600> time

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
leg at a time

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.120 
leg at a time
and<00:05:56.430> there<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:57.580> have<00:05:57.610> scorn<00:05:58.210> in<00:05:58.630> his<00:05:59.260> dinosaur

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
and there you have scorn in his dinosaur

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.360 
and there you have scorn in his dinosaur
mode<00:06:00.430> so<00:06:01.360> yeah<00:06:01.960> it's<00:06:02.140> roughly<00:06:02.440> eight<00:06:02.680> steps<00:06:03.040> I

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
mode so yeah it's roughly eight steps I

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.130 
mode so yeah it's roughly eight steps I
would<00:06:03.640> say<00:06:03.820> it's<00:06:03.910> more<00:06:03.940> like<00:06:04.210> nine<00:06:04.420> or<00:06:04.600> ten<00:06:04.810> but

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
would say it's more like nine or ten but

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.550 
would say it's more like nine or ten but
whatever<00:06:06.180> dinosaur<00:06:07.180> mode<00:06:07.450> is<00:06:07.660> very<00:06:07.960> nice<00:06:08.170> you

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
whatever dinosaur mode is very nice you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.890 
whatever dinosaur mode is very nice you
do<00:06:08.740> have<00:06:09.460> some<00:06:09.730> articulation<00:06:10.090> here<00:06:10.720> at<00:06:10.780> the

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
do have some articulation here at the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.980 
do have some articulation here at the
neck<00:06:11.140> do<00:06:11.470> those<00:06:11.800> elbow<00:06:12.670> joints<00:06:13.060> so<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.660> can't

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
neck do those elbow joints so you can't

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.460 
neck do those elbow joints so you can't
have<00:06:14.140> the<00:06:14.320> head<00:06:14.680> facing<00:06:15.190> up<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:16.720> tail<00:06:16.930> still

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
have the head facing up the tail still

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.180 
have the head facing up the tail still
has<00:06:17.800> some<00:06:18.280> poseability<00:06:19.180> here<00:06:19.780> at<00:06:19.990> this<00:06:20.860> joint

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
has some poseability here at this joint

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.400 
has some poseability here at this joint
but<00:06:22.090> other<00:06:22.210> than<00:06:22.390> that<00:06:22.480> everything<00:06:23.170> is<00:06:23.260> pretty

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
but other than that everything is pretty

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.740 
but other than that everything is pretty
much<00:06:23.650> fixed<00:06:24.100> and<00:06:24.220> Static<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:27.190> legs<00:06:27.940> are<00:06:28.240> in<00:06:28.450> a

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
much fixed and Static the legs are in a

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.260 
much fixed and Static the legs are in a
somewhat<00:06:29.140> bent<00:06:29.530> pose<00:06:30.010> due<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.670> the<00:06:30.880> way<00:06:31.060> they

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
somewhat bent pose due to the way they

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.870 
somewhat bent pose due to the way they
rotate<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:32.080> because<00:06:33.010> of<00:06:33.160> the<00:06:33.250> hip<00:06:33.490> gimmick

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
rotate and because of the hip gimmick

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.790 
rotate and because of the hip gimmick
one's<00:06:34.120> going<00:06:34.390> to<00:06:34.450> be<00:06:34.600> facing<00:06:34.960> out<00:06:35.200> ever<00:06:35.500> so

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
one's going to be facing out ever so

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.310 
one's going to be facing out ever so
slightly<00:06:36.130> but<00:06:36.310> surely<00:06:37.240> not<00:06:37.420> that<00:06:37.630> bad<00:06:37.840> it's<00:06:38.260> a

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
slightly but surely not that bad it's a

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.780 
slightly but surely not that bad it's a
cool<00:06:38.530> looking<00:06:38.830> figure<00:06:39.220> I

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
cool looking figure I

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.300 
cool looking figure I
actually<00:06:41.180> say<00:06:41.390> this<00:06:41.540> is<00:06:41.950> almost<00:06:42.950> as<00:06:43.250> good

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
actually say this is almost as good

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.180 
actually say this is almost as good
working<00:06:43.760> as<00:06:43.910> the<00:06:44.090> construct<00:06:44.660> BOTS<00:06:45.190> version

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
working as the construct BOTS version

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.550 
working as the construct BOTS version
but<00:06:46.460> maybe<00:06:46.730> not<00:06:46.970> as<00:06:47.150> good-looking<00:06:47.360> as<00:06:47.750> the<00:06:48.050> lux

but maybe not as good-looking as the lux
I<00:06:48.590> wish<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:49.550> head<00:06:49.730> can<00:06:49.940> move<00:06:49.970> a<00:06:50.150> little<00:06:50.330> but<00:06:50.660> I

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
I wish the head can move a little but I

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
draw there because the fact that it's

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.710

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 
final thoughts in scorn definitely worth

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.520 
final thoughts in scorn definitely worth
picking<00:07:02.930> up<00:07:03.670> it<00:07:04.670> is<00:07:04.790> a<00:07:04.820> fun<00:07:05.210> figure<00:07:05.930> I<00:07:06.110> don't

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530

going to get in this power battlers line

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.100 
going to get in this power battlers line
I<00:07:12.920> would<00:07:13.550> hope<00:07:13.790> we<00:07:13.940> would<00:07:13.970> see<00:07:14.270> Grimlock<00:07:14.780> since

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
I would hope we would see Grimlock since

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.670 
I would hope we would see Grimlock since
we<00:07:15.200> are<00:07:15.350> seeing<00:07:16.270> Optimus<00:07:17.270> Prime<00:07:17.540> it's<00:07:17.780> some

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
we are seeing Optimus Prime it's some

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.520 
we are seeing Optimus Prime it's some
point<00:07:20.020> with<00:07:21.020> a<00:07:21.050> sword<00:07:21.470> slashing<00:07:21.980> gimmick<00:07:22.480> but

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
point with a sword slashing gimmick but

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.100 
point with a sword slashing gimmick but
other<00:07:24.530> than<00:07:24.680> that<00:07:24.770> who<00:07:25.280> knows<00:07:25.630> I<00:07:26.630> think<00:07:26.990> this

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
other than that who knows I think this

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.320 
other than that who knows I think this
is<00:07:27.260> great<00:07:27.500> for<00:07:28.070> slightly<00:07:28.490> older<00:07:28.850> kids<00:07:29.090> and

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
is great for slightly older kids and

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.630 
is great for slightly older kids and
like<00:07:30.110> I<00:07:30.230> said<00:07:30.290> these<00:07:30.530> are<00:07:30.590> I<00:07:30.740> think<00:07:31.100> the<00:07:31.310> best

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:31.640 
like I said these are I think the best

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.570 
like I said these are I think the best
of<00:07:31.910> the<00:07:32.000> simplified<00:07:33.400> Transformers<00:07:34.400> the

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
of the simplified Transformers the

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.970 
of the simplified Transformers the
gimmick<00:07:35.240> is<00:07:35.390> fun<00:07:35.660> and<00:07:36.410> I<00:07:36.470> think<00:07:36.650> the<00:07:36.710> kids<00:07:36.860> will

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:36.980 
gimmick is fun and I think the kids will

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.720 
gimmick is fun and I think the kids will
get<00:07:37.070> a<00:07:37.130> good<00:07:39.130> kick<00:07:40.130> out<00:07:40.340> of<00:07:40.370> the<00:07:40.550> whole

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:40.730 
get a good kick out of the whole

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.840 
get a good kick out of the whole
squeezing<00:07:41.360> and<00:07:41.510> tail<00:07:42.320> whipping<00:07:42.650> and<00:07:42.920> just<00:07:43.730> be

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.850 
squeezing and tail whipping and just be

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.520 
squeezing and tail whipping and just be
careful<00:07:44.030> with<00:07:44.360> your<00:07:44.510> hands<00:07:44.660> because<00:07:44.960> these

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.530 
careful with your hands because these

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.400 
careful with your hands because these
spikes<00:07:45.920> they're<00:07:46.250> soft<00:07:46.580> plastic<00:07:47.210> but<00:07:47.450> I<00:07:47.690> kind

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.410 
spikes they're soft plastic but I kind

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.440
