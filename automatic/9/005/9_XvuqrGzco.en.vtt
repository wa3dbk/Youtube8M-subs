episode of some one day today we are
going<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.599> do<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.019> our<00:00:13.139> review<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:14.219> time

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
going to do in our review but this time

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.700 
going to do in our review but this time
it's<00:00:14.730> not<00:00:14.849> scary<00:00:15.150> real<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.289> are<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
it's not scary real but we are going to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.790 
it's not scary real but we are going to
do<00:00:16.859> about<00:00:18.140> bearings<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.900> very<00:00:22.260> let<00:00:22.680> me

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
do about bearings so what is very let me

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.250 
do about bearings so what is very let me
show<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.250> picture<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.570> bearing<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
show you a picture what a bearing is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.310 
show you a picture what a bearing is
made<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:26.779> Ernest<00:00:27.830> as<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.570> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
made of Ernest as you can see this is a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.299 
made of Ernest as you can see this is a
bearing<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.450> Perry<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> middle<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
bearing a Perry is in the middle of this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
bearing a Perry is in the middle of this
game<00:00:35.610> without<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> bearings<00:00:36.600> your<00:00:36.840> bill

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
game without the bearings your bill

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.060 
game without the bearings your bill
cannot<00:00:37.500> move

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
cannot move

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.950 
cannot move
imagine<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> screw<00:00:39.920> inside<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.850> view<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
imagine the screw inside this view of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.130 
imagine the screw inside this view of
nothing<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.219> plastic<00:00:44.489> rim<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.629> wheel

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
nothing but the plastic rim of the wheel

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.040 
nothing but the plastic rim of the wheel
how<00:00:46.739> many<00:00:46.980> friction<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> cost<00:00:48.360> with

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
how many friction is it in the cost with

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
how many friction is it in the cost with
other<00:00:49.289> friction<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> mount<00:00:51.090> heat<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
other friction going on mount heat and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
other friction going on mount heat and
saw<00:00:52.230> energy<00:00:52.680> generator<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.399> thought<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
saw energy generator I thought that we

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.250 
saw energy generator I thought that we
can<00:00:54.809> speak<00:00:55.199> properly<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.930> reduce

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
can speak properly at all so to reduce

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.849 
can speak properly at all so to reduce
friction

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
friction

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.529

people<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.339> come<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.149> very

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
people have actually come up with very

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.859 
people have actually come up with very
great<00:01:03.719> idea<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.860> put<00:01:05.100> bearings<00:01:05.820> inside<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
great idea and put bearings inside the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.580 
great idea and put bearings inside the
skin<00:01:07.140> okay<00:01:07.740> fairies<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:09.240> use<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:10.080> ball

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
skin okay fairies that we use it's ball

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.960 
skin okay fairies that we use it's ball
bearings<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.880> ball<00:01:12.119> bearings<00:01:12.149> are<00:01:12.750> usually

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
bearings these ball bearings are usually

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.260 
bearings these ball bearings are usually
made<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.570> machines<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.909> other<00:01:17.909> mechanical

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
made from machines and other mechanical

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.289 
made from machines and other mechanical
purposes<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.580> rest<00:01:20.580> Polly<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> guy<00:01:21.240> who

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
purposes but rest Polly the guy who

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
purposes but rest Polly the guy who
invented<00:01:21.539> the<00:01:22.020> inline<00:01:22.320> skates<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.979> use

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
invented the inline skates actually use

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.730 
invented the inline skates actually use
this<00:01:23.580> idea<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.539> put<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:26.009> ice<00:01:26.100> skating

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
this idea and put it into an ice skating

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.399 
this idea and put it into an ice skating
a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> problems<00:01:29.880> occur<00:01:30.539> when<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.960> comes<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
a lot of problems occur when it comes to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.669 
a lot of problems occur when it comes to
very<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:32.060> last<00:01:33.060> time<00:01:33.330> people<00:01:34.170> used<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
very because last time people used to

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.529 
very because last time people used to
make<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.190> kinds<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.670> bearings<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:36.330> this

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
make all kinds of bearings so this

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.109 
make all kinds of bearings so this

okay look we are going to achieve set
the<00:01:42.690> standard<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.200> bearing<00:01:43.619> when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> new

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the standard for bearing when you new

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730 
the standard for bearing when you new
make<00:01:44.490> merry<00:01:44.729> new<00:01:45.090> follow<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.840> specific

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
make merry new follow this specific

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
make merry new follow this specific
standards<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.819> with<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.179> power<00:01:48.330> rating

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
standards so with the power rating

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.169 
standards so with the power rating
called<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.440> back<00:01:49.709> rating<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:51.000> more

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
called a back rating for more
