00:00:05.548 --> 00:00:06.715
Eyes on the objective.

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.675
Engage at your discretion.

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:09.801
Roger that.

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:12.512
Target

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:14.094
lasered.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.141
3, 2, 1.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.074
Rifle.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.355
Good kill.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.571
The war is now
a first person shooter.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.197
Half of you are recruited in malls

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.533
precisely because
you are a bunch of gamers.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.659
Any time of day or night
drones are in the sky

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.084
above whatever godforsaken place
we are at war with that day.

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:46.296
You're cleared hot.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.714
Light 'em up.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.634
- Warheads on foreheads.
- Missile's off the rail.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.137
They don't call it a "Hellfire"
for nothing.

00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:59.559
So, what did you log?
3,000 hours in F16s,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:02.521
6 tours, two hundred combat service
before you got here?

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.526
So I heard you want to go back to
combat? Are you out of your mind?

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:08.563
Hi, dad!

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.113
Is it so bad what you're doing now?

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.365
You're still
making people safer, right?

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.451
- Rifle when ready.
- Missile's away.

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:19.121
- God damn it! What's that?
- Abort?

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:21.039
Negative. Primary objective.

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:28.338
Don't ask me if it's a just war.

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.841
That's not up to us.
To us it's just war.

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:34.356
I am a pilot and I'm not fine.

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:37.139
I don't know what it is
that I am doing, but it's not fine.

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:40.267
Word's come down the chain
we're stepping up attacks

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.579
because we got intel
says they're stepping up attacks.

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:44.938
You ever get
to fly in a war or something?

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:48.567
Blew away six Taliban in Pakistan
just earlier today.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.983
And now I'm going home to barbecue.

00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:53.321
Everyday I feel like a coward

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:55.723
to get pot shots at somebody
halfway around the world.

00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:59.453
He's quiet.
What happens when he gets angry?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.787
It's more quiet.

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:04.100
You just got
to keep compartmentalizing.

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:07.044
And never mind
the compartments got too close.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:10.756
What is it that you miss so bad?
Combat?

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:21.558
I'm OK!

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:30.175
