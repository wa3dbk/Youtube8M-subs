I<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.790> hope<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.000> they<00:02:23.270> use<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> different

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
I just hope that they use a different

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.070 
I just hope that they use a different
video<00:02:24.319> than<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.740> one<00:02:24.890> they<00:02:25.010> made<00:02:25.190> for<00:02:25.430> e3<00:02:26.080> 2006

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
video than the one they made for e3 2006

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.580 
video than the one they made for e3 2006
I<00:02:27.380> also<00:02:27.860> hope<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.310> two<00:02:28.880> years<00:02:29.240> from<00:02:29.300> now<00:02:29.840> or

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
I also hope that two years from now or

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.260 
I also hope that two years from now or
when<00:02:30.770> they're<00:02:30.920> kickstart<00:02:31.400> launches<00:02:31.849> they

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
when they're kickstart launches they

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.050 
when they're kickstart launches they
don't<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.950> completely<00:02:33.950> decide<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:36.819> grow<00:02:37.819> up

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
don't just completely decide to grow up
