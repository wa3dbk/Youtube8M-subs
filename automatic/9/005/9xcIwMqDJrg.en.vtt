 and we have everything with you today I 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.450
 I am bringing to you a recent 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.240
 news from Japan recently 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.789
 created the same cybernetic school for 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 High school in Japan I think that like 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 large part of the world it is already 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.490
 interacting within this virtual environment 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.420
 as universities some courses that have 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.429
 around 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 is I think Japan is not 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.880
 different right 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.910
 he is entering into this world 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.910
 to bring knowledge but for more 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 close to the students since most of the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.000
 people are already inserted within the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.210
 So why not get these 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.520
 students in the internet also nfa 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.890
 cool that is geared towards high school 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.379
 So people do not have to go. 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.440
 attend classroom online 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.359
 what is the school of education 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.489
 secondary 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.680
 I started with objective created the first 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.080
 virtual school in japan 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.630
 teachers and students interact through 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.299
 of avatars on the internet 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 the avatars they can be fined with 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.450
 the characteristics of the students and they 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 can interact through tea 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 environment that is not know if you 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.659
 They know but have a game that comes babo 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 send house line 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.290
 it resembles a little button and the all 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.960
 the Sims 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.760
 So I think it 's pretty easy to do. 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.570
 understanding the model itself 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.080
 in a gay model that is a game 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.230
 really idea of ​​how people work 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.290
 some range of 20 to 30 minutes a class 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.240
 do activities there that is right after 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.400
 video in right activity 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.630
 and then if I can not do all the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 activities 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.940
 it is evident that they have there they win 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.790
 points with the tips you can be 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.150
 changing a lot of my hair to 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.190
 clothes is to build a better house because 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.320
 there you will stay at home because the world 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.990
 virtual you will have your little house very 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.210
 here at your school, right? 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.440
 only that the school really existed in 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.120
 It's up there, I think it's really cool, but 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.740
 Then you must be wondering more 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.930
 then how does this question is the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.620
 results of the activities and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.320
 to believe 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.260
 distance learning is that it is a 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.209
 eder distance learning and he 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.370
 works more or less this way 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.489
 four times a year and has been going to 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.100
 school for employing report gives to 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.950
 see how it is doing right 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.130
 he after three years he receives the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.030
 coconut diploma which is high school 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.790
 Japanese 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.670
 making a brief observation there the people 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.400
 you may notice that 90% of the students they 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.090
 give up is attending schools 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.550
 common are the presential ones because of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.540
 is a syndrome that calls ricci as 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.330
 it is the syndrome that leads to isolation 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.610
 a lot of people it's a book we do not 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.300
 can generalize only the Japanese 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.790
 but that's how many people are suffering from 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.870
 isolation sometimes the shy person 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.260
 sometimes the person 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.560
 in the others so I think this model 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.360
 teaching and it fits you very well for this 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.040
 kind of person right? 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.769
 other people who want more 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.870
 practicality but it is the only practicality 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.140
 because in Japan it is a little different 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.930
 of Brazilian education is not, for example, the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.650
 student who goes to school until 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.079
 schoolboy for example is the basics right? 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.900
 actually on the basic Sunday I think 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.220
 It is more to the point but not 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.290
 core where the old do not know how 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.750
 talk but finally the coconut like the people 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.329
 They frequent a coconut so I do not know 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.560
 least the people I met I can 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.870
 be mistaken, no 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.790
 usually the body he is not a crime 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.510
 in brazil that people this me 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.530
 thank you to make the body the best to 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.959
 do the college 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.320
 the Japanese he did not know how to choose 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.270
 they want to make a knot even because it's you 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.729
 have to undergo some tests in the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.450
 time passing ready to go back 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.760
 in the subject is this teaching I think he 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.610
 fits very well for this type of person 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.130
 who was speaking at once of 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.039
 isolation are more timid people 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:45.880
 closed and as in Japan most of the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:49.840
 people when he was in during the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.229
 teaching in school the time of school he 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.110
 just study understand you do not have this 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:59.710
 That you're not even in Brazil, for example. 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.419
 and you study and work because your 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.099
 this family going through some 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.199
 university or yourself 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.099
 Wish you were working earlier 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.490
 Japan is finally only study then so is 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.810
 a lot is maybe it's the syndrome 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.830
 same owner 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.660
 How bullying is he? 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.789
 A lot of bullying is also a problem. 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.980
 because people end up if they do not even 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.560
 isolating even then you are teaching 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.960
 came he was coming to meet this 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.720
 demand that is coming out right 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.610
 during all its observations 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.060
 they have however decided to do 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.060
 so and some teachers say 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.850
 although being in the virtual world is 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.360
 There is the living environment because right 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.920
 people can interact then existed 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.400
 a social relationship 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.740
 but now guess what it costs to 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.230
 did you study at this school a year ago? 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:04.760
 study at school month if you know who it costs 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.590
 approximately 180 thousand yen about 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.850
 four thousand five hundred and thirty eight 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.240
 real 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.060
 although I did not calculate it is more the 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.160
 first dollar on this you're a 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.470
 button stressed just want to say us 11 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.840
 years here the high dollar so why 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.900
 a little more expensive and the classes they 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.330
 are taken daily they can be 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.910
 with your tablet computer or 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.040
 It's smartphone I think I feel 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.800
 I think he's here to stay and he's going 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.650
 bring a major evolution right 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.890
 in this world and the only one but this is people 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.080
 So people are the video stays around here. 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.910

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.770
