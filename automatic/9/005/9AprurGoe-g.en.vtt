00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
okay um takes up 16,000 kilobytes um

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.630 
okay um takes up 16,000 kilobytes um
it'll<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.930> 18,000<00:01:01.710> sometimes<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.340> even

lot<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.110> lot<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.409> night<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:08.010> computer

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
lot that's a lot at night my computer

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
lot that's a lot at night my computer
could<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> using<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.510> increase

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
could be using that to increase

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
could be using that to increase
performance<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.830> games<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.430> any<00:01:11.549> other

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
performance and games and any other

that's<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.390> huge<00:02:14.959> difference<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:18.160> killable

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
that's a huge difference of of killable

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.430 
that's a huge difference of of killable
memory<00:02:19.790> being<00:02:20.120> used<00:02:20.450> that's<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.110> huge

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
memory being used that's a huge

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.759 
memory being used that's a huge
difference<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:23.620> um<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:25.400> usually<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.630> do<00:02:27.380> this<00:02:27.590> I

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
difference so um I usually I do this I

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.690 
difference so um I usually I do this I
keep<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:29.410> prettiness<00:02:30.410> if<00:02:30.860> if

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
keep it like this the prettiness if if

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.100 
keep it like this the prettiness if if
you<00:02:31.819> will<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.239> i<00:02:33.049> don't<00:02:33.410> care<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.950> my<00:02:34.870> windows<00:02:35.870> i

you<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.130> seem<00:02:49.549> performance<00:02:50.480> increase<00:02:51.910> see

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
you can seem performance increase see

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.390 
you can seem performance increase see
