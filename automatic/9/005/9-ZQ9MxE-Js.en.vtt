00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
but i fear for this I knew if it was a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.779 
but i fear for this I knew if it was a
pocket<00:00:25.529> passer<00:00:25.830> he<00:00:26.099> wouldn't<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.460> much

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
pocket passer he wouldn't go for much

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460 
pocket passer he wouldn't go for much
and<00:00:26.970> guess<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.269> he's<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.349> much

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and guess what he's not going for much

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.259 
and guess what he's not going for much
me<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.859> his<00:00:28.949> stats<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> start<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.670> nice<00:00:29.820> he

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
me but his stats to start so nice he

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.759 
me but his stats to start so nice he
looks<00:00:30.330> deadly<00:00:30.720> accurate<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> might<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.590> play<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
looks deadly accurate I might not play a
season<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> probably<00:00:32.969> play<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
season with them but I probably play a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940
