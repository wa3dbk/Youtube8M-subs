bad and many other training institutions
are<00:01:05.440> teaching<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:05.890> way<00:01:06.070> but<00:01:06.850> we<00:01:06.970> teach<00:01:07.210> our

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
are teaching this way but we teach our

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.130 
are teaching this way but we teach our
who<00:01:07.659> what<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.350> where<00:01:08.920> maybe<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.810> kind<00:01:11.049> of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
who what and where maybe we kind of

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.990 
who what and where maybe we kind of
veered<00:01:11.380> away<00:01:11.530> definitely<00:01:11.979> from<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.580> lunar

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
veered away definitely from that lunar

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.180 
veered away definitely from that lunar
we<00:01:13.299> found<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.930> lunar<00:01:14.260> acronym<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.040> some

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
we found that the lunar acronym and some

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.810 
we found that the lunar acronym and some
others<00:01:15.549> were<00:01:15.970> just<00:01:16.180> too<00:01:16.390> mentally<00:01:16.750> exhausting

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
others were just too mentally exhausting

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
from that portray to our midbrain and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.630 
from that portray to our midbrain and
that<00:01:25.869> rational<00:01:26.350> mind<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.770> gone<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.370> our

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
that rational mind is gone and our

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
are you acting so of running low on air

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.040 
are you acting so of running low on air
and<00:02:05.830> I'm<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> first<00:02:06.580> floor<00:02:06.820> or<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.690> know<00:02:07.840> I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
and I'm on the first floor or you know I

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.600 
and I'm on the first floor or you know I
know<00:02:08.409> where<00:02:08.530> you're<00:02:08.649> at<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:08.979> then<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.459> say

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
know where you're at all then you say

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.759 
know where you're at all then you say
that<00:02:09.789> no<00:02:10.209> idea<00:02:10.479> where<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.750> am<00:02:10.840> disorientated

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
that no idea where I am disorientated

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.979 
that no idea where I am disorientated
and<00:02:12.099> I'm<00:02:12.250> running<00:02:12.580> low<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.700> air<00:02:12.909> so<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
and I'm running low on air so the

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.649 
and I'm running low on air so the
resources<00:02:14.500> needed<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.280> exactly<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.269> opposite

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
resources needed is exactly the opposite

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.640 
resources needed is exactly the opposite
of<00:02:16.720> what<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> problem<00:02:17.319> is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
of what the problem is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.589 
of what the problem is
so<00:02:18.159> for<00:02:18.519> morning<00:02:18.760> low<00:02:18.849> in<00:02:19.000> there<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.390> we<00:02:19.450> know

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
so for morning low in there that we know

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.780 
so for morning low in there that we know
airs<00:02:20.200> my<00:02:20.470> air<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.920> my<00:02:20.980> resources<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.610> need

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
airs my air and my resources that I need

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.360 
airs my air and my resources that I need
if<00:02:22.750> I'm<00:02:22.870> entangled<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> second<00:02:24.099> floor<00:02:24.310> or

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
if I'm entangled on the second floor or
