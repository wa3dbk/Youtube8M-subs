00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the easiest the easiest suggestion is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.650 
the easiest the easiest suggestion is
that<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:19.069> we<00:02:20.069> play<00:02:20.310> funk<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.150> bottom<00:02:21.480> and

jazz<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.319> top<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.700> more<00:02:23.910> detailed

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
jazz on the top but the more detailed

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.920 
jazz on the top but the more detailed
explanation<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:27.120> music<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.480> play<00:02:27.510> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
explanation is that the music I play is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.259 
explanation is that the music I play is
basically<00:02:28.380> soul<00:02:28.890> music<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.549> know<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.849> R&amp;B

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
basically soul music you know it's R&amp;B

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.410 
basically soul music you know it's R&amp;B
it's<00:02:30.959> funk<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.579> it's<00:02:32.579> got<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> lot<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.180> pop

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's funk and it's got a lot of pop

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
it's funk and it's got a lot of pop
elements<00:02:33.900> but<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> difference<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.099> that<00:02:35.250> we

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
elements but the difference is that we

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.059 
elements but the difference is that we
play<00:02:35.579> it<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> jazz<00:02:36.209> spirit<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:37.920> you're

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
play it with a jazz spirit so if you're

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
play it with a jazz spirit so if you're
a<00:02:38.099> funk<00:02:38.370> band<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.420> play<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.720> music<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> same

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
a funk band you play the music the same

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.229 
a funk band you play the music the same
way<00:02:40.440> every<00:02:40.680> night<00:02:40.860> sometimes<00:02:41.549> more<00:02:41.910> energy

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
way every night sometimes more energy

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.150 
way every night sometimes more energy
sometimes<00:02:42.599> less<00:02:42.810> energy<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.920> notes

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
sometimes less energy but the notes

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.030 
sometimes less energy but the notes

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
never change and for me the notes always

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.640 
never change and for me the notes always
change<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:48.390> about<00:02:48.630> jazz<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> always<00:02:49.380> loved
