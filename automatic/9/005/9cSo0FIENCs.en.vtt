know
that<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.710> really<00:02:10.710> translate<00:02:11.220> into<00:02:11.400> but

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that like really translate into but

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.370 
that like really translate into but
basically<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:13.440> should<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:13.980> oh<00:02:15.320> if<00:02:16.320> she

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
basically it should like oh if she

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.530 
basically it should like oh if she
should<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.980> enough<00:02:17.190> room<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.360> see

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
should have enough room so like you see

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
should have enough room so like you see
enough<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> base<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.800> should<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.070> like

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
enough of the base but it should be like

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.400 
enough of the base but it should be like
big<00:02:21.210> enough<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.720> could<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:21.990> see<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.320> from

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
big enough so you could like see it from

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.690 
big enough so you could like see it from
far<00:02:22.470> away<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.070> know<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
color and then finally you're going to

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.660 
color and then finally you're going to
need<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.580> smaller<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.600> skinny<00:02:28.470> ribbon<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.640> a

assuming that it would work just the
same<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:20.130> hair<00:03:20.520> ties<00:03:20.730> an<00:03:21.000> alligator

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
same and then hair ties an alligator

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.090 
same and then hair ties an alligator
clip<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:21.870> some<00:03:21.990> sort<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.200> clip<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.680> put<00:03:22.830> my<00:03:22.950> hair

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
have to some fabric fabric fabric fusion

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.659 
have to some fabric fabric fabric fusion
I<00:05:16.560> don't<00:05:16.770> know<00:05:16.860> it's<00:05:17.070> just<00:05:17.160> like<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.370> fabric

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
I don't know it's just like a fabric

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.190 
I don't know it's just like a fabric
glue<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.150> you<00:05:18.270> could<00:05:18.450> like<00:05:18.600> use<00:05:18.810> on<00:05:19.080> the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
glue that you could like use on the

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.800 
glue that you could like use on the
ribbons<00:05:19.470> I<00:05:19.620> guess<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.890> could<00:05:19.919> use<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:21.120> could

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
ribbons I guess you could use you could

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.260 
ribbons I guess you could use you could
use<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.140> hot<00:05:22.350> glue<00:05:22.410> gun<00:05:22.650> but<00:05:23.490> my<00:05:23.820> only<00:05:23.940> concern

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
use a hot glue gun but my only concern

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.630 
use a hot glue gun but my only concern
with<00:05:24.390> that<00:05:24.450> would<00:05:24.750> be<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.500> when<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.370> try<00:05:26.610> to

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
with that would be that when you try to

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.090 
with that would be that when you try to
fold<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.390> scrunch<00:05:27.930> your<00:05:28.020> ribbon<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.710> might<00:05:28.890> be

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
fold it scrunch your ribbon it might be

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.310 
fold it scrunch your ribbon it might be
like<00:05:29.460> too<00:05:29.700> stiff<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.419> will<00:05:30.690> come<00:05:30.990> out<00:05:31.140> word

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
like too stiff and it will come out word

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.820 
like too stiff and it will come out word
so<00:05:32.280> basically<00:05:33.150> on<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.450> and<00:05:33.690> then<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:34.620> grab

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
so basically on this and then you grab

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.240 
so basically on this and then you grab
your<00:05:35.010> second<00:05:35.520> base<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:36.210> guess<00:05:37.140> I<00:05:37.470> wasn't<00:05:38.070> sure

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
your second base I guess I wasn't sure

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.040 
your second base I guess I wasn't sure
what<00:05:38.340> I<00:05:38.430> was<00:05:38.520> going<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.760> use<00:05:38.820> but<00:05:41.330> um<00:05:42.330> I'll<00:05:42.990> just

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
what I was going to use but um I'll just

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.880 
what I was going to use but um I'll just
use<00:05:43.410> this<00:05:43.440> one<00:05:43.620> again<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.990> you're<00:05:46.740> going<00:05:46.830> to

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
use this one again and you're going to

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.170 
use this one again and you're going to
grab<00:05:47.070> your<00:05:47.220> base<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.669> you're<00:05:47.820> going<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:47.970> make

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
grab your base and you're going to make

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.880 
grab your base and you're going to make
it<00:05:48.330> probably<00:05:48.900> left<00:05:49.080> as<00:05:49.260> long<00:05:49.590> as<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:51.890> base

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
it probably left as long as the base

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.590 
it probably left as long as the base
that<00:05:53.160> you<00:05:53.220> have<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:54.060> about<00:05:54.210> two<00:05:54.390> and<00:05:54.510> a<00:05:54.570> half

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
that you have so about two and a half

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.760 
that you have so about two and a half
feet<00:05:56.150> and<00:05:57.150> then<00:05:57.270> you're<00:05:57.450> gonna<00:05:58.490> head<00:06:00.710> so<00:06:01.710> you

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
feet and then you're gonna head so you

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.740 
feet and then you're gonna head so you
have<00:06:01.919> you<00:06:02.220> have<00:06:02.460> your<00:06:02.669> base<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.210> you<00:06:03.300> have<00:06:03.510> the

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
have you have your base and you have the

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.020 
have you have your base and you have the
one<00:06:03.870> on<00:06:03.960> top<00:06:04.400> so<00:06:05.400> basically<00:06:05.729> you're<00:06:06.000> just

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
one on top so basically you're just

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.190 
one on top so basically you're just
going<00:06:06.539> to<00:06:06.720> lay<00:06:07.200> it<00:06:07.530> on<00:06:07.800> top<00:06:08.390> or<00:06:09.390> wherever<00:06:10.110> you

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
going to lay it on top or wherever you

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.630 
going to lay it on top or wherever you
want<00:06:10.470> it<00:06:10.530> i<00:06:10.740> think<00:06:10.800> i<00:06:11.100> might<00:06:11.250> do<00:06:11.460> something

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
want it i think i might do something

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.880 
want it i think i might do something
differently<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.300> i'll<00:06:13.229> have<00:06:13.410> it<00:06:13.560> you<00:06:13.650> look<00:06:13.740> up
