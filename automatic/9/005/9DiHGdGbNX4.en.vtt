00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.790 

you're<00:00:30.600> in<00:00:30.690> a<00:00:30.750> box<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.260> don't<00:00:31.530> know<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.710> many

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you're in a box I don't know how many

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.140 
you're in a box I don't know how many
thousands<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> these<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:32.580> are<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.970> there

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
thousands of these there are in there

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.030 
thousands of these there are in there
there's<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.080> dead<00:00:34.230> ones<00:00:34.410> down<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> bottom

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
there's some dead ones down the bottom

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.830 
there's some dead ones down the bottom
but<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> guess<00:00:35.310> that's<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.730> expected

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.990

underneath<00:01:20.710> those<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.280> answer<00:01:21.670> moved<00:01:21.880> in

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
underneath those this answer moved in

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.800 
underneath those this answer moved in
these<00:01:22.780> little<00:01:23.140> hands<00:01:24.390> running<00:01:25.390> all<00:01:25.510> around

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.359 
of this thing here I'm gonna have to
sweep<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.960> out<00:01:29.140> I'm<00:01:29.290> hoping<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.650> get<00:01:30.250> these

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
sweep that out I'm hoping to get these

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.890 
sweep that out I'm hoping to get these
guys<00:01:30.610> out<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:30.880> little<00:01:31.150> bit<00:01:31.360> now<00:01:31.540> I'll<00:01:31.690> sweep

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
them out of here I figure if I put some

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.460 
them out of here I figure if I put some
diatomaceous<00:01:34.420> earth<00:01:34.509> around<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.229> ground

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
diatomaceous earth around the ground

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.730 
diatomaceous earth around the ground
that<00:01:35.770> should<00:01:35.920> take<00:01:36.100> care<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.340> them

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.590 

that'll<00:01:39.250> solve<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.580> problem<00:01:40.000> also<00:01:40.150> keep<00:01:40.450> out

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
that'll solve the problem also keep out

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.780 
that'll solve the problem also keep out
some<00:01:40.780> beetles<00:01:41.110> too<00:01:41.410> I'm<00:01:42.370> gonna<00:01:42.490> set<00:01:42.670> this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
some beetles too I'm gonna set this

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.290 
some beetles too I'm gonna set this
thing<00:01:43.030> up<00:01:43.180> here<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.410> I'm<00:01:45.220> gonna<00:01:45.460> guess<00:01:46.060> I'll

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
thing up here and I'm gonna guess I'll

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.640 
thing up here and I'm gonna guess I'll
get<00:01:47.140> my<00:01:47.610> bill<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.180> smoke<00:01:50.080> already<00:01:50.260> and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
in there too we have a stream down over

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.520 
in there too we have a stream down over
on<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.060> property<00:02:01.510> down<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.050> little<00:02:02.320> farther

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530

few blocks of wood for them to land on
and<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.929> keep<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.260> block<00:02:11.440> off<00:02:11.620> lots<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.040> wood

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190

and that keep the block off lots of wood
from<00:02:12.310> going<00:02:12.640> out<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.000> actually<00:02:13.420> drill<00:02:13.690> holes

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
from going out you actually drill holes

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.400 
from going out you actually drill holes
in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.410> bucket<00:02:14.860> there<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.900> holes<00:02:17.110> when

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
in the bucket there and the holes when

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.810 
in the bucket there and the holes when
the<00:02:17.500> water<00:02:17.680> comes<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> water<00:02:18.610> will

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the water comes up then the water will

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.720 
the water comes up then the water will
come<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.239> there<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.560> water<00:02:21.489> won't

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
come out of there and the water won't

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.050 
come out of there and the water won't
overflow<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.510> take<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.989> rocks<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.950> wood<00:02:24.910> out

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
overflow and take the rocks the wood out

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.560 
overflow and take the rocks the wood out
with<00:02:25.270> it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
with it

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.000 
with it
