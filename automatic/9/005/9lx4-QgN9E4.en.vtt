00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.769
 the weather on such a day off can 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.630
 As you know, unfortunately not 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.400
 choose more influence than the climate 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.010
 On the other hand, you have to choose one of his 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.360
 employer and there is sebastian rudy 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.850
 everything done right 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.760
 A stiff breeze blows on the beach of San 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.310
 Pedro Del Plata goes for a photo shoot 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.529
 still in front of the lens and with a lot of wind 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.300
 In the hair our number six here in the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.200
 Spanish training camp his contract 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.510
 I was very extended until 2017 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.160
 confident and yes I'm happy now 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.540
 that it's the one that I have now 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.710
 one has signed as I said 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.829
 I'm looking forward to the next three 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.510
 Years together with the whole team 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.340
 has already indicated in the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.470
 last october has sebastian rudy 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.200
 signaled that he likes to kraichgau 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.930
 want to stay with tsg now 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.489
 so under roof and fold 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.620
 definitely evolve and it 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.180
 is important to me personally and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.650
 Of course, I want to be with the team 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.940
 achieve that much with the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.200
 descent have nothing to do and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.630
 then we'll see something in the next one 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.040
 years, the last one comes out 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 it ended very much already 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.280
 promising rudi stood in the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.229
 last four bundesliga games 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.760
 round trip in the start formation like 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.520
 used to defending 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.170
 the number 6 on the six exactly 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.580
 that one is today it was the first 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.620
 but it must of course ball the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.030
 I had to work on myself every day 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.310
 to achieve my goals 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.020
 to a place in the first eleven can 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.880
 you are sure to get used to it easily 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.430
 these goals are pretty fast 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.210
 Are defined 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.150
 of course, a root place so me 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.590
 Think every player playing football 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.270
 and that's important to a house 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.580
 to develop further I think there will be 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.470
 I fully attack and try that 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.540
 I showed on the key in the preliminary round 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.880
 I still have to show the fundament 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.409
 This is already laid out 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 new contract also brings new ones 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.619
 motivation 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.479
 that's on the beach something pulls well that 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.009
 Sebastian rudy takes a buy 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.580
 You also sign a contract 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.580
 not every day
