00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
that pressure and continue our ball

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.460 
that pressure and continue our ball
movement<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.540> thought<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> big<00:02:52.080> key<00:02:52.230> I

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.900 
movement I thought was a big key I
thought<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> key<00:02:53.160> was<00:02:53.190> your<00:02:53.459> ball<00:02:53.640> movement

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
they seem to be a pass to a past and a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.290 
they seem to be a pass to a past and a
half<00:02:56.040> late<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.520> all<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.820> three-point

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
half late on all your three-point

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.880

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
about before the game being an unselfish

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.490 
about before the game being an unselfish
