00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.910
We're opening up the Apple iMac 5K retina
display, stay tuned.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.480
Hey guys, welcome to Unboxing Live!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.800
I am Andru Edwards, this is the show that
brings you vicarious thrills through opening

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800
new gear.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.210
As we said, we're opening up the iMac with
5K Retina display.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.350
So, I'm gonna pull this up on to the counter
here and I might disappear behind it.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.920
Let's do the unboxing process from this point
of view because it's so big.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.660
Once we have it out of the box, obviously
we can move the box away.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.010
Talk about what we have got, so, Apple makes
it easy to open.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.089
They have got a sticker here you can just
pull the tab, just like that and now we can

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.260
open the top.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.469
And it actually opens from the other side,
so we'll swing it around so that you can see

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.030
other side of the box.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.059
There you go, that's the profile and the box
opens forward, like that.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.930
And there you have the iMac.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.930
This is going to be the accessories.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.732
Basically, the keyboard is going to be in
there as well as your choice of the chosen

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:14.640
trackpad which I did the Magic Trackpad or
the Apple Magic Mouse.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.150
So I chose the keyboard with wireless trackpad,
the Magic Trackpad because I think that's

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.640
the best input device for OS X.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.430
You have the box of accessories.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.290
This, I'm gonna peel it off the back, like
so.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.570
I'm going to turn it around, to give you a
look here on back.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.240
So, here is the Input/Output options that
you get with the iMac.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.140
First of all your headphone port here, you
got SD card reader, you can plug in your SD

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.910
card right in there.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.270
You have 4 USB 3.0 slots which is nice.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.099
You get 2 Thunderbort 2 ports as well as your
Ethernet port there for wired internet connections.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.920
This is where you're gonna plug in the power
port, right in that hole.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.819
And then right above it, right here, is the
compartment for your RAM.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.180
So you can easily get to your RAM and replace
it.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.180
I'm..

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.849
We're actually gonna do the next video that
we do on the iMac is gonna show you how to

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:26.849
upgrade the RAM.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.379
I'm gonna record that one out once I'm done
recording this unboxing.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.599
So, then you have got your speakers right
above it.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.540
So your speakers, are back here.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.439
Now, of course, up on front you have got the
27 inch retina 5K display.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:46.859
That is 14.7 million pixels, that's 4 times
as many pixels as the standard 27 inch iMac.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.510
So they have really packed this thing full
of pixels which is you know amazing to see.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.590
You got to see it to believe it.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.560
Even if I turned it on, the fact that you
are watching this video on 1080p wouldn't

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.319
give you the full effect of what it looks
like because this display is much much higher

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.319
than 1080p.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.349
Now on the inside, it comes with the latest
AMD graphics, quad core Intel Core i7 processor

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.319
at up to 4GHz, standard it comes with a Fusion
drive which is a hard drive paired with an

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.319
SSD.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:24.079
The iMac with retina 5K display starts at
2500 dollars, 2499 directly from Apple.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.409
Until next time, I am Andru Edwards.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.599
Thanks a lot for watching.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.450
That was the iMac with retina 5K display.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.430
Stay tuned for more of our vicarious thrills
right here on Unboxing Live.
