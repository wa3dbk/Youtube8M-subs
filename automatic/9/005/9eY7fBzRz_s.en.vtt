00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.429 
a carbon fiber structure so I'm going to
take<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.299> sensor<00:02:25.719> that<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.049> previously

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
take this sensor that we previously

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.649 
take this sensor that we previously
showed<00:02:27.090> place<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.329> inside<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:29.049> this<00:02:29.590> honeycomb

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
showed place it inside of this honeycomb

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.110 
showed place it inside of this honeycomb
carbon<00:02:31.659> or<00:02:31.870> composite<00:02:32.650> structure<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.340> then

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
carbon or composite structure and then

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.899 
carbon or composite structure and then
I'm<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.359> to<00:02:34.420> place<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:35.159> carbon<00:02:36.159> fiber<00:02:36.459> sheet

our lab reader and now Dale is going to

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:53.970 
our lab reader and now Dale is going to
do<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.700> read<00:02:47.459> using<00:02:48.459> an<00:02:49.420> RFID<00:02:50.139> signal<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.799> there

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
do a read using an RFID signal so there

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.159 
do a read using an RFID signal so there
we<00:02:54.099> have<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.879> tag<00:02:55.090> temperature<00:02:55.659> is<00:02:55.810> twenty

did<00:05:27.849> a<00:05:27.880> demonstration<00:05:28.120> of<00:05:29.020> temperature<00:05:29.560> here

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
did a demonstration of temperature here

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.070 
did a demonstration of temperature here
but<00:05:30.639> the<00:05:31.300> our<00:05:31.990> RFID<00:05:32.710> ASIC<00:05:33.580> also<00:05:34.090> has<00:05:34.720> an

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
but the our RFID ASIC also has an

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.810 
but the our RFID ASIC also has an
external<00:05:35.440> input<00:05:35.770> where<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.370> can<00:05:36.610> measure

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
external input where it can measure

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.040 
external input where it can measure
pressure<00:05:37.710> vacuum<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:38.979> other<00:05:39.520> things<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.240> we

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
pressure vacuum and other things that we

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.290 
pressure vacuum and other things that we
might<00:05:41.260> want<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.560> sense<00:05:41.889> so<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.820> addition<00:05:43.090> to

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
might want to sense so in addition to

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.330 
might want to sense so in addition to
temperature<00:05:43.870> it<00:05:44.139> can<00:05:44.320> do<00:05:44.470> one<00:05:44.680> other<00:05:44.830> sensing

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
temperature it can do one other sensing

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.940 
temperature it can do one other sensing
function<00:05:45.789> also<00:05:45.970> thanks<00:05:46.960> for<00:05:47.229> taking<00:05:47.560> time<00:05:47.710> to

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
function also thanks for taking time to

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.550 
function also thanks for taking time to
watch<00:05:47.979> our<00:05:48.280> video
