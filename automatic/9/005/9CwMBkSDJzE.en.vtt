00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
treated Jews very badly and so really I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130 
treated Jews very badly and so really I
didn't<00:00:53.220> have<00:00:53.310> any<00:00:53.490> idea<00:00:53.820> about<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.960> real

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
didn't have any idea about the real

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
didn't have any idea about the real
historical<00:00:55.829> Jesus<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.490> those<00:00:56.970> who<00:00:57.180> claim<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
historical Jesus and those who claim to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.319 
historical Jesus and those who claim to
be<00:00:57.630> followers<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.050> him<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:59.280> gave<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.060> bad

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

those<00:01:07.320> who<00:01:07.590> were<00:01:07.740> outside<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> community<00:01:09.090> but

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
those who were outside the community but

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.859 
those who were outside the community but
I<00:01:10.430> knew<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.880> bit<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.149> Christianity

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
I knew a little bit about Christianity

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.740 
I knew a little bit about Christianity
from<00:01:13.189> history<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.399> Crusades<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
Inquisition and even I believed that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.270 
Inquisition and even I believed that
Hitler<00:01:19.889> was<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.689> Christian<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.899> ever<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
Hitler was a Christian and ever that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.639 
Hitler was a Christian and ever that
Christianity<00:01:23.939> taught<00:01:24.179> some<00:01:24.509> how<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.229> Jews

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
Christianity taught some how the Jews

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.649 
Christianity taught some how the Jews
need<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.429> killed<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.969> we<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.389> to<00:01:27.509> treat

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
need to be killed and we have to treat

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.770 
need to be killed and we have to treat
them<00:01:27.749> badly<00:01:28.069> but<00:01:29.069> I<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.939> course<00:01:30.509> that's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
them badly but I know of course that's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.949 
them badly but I know of course that's
wrong<00:01:31.139> and<00:01:31.439> now<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.179> the<00:01:33.299> real<00:01:33.479> Jesus

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
wrong and now really that the real Jesus

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.230 
wrong and now really that the real Jesus
is<00:01:34.139> totally<00:01:34.560> different<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.729> Jesus<00:01:36.090> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
is totally different than the Jesus that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
is totally different than the Jesus that
people<00:01:36.539> have<00:01:36.780> claimed<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> follow<00:01:37.770> because

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
people have claimed to follow because

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
people have claimed to follow because
he's<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.240> who<00:01:39.359> said<00:01:39.600> live<00:01:40.109> it<00:01:40.259> your

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
he's the one who said live it your

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.219 
he's the one who said live it your
enemies<00:01:40.859> and<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.789> was<00:01:41.909> brought<00:01:41.969> up<00:01:42.229> really

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
enemies and so I was brought up really

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.199 
enemies and so I was brought up really
not<00:01:43.709> loving<00:01:44.009> Jesus<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.609> know<00:01:44.819> anything<00:01:45.119> about

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
not loving Jesus or know anything about

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.649 
not loving Jesus or know anything about
him<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.319> was<00:01:46.409> only<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:47.509> when<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.539> went

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
Jews believe in Jesus because of our

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.750 
Jews believe in Jesus because of our
traditions<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.410> not<00:02:49.760> traditional

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
because it's such a wonderful message

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.360 
because it's such a wonderful message
it's<00:06:30.250> so<00:06:30.400> simple<00:06:30.900> but<00:06:31.900> then<00:06:32.110> it<00:06:32.620> didn't<00:06:33.250> work

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
it's so simple but then it didn't work

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.800 
it's so simple but then it didn't work
out<00:06:33.490> the<00:06:33.550> way<00:06:33.670> that<00:06:33.790> I<00:06:34.000> wanted<00:06:34.390> to<00:06:34.540> account

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
out the way that I wanted to account

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.650 
out the way that I wanted to account
they<00:06:35.410> thought<00:06:35.680> I<00:06:35.860> was<00:06:35.980> crazy<00:06:36.040> and<00:06:36.820> how<00:06:37.420> can<00:06:37.600> I

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
they thought I was crazy and how can I

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.650 
they thought I was crazy and how can I
do<00:06:37.900> believe<00:06:38.200> in<00:06:38.320> Jesus<00:06:38.680> because<00:06:39.160> they

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
do believe in Jesus because they

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.330 
do believe in Jesus because they
couldn't<00:06:40.660> see<00:06:40.870> why<00:06:41.170> because<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.010> scripture

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
couldn't see why because the scripture

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.610 
couldn't see why because the scripture
says<00:06:42.670> the<00:06:43.600> scripture<00:06:43.930> says<00:06:44.140> that<00:06:44.170> Jewish

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
says the scripture says that Jewish

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.580 
says the scripture says that Jewish
people<00:06:44.650> are<00:06:45.040> blind<00:06:45.430> God<00:06:46.180> is<00:06:46.330> blinded<00:06:46.750> them<00:06:46.900> but

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
people are blind God is blinded them but

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.710 
people are blind God is blinded them but
God<00:06:48.130> can<00:06:48.310> open<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.760> eyes<00:06:48.880> of<00:06:48.910> Jewish<00:06:49.570> people

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
God can open the eyes of Jewish people

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.170 
God can open the eyes of Jewish people
and<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:50.710> believe<00:06:50.950> one<00:06:51.250> day<00:06:51.280> is<00:06:51.640> it<00:06:51.880> says<00:06:52.060> in

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180
