 can i touch galaxy note 3 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.300
 don't see if the cave blew 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.300
 pancake 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.670
 Good day friends in the hands of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 me a box with a smartphone which 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.670
 is one of the best among budget 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.610
 this is g-smart 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.980
 aku a1 gadget from gigabyte company price 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 its 7 thousand rubles if you were looking for 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.730
 smartphone on android that will be in 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590
 principle not so much sorry well there 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.540
 cyanogen mod left roll take on 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.210
 jogging in the evenings or sausage cats 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.920
 leave it is he is by the way for 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 that kind of money inside is set 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.910
 powerful enough stuffing and let 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.450
 external factors you are not very strong 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.010
 confuse 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.050
 on the box will not stop 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 documentation headphone adapter wire 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.470
 microusb and everything will start with the standard 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.379
 design and ergonomics 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.720
 the phone weighs 140 8 grams is too heavy 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.120
 here to say to there is worse but in the hand lies 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 surely a huge plus back soft-touch 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.050
 sockets to the touch very pleasant from the hands 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.510
 it does not slip easily 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.340
 detached I said with ease 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.680
 detached and under it we see two 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.500
 SIM card slots, batteries and slot 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.390
 for micro sd up to 32 gigabytes immediately 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.010
 warns you need a flash drive 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 since the built-in memory is only two 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.370
 gigabyte 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470
 thickness of the device is almost 10 millimeters on 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.450
 right side power button on the left 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.490
 volume controls can be found 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.890
 eyes closed quite noticeably 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 protrudes from the micro usb case input for 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.330
 the headphone is on top and during 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.520
 Charges similar to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.230
 you judge what it looks like on the face 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.480
 parts of standard touch buttons 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.520
 minimum home screen return and back 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.070
 top front camera by 3 tenths 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.440
 megapixels but thank god that she though 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.150
 there is a speaker on the back side 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.090
 I will tell you not the loudest but also not 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.840
 the quietest top flash and 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.030
 5 megapixel camera in principle 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 nothing special go to the screen 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.690
 our chagrin here tft lcd display with 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.520
 4 inch and a half inches from the top 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.710
 the colors are quite distorted but 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
 the best of course is ahead namely 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.820
 processor and we move so smoothly to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 performance running g-smart on 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.840
 quad processor mediatek 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.790
 mt6589 with a clock frequency of 1 2 gigahertz 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.260
 for an undemanding display such 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.270
 processor are great 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.400
 Let's go and test the interface toys 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.160
 installed smartphone almost 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.230
 naked android 4 2 1 almost does not lag 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.150
 And this is already fat plus scrolling in 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.820
 principle smoothly and that is also very happy 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.130
 let's start playable test wait coat 8 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.650
 already striking is the fact that at least he 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.780
 started slowing down no effects 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.410
 almost but at least played on high 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.660
 settings 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.220
 Immediately warn you not ultra since 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.560
 many smartphones of this third item 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.180
 just not supported now by the brand epic 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.880
 citadel smartphone pulls around 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.030
 fifty five frames per second 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.330
 impressive 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.280
 Antutu gave out 13500 62 points 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.680
 it's even cooler than galaxy s 2 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.080
 battery operation absolutely not surprised 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.970
 but rather the opposite 2000 milliamper hours 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.709
 barely half a day active 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.630
 use on and some glitches 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.880
 constant with a counter now he 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.400
 shows 25 percent and after a couple 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.620
 Seconds 7 I hope this software tank it 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.140
 correct we make a conclusion for 7 thousand 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.670
 blood you get powerful enough 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.680
 gadget able to pull all 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.720
 modern games for android instead 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.570
 get a screen for the quality of the year so 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.190
 2005 standard 5 megapixel camera 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.930
 and big enough weight 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.790
 but still it seems to me that in his 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.100
 price category is not the most 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.200
 worst choice at the very beginning I have already said 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.330
 for whom and for what from my point of view 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.530
 may need such a smartphone and your 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.170
