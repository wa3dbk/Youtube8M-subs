00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 For many centuries, Alderaan has been a symbol of hope for the Republic. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 But the Empire came ... 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And with one merciless blow, Alderaan knelt. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Time flies, and we have a little left to fight with the enemy. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 For those who are still standing, there is only one choice. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 We must fight to win or die. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 For the Republic! 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Red squad - Go! 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Come from the flank! 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.500
 Yes, our losses are irreparable, 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.550
 but we understand that we are fighting for good reason 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.500
 because from a single spark of courage a flame of hope can flare 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 and restore the world across the galaxy.
