00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
SMG player at heart in this game I

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
SMG player at heart in this game I
rarely<00:00:15.870> used<00:00:16.199> nades<00:00:16.500> or<00:00:16.650> wall<00:00:16.830> bangs<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.340> these

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
rarely used nades or wall bangs so these

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.010 
rarely used nades or wall bangs so these
are<00:00:17.609> pretty<00:00:17.789> much<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.330> useful<00:00:18.690> ones<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
are pretty much all the useful ones I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.080 
are pretty much all the useful ones I
could<00:00:19.289> remember<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:19.830> doing<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.250> basically

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
could remember when doing this basically

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.849 
could remember when doing this basically
the<00:00:21.480> order<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.810> chosen<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.439> things<00:00:22.710> on

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the order I've chosen to do things on

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529 
the order I've chosen to do things on
each<00:00:22.980> map<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.580> over<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> weird<00:00:24.269> stuff

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
each map is go over all the weird stuff

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
each map is go over all the weird stuff
like<00:00:24.750> solid<00:00:25.260> Jobson<00:00:25.710> small<00:00:26.160> helpful<00:00:26.609> things

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
like solid Jobson small helpful things

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.179 
like solid Jobson small helpful things
then<00:00:27.660> after<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> video<00:00:28.560> UNAIDS<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
then after that the video UNAIDS that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.769 
then after that the video UNAIDS that
are<00:00:29.279> useful<00:00:29.460> during<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> rounds<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
are useful during the rounds like this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.170 
are useful during the rounds like this
video<00:00:31.050> also<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.130> wallbangs<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.700> course<00:00:32.910> and

be<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.079> no<00:00:52.199> particular<00:00:52.320> order<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> start

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
be in no particular order so to start

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.670 
be in no particular order so to start
off<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:55.199> blue<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
off this one from back into blue if you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
off this one from back into blue if you
think<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> people<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.579> attacking<00:00:56.969> excited<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
think the people on attacking excited to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.740 
think the people on attacking excited to
slow<00:00:58.050> into<00:00:58.350> blue<00:01:02.120> most<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> names<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.719> have

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
slow into blue most of the names I have

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
slow into blue most of the names I have
on<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.170> map<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.500> mid<00:01:04.680> rounder<00:01:05.010> from<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
on this map for mid rounder from a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.469 
on this map for mid rounder from a
because<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> play<00:01:06.299> obviously

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
because that's where I play obviously

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719 
because that's where I play obviously
and<00:01:06.900> sometimes<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.650> aid<00:01:07.799> lift<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.520> one

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and sometimes have an aid lift this one

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.149 
and sometimes have an aid lift this one
just<00:01:08.909> goes<00:01:09.090> into<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> bottom<00:01:09.750> floor<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> blue

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.770 

this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.760> native<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this is a really good native a it's to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
this is a really good native a it's to
kill<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> person<00:01:16.229> who<00:01:16.470> always<00:01:16.619> sits<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.130> top

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
kill the person who always sits in top

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
kill the person who always sits in top
roof<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.450> from<00:01:18.570> top<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> can't<00:01:19.350> really

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
roof because from top a you can't really

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
roof because from top a you can't really
shoot<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.979> peaking<00:01:20.369> much<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.850> case<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
shoot more peaking much in case of a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
shoot more peaking much in case of a
sniper<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.659> watching<00:01:21.960> top<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> aim<00:01:23.159> here

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
sniper is watching top a so you aim here

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.830 
sniper is watching top a so you aim here
and<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> bounces<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> crack<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and it bounces through the crack in the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.710 
and it bounces through the crack in the
roof

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.270 

here's<00:01:33.720> another<00:01:33.840> nade<00:01:34.230> from<00:01:34.440> top<00:01:34.620> a<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:35.100> blue

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
here's another nade from top a into blue

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
here's another nade from top a into blue
from<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> same<00:01:35.760> position<00:01:36.210> much<00:01:36.750> easier<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
from the same position much easier you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
from the same position much easier you
just<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> lean<00:01:37.860> left<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.250> name<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
just have to lean left a name here and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.220 
just have to lean left a name here and
it<00:01:38.910> kills<00:01:39.120> people<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.510> might<00:01:39.660> be<00:01:39.840> sitting<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
it kills people you might be sitting in

to the spawn area and you know one is in

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
to the spawn area and you know one is in
the<00:02:21.060> B<00:02:21.210> link<00:02:27.080> now<00:02:28.080> here's<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.380> couple<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.770> maze

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
to sandbag basically just throw it in

00:02:32.760 --> 00:03:05.200 
to sandbag basically just throw it in
that<00:02:32.790> generalization<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.840> hope<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.260> lands

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.680 

another<00:03:19.100> nade<00:03:19.340> which<00:03:19.490> is<00:03:19.670> useful<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.180> attack<00:03:20.450> a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
another nade which is useful to attack a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.150 
another nade which is useful to attack a
this<00:03:21.110> time<00:03:21.350> if<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.590> think<00:03:21.770> somebody's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.570 

the<00:03:36.320> last<00:03:36.560> nade<00:03:36.800> I'm<00:03:36.950> going<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.190> show<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.550> a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
the last nade I'm going to show is a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.700 
the last nade I'm going to show is a
simplest<00:03:38.090> one<00:03:38.330> but<00:03:38.840> actually<00:03:39.170> very<00:03:39.350> effective

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
simplest one but actually very effective

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.620 
simplest one but actually very effective
if<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.370> no<00:03:40.490> escape<00:03:40.880> or<00:03:41.060> somebody's<00:03:41.450> on

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
if you no escape or somebody's on

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.330 
if you no escape or somebody's on
sandbags<00:03:42.170> watching<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.680> them<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.950> can<00:03:43.130> throw

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
sandbags watching a them you can throw

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.790 
sandbags watching a them you can throw
this<00:03:46.360> now<00:03:47.360> I'll<00:03:47.540> go<00:03:47.690> there's<00:03:47.960> some<00:03:48.080> ball<00:03:48.260> bangs

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
this now I'll go there's some ball bangs

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.140 
this now I'll go there's some ball bangs
most<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.190> these<00:03:49.280> are<00:03:49.340> scope<00:03:49.700> wall<00:03:49.940> bangs

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
most of these are scope wall bangs

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.550 
most of these are scope wall bangs
because<00:03:50.330> that's<00:03:50.570> really<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.840> only<00:03:50.960> gun<00:03:51.380> which

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
because that's really the only gun which

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.050 
because that's really the only gun which
I<00:03:51.680> think<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.040> good<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.520> my<00:03:52.640> opinion

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
I think it's good for it in my opinion

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.430 
I think it's good for it in my opinion
so<00:03:53.450> you've<00:03:53.570> got<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.780> try<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.020> line<00:03:54.260> yourself

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
so you've got to try and line yourself

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.960 
so you've got to try and line yourself
up<00:03:54.740> with<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.010> Waller<00:03:55.310> then<00:03:55.550> turn<00:03:55.790> around

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
up with this Waller then turn around

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.700 
up with this Waller then turn around
obviously<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.870> then<00:03:57.320> you've<00:03:57.440> got<00:03:57.530> like<00:03:57.560> a

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
obviously and then you've got like a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.380 
obviously and then you've got like a
mark<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> wall<00:03:58.430> where<00:03:58.640> you<00:03:58.670> can<00:03:58.910> name<00:03:59.090> it

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
mark in the wall where you can name it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.570 
mark in the wall where you can name it
will<00:04:00.170> do<00:04:00.320> like<00:04:00.530> ninety<00:04:00.860> six<00:04:01.070> damage<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.490> the
