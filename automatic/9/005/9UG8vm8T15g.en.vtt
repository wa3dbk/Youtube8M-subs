so you can click out of it once it's
done<00:04:59.729> burning<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.449> might<00:05:01.289> take<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.500> little

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740

done burning and might take a little
while<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.220> right<00:05:02.370> speeds<00:05:02.639> out<00:05:02.729> 4x

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
while to the right speeds out 4x

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:13.959 
have no idea how to do it though because

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.609 
have no idea how to do it though because
instructions<00:05:14.959> aren't<00:05:15.169> very<00:05:15.319> clear<00:05:15.739> and

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:17.619 
instructions aren't very clear and

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:20.529
