00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
lighting this is gonna be a little bit

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.839 
lighting this is gonna be a little bit

can<00:00:17.910> find<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.780> it<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.260> I'm<00:00:19.710> using<00:00:20.190> the

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
can find to see it but I'm using the

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.300 
can find to see it but I'm using the
Explorer<00:00:21.570> needles<00:00:21.960> unfortunately<00:00:22.710> because

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
Explorer needles unfortunately because

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.660 
Explorer needles unfortunately because
on<00:00:23.870> the<00:00:24.870> Mountaineer<00:00:25.260> cluster<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.950> have<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
on the Mountaineer cluster that I have I

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
on the Mountaineer cluster that I have I
don't<00:00:26.910> know<00:00:27.120> if<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:28.770> mountaineer

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
don't know if it's all the mountaineer

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.509 
don't know if it's all the mountaineer
clusters<00:00:29.630> but<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:31.290> use<00:00:31.500> stepper<00:00:31.800> motors<00:00:32.250> on

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
clusters but they use stepper motors on

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.119 
clusters but they use stepper motors on
that<00:00:32.940> cluster<00:00:33.449> so<00:00:33.839> the<00:00:34.170> shafts<00:00:34.769> on<00:00:35.039> the

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
that cluster so the shafts on the

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.910 
that cluster so the shafts on the
needles<00:00:35.460> were<00:00:35.670> too<00:00:36.000> long<00:00:36.379> to<00:00:37.379> be<00:00:37.500> able<00:00:37.589> to<00:00:37.739> use

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
needles were too long to be able to use

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
needles were too long to be able to use
them<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> cluster<00:00:40.769> that<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.949> have<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.179> I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
them on the cluster that I have so I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.349 
them on the cluster that I have so I
guess<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.929> forced<00:00:43.289> to<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.679> see

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359

my<00:02:08.119> dilemma<00:02:08.450> right<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.750> they<00:02:09.590> use<00:02:09.860> blue<00:02:10.310> and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
my dilemma right now they use blue and

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.690 
my dilemma right now they use blue and
red<00:02:10.820> film<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:12.940> change<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.950> trip<00:02:16.250> or<00:02:16.490> your

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
red film to change the the trip or your

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.600 
red film to change the the trip or your
odometer<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:18.260> white<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:20.830> I'm<00:02:21.830> using<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.370> red

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
odometer to white but I'm using the red

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.840 
odometer to white but I'm using the red
and<00:02:22.640> blue<00:02:23.000> film<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.960> can<00:02:24.350> barely<00:02:24.830> see<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
and blue film you can barely see the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.890 
and blue film you can barely see the
trip<00:02:26.510> odometer<00:02:27.310> if<00:02:28.310> at<00:02:28.490> all<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.480> can<00:02:29.630> see<00:02:29.810> it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
trip odometer if at all you can see it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.230 
trip odometer if at all you can see it
at<00:02:30.020> night<00:02:30.050> or<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:31.190> it's<00:02:31.370> really<00:02:32.120> dark

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
at night or when it's really dark

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.500 
at night or when it's really dark
outside<00:02:32.630> but<00:02:33.460> if<00:02:34.460> it's<00:02:34.640> daylight<00:02:35.030> out<00:02:35.240> you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
outside but if it's daylight out you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.240 
outside but if it's daylight out you
can't<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> trip<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.520> I'm<00:02:37.970> kind<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.570> in<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
can't see the trip so I'm kind of in a

can't see the trip so I'm kind of in a
dilemma<00:02:40.250> right<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:44.500> here<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.740> uh<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:46.370> just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
dilemma right now here is uh I just

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.100 
dilemma right now here is uh I just
turned<00:02:47.420> my<00:02:47.480> flashers<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.930> flashers<00:02:50.930> are

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
turned my flashers on the flashers are

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.340 
turned my flashers on the flashers are
