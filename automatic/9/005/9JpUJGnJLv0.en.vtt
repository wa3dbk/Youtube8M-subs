and the speed rating is the letter so

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.170 
and the speed rating is the letter so
you<00:03:32.459> got<00:03:32.579> 92<00:03:32.940> H<00:03:33.360> H<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.349> 130<00:03:34.980> miles<00:03:35.220> per<00:03:35.310> hour<00:03:35.519> to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
you got 92 H H is 130 miles per hour to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.710 
you got 92 H H is 130 miles per hour to
be<00:03:36.299> honest<00:03:36.599> with<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:38.639> 130<00:03:39.239> comes<00:03:39.540> into

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
be honest with you the 130 comes into

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.009 
be honest with you the 130 comes into
play<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:41.459> tire<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.970> rated<00:03:42.359> incrementally

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
play is this tire is rated incrementally

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.559 
play is this tire is rated incrementally
and<00:03:43.200> when<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.950> fails<00:03:44.250> after<00:03:44.609> traveling<00:03:45.239> 30

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
and when it fails after traveling 30

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.960 
and when it fails after traveling 30
minutes<00:03:46.019> at<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.470> speed<00:03:46.829> they<00:03:47.370> rated<00:03:47.670> at<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
minutes at that speed they rated at the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.289 
minutes at that speed they rated at the
high<00:03:48.120> speed<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.660> made<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.639> tire<00:03:50.910> can

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
high speed it made to so this tire can

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.509 
high speed it made to so this tire can
actually<00:03:51.690> go<00:03:51.840> 130<00:03:52.440> miles<00:03:52.799> per<00:03:52.889> hour<00:03:53.069> forever

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
actually go 130 miles per hour forever

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.059 
actually go 130 miles per hour forever
so<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.209> could<00:03:54.389> drive<00:03:54.510> 130<00:03:55.230> from<00:03:55.560> now<00:03:55.709> until<00:03:55.859> the

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
so I could drive 130 from now until the

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.690 
so I could drive 130 from now until the
cows<00:03:56.250> come<00:03:56.280> home

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
cows come home

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.330 
cows come home
tire<00:03:57.359> whenever<00:03:57.630> fail<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.350> only<00:03:58.620> if<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.920> exceed

psyching they got on the tire tread here
I<00:04:39.750> don't<00:04:39.870> know<00:04:40.020> if<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.229> easy<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.740> see

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
I don't know if it's easy to see

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.939 
I don't know if it's easy to see
there's<00:04:42.880> better<00:04:43.000> light<00:04:43.320> on<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> other<00:04:44.650> side

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
there's better light on the other side

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:53.589 
there's better light on the other side
possible

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.499 

it's<00:04:54.599> got<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.840> very<00:04:55.169> good<00:04:55.470> tread<00:04:56.009> pattern<00:04:56.430> and

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
it's got a very good tread pattern and

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.820 
it's got a very good tread pattern and
that<00:04:57.509> siping<00:04:57.960> is<00:04:58.050> supposed<00:04:58.259> to<00:04:58.319> channel<00:04:58.680> water

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
that siping is supposed to channel water

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.249 
that siping is supposed to channel water
out<00:04:59.129> in<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.370> way<00:04:59.520> if<00:04:59.759> that<00:05:00.210> may<00:05:00.360> very<00:05:00.569> edge<00:05:00.810> act

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
out in the way if that may very edge act

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.439 
out in the way if that may very edge act
as<00:05:01.560> shoulder<00:05:01.889> blocks<00:05:02.129> for<00:05:02.699> cornering<00:05:03.150> as<00:05:03.240> well

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
as shoulder blocks for cornering as well

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.869 
as shoulder blocks for cornering as well
so<00:05:04.020> these<00:05:04.650> tires<00:05:04.889> are<00:05:05.069> very<00:05:05.099> awesome<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.729> their

so these tires are very awesome in their

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.719 
so these tires are very awesome in their
turns<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.780> can<00:05:06.960> turn<00:05:07.199> very<00:05:07.470> easy<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:08.400> can<00:05:08.550> see

that Center Grove is flat and the tread
pattern<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:12.000> different<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.569> that<00:05:12.740> aids<00:05:13.740> in

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
pattern is different and that aids in

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.610 
pattern is different and that aids in
logic<00:05:14.819> longitudal<00:05:15.599> forces<00:05:15.960> which<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.229> braking

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
logic longitudal forces which is braking

that gives you awesome braking power

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.540 
that gives you awesome braking power
right<00:05:18.629> there<00:05:18.659> so<00:05:19.620> these<00:05:19.740> are<00:05:19.889> awesome<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.370> dry
