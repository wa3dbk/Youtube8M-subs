00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.520
 the buñuelos de viento are one of the 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.430
 typical sweets of the day of all 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.570
 saints and we can find them 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.760
 practically in all bakeries and 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.710
 city ​​bakeries the six 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.290
 filled with cream custard or cream 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.880
 I even truffle this time 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.920
 I will teach how to prepare with the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.140
 thermomix the fritters of winds 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.970
 stuffed with custard to make 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.660
 the mass of the fritters we are going to throw in 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.449
 the jug 100 grams of butter 250 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.200
 milliliters of milk a pinch of salt 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.870
 and 2 teaspoons of sugar we close the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.510
 pitcher and let's schedule four minutes 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.820
 100 degrees at speed 2 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.480
 when the time is up remove the lid and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.050
 toss out the 150 grams of flour 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.809
 and half a teaspoon of baking powder 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.079
 we close again and now we're going to put 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.119
 30 seconds at speed 4 when finished 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.799
 remove the lid and check that you have 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.409
 a mass like this that you see here 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.450
 then you remove the jug from the base and 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.840
 we're going to let it rest about five 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.340
 minutes to lose temperature one 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.500
 the five minutes have passed 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 return again to place the jar in its 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.330
 Place the lid without the goblet 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.390
 and upload the speed selector to 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.789
 speed 4 and we are going to incorporate a 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.009
 egg egg but until the 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.770
 first incorporated we will not add the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.080
 second and so on this is very 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.119
 important because otherwise the mass does not 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.580
 it will be fine I would recommend that 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.580
 you will throw 4 and when you have cast the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.750
 first four we open the glass and go 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.180
 Check the texture of the dough 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.610
 to check it, take a spatula and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.570
 When you pick it up, the dough does not fall 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.850
 the spatula is left 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.460
 this means that we still do not have it 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.290
 list the mass has to fall when the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.890
 take on the spatula in the form of 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.930
 tie so we close again and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.190
 we continue to incorporate eggs but now 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.500
 with great caution 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.290
 every time we cast one we open and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.320
 we check the texture of our dough and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.270
 look I already have it ready you see how it falls 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.540
 in the form of a tie as this is the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 texture that we want 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.190
 take it out a container 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.780
 and let it stand for 30 minutes covered 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.820
 meanwhile we are going to take abundant 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.730
 Sunflower oil in a pan that is 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.920
 honda and we're going to put it to warm up 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.240
 medium fire because to fry the duels 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.450
 the oil does not have to be very 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.420
 hot when we have it let's go 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.820
 throwing with a teaspoon of coffee 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.520
 portions of dough letting them fall 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.590
 gently over the oil and fry them 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.060
 small runs of about five as 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.740
 maximum 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.780
 do not worry if it takes a little 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.940
 will start to float in the oil and catch 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.070
 color this will make it sponge well by 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.890
 inside and then we can fill them with 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.140
 ease when they have a golden hue 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.660
 nice and you can take them out 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.480
 abundant absorbent paper if you like 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.860
 battered with a little sugar and cinnamon 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.420
 try to batter us right away because 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.850
 as you wait a long time since 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.340
 come out of the pan then do not catch well 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.440
 the sugar when you have finished 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.600
 fry them we are going to start filling 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.520
 This can happen to you that happened to me 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.110
 me that as it gets colder it 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.380
 they put a little 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.420
 this is normal , you will see how 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.640
 the fillings come back again to catch their 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.320
 I'm not going to stuff you with cream 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.240
 pastry there are several ways to 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.070
 fill them one of them is with a 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.380
 mouthpiece of these that are special 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.730
 for buñuelos you can find them with 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.100
 ease in any store 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.690
 specialized baking to me 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 personally they are not the ones that 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.560
 they like it because at the moment the cream 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
 pastry cools a little it costs 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.430
 quite a lot of work to go out and in some 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.950
 Occasion my pastry bag has broken 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.650
 by exerting pressure so that the 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.720
 cream and this is the other way in which 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.220
 I fill it that is the one I like the most 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.650
 which is nothing but a gun 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.750
 confectioner with these puts a little the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.910
 mouthpiece I spin it inside to make 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.100
 a little bit of hollow and I can 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.290
 fill them up very easily and without 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.750
 no effort and this is the way to 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.790
 Fill the fritters if you do not have 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.950
 neither of these two simply 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.230
 make a cut with the knife and 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.110
 fill them with a spoon too 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.150
 we will be great and although in this 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.860
 video showed us how to prepare the cream 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.980
 pastry so I'll leave for 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.630
 down here the link 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.930
 so you can see how I make the cream 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.940
 pastry with the thermomix and finally 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.650
 and to finish the buñuelos I'm going to 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.850
 sprinkle with a little sugar 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.110
 glas and we have them ready to eat 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.970
