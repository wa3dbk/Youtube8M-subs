00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
supply drops are essentially they give

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 
supply drops are essentially they give
you<00:00:18.090> new<00:00:18.270> gear<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.720> variations<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.650> weapons

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you new gear and variations of weapons

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.769 
you new gear and variations of weapons
that<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.250> sometimes<00:00:20.490> really<00:00:21.029> powerful<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that are sometimes really powerful and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.910 
that are sometimes really powerful and
I'm<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.050> sure<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.529> still<00:00:22.769> redeem

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I'm not sure if you can still redeem

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.859 
I'm not sure if you can still redeem
them<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.400> XP<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.000> if<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.750> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
them for XP but if you can then this is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
them for XP but if you can then this is
also<00:00:25.080> considered<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.710> very<00:00:25.920> good<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> rank

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
also considered a very good way to rank

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.490

description but with all of that out of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
description but with all of that out of
the<00:00:41.579> way<00:00:41.730> let's<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.270> right<00:00:42.540> into<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> video

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the way let's get right into the video

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.760 
the way let's get right into the video
all<00:00:43.440> right

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
all right

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
all right
so<00:00:43.980> essentially<00:00:44.520> usually<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.539> go<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so essentially usually when we go to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
so essentially usually when we go to
earn<00:00:46.079> supply<00:00:46.680> drops<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.250> order<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.760> them

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
earn supply drops in order to get them

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.670 
earn supply drops in order to get them
you<00:00:48.210> need<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> complete<00:00:48.840> challenges<00:00:49.110> whether

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you need to complete challenges whether

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.130 
you need to complete challenges whether
that<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> unmultiplied<00:00:50.449> EXO<00:00:51.449> survival<00:00:51.629> or

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that the unmultiplied EXO survival or

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.869 
that the unmultiplied EXO survival or
even<00:00:52.379> campaign<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.850> easier

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
even campaign but there is a much easier

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
even campaign but there is a much easier
way<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> earn<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
way to earn them and this is going to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
way to earn them and this is going to
sound<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.250> far<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> need

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sound pretty far off but what you need

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
sound pretty far off but what you need
to<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.930> die<00:00:58.320> before<00:00:58.559> anyone<00:00:58.920> else<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
to do is die before anyone else the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
to do is die before anyone else the
first<00:01:00.000> round<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.629> any<00:01:00.840> game<00:01:01.140> mode<00:01:01.350> basically

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
first round of any game mode basically

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
first round of any game mode basically
sludge<00:01:02.280> him<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.789> accounted<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
sludge him or have accounted for the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.939 
sludge him or have accounted for the
fact<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.650> terrible

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
fact that there are some really terrible

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
fact that there are some really terrible
players<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.729> game<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
players in this game and so if you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.969 
players in this game and so if you
happen<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> first<00:01:07.500> death<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
happen to get the first death of

whatever game you're playing in there is
a<00:01:09.570> pretty<00:01:09.869> high<00:01:10.049> chance<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> receive

it that if you're not really actively
playing<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> game<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.220> getting<00:01:23.400> objectives

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
playing the game or getting objectives

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.609 
playing the game or getting objectives
and<00:01:24.119> getting<00:01:24.330> kills<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.200> unlikely

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and getting kills it's very unlikely

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.200 
and getting kills it's very unlikely
this<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.130> work<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> essentially

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this will work because you essentially

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
this will work because you essentially
need<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> show<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> system<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.439> trying

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
need to show the system you're trying

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.950 
need to show the system you're trying
but<00:01:29.009> you're<00:01:29.340> dying<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.909> away<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.750> all

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
but you're dying right away and so all

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
but you're dying right away and so all
you<00:01:31.049> want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.619> play<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> do

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you want to do is play like you do

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.219 
you want to do is play like you do
normally<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> very<00:01:33.509> start<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> each

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
normally but at the very start of each

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
normally but at the very start of each
game<00:01:34.500> die<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.189> away<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.640> obviously<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
game die right away and obviously you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.550 
game die right away and obviously you
can<00:01:36.420> ensure<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.869> happens<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.350> using

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
can ensure this happens by using

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
can ensure this happens by using
lightweight<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.189> overclock<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
lightweight and overclock and you just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
lightweight and overclock and you just
want<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> rush<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.200> EXO<00:01:40.530> suit

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
want to rush in there with your EXO suit

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
want to rush in there with your EXO suit
and<00:01:40.979> play<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.610> normally<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.150> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and play like you do normally like I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
and play like you do normally like I
said<00:01:42.570> I'd<00:01:42.750> say<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.020> trick<00:01:43.259> works<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.740> 50%

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
said I'd say this trick works about 50%

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.800 
said I'd say this trick works about 50%
of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> time<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.210> definitely<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.630> nice

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
of the time so it's definitely a nice

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.210 
of the time so it's definitely a nice
trick<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> start<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
trick to use and at the start of the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.440 
trick to use and at the start of the
game<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.579> die<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.759> you'll<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
game just die and you'll see that you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
game just die and you'll see that you
are<00:01:48.630> getting<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:49.170> supply<00:01:49.560> drops<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.430> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
are getting more supply drops and like I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.280 
are getting more supply drops and like I
said<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.000> isn't<00:01:51.240> gonna<00:01:51.509> work<00:01:51.720> every<00:01:52.110> single

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
said this isn't gonna work every single

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.679 
said this isn't gonna work every single
time<00:01:52.549> however<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.790> death<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.210> game<00:01:54.479> is

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
time however one death a game is

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.480 
time however one death a game is
definitely<00:01:55.170> worth<00:01:55.320> some<00:01:55.590> new<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> possibly

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
definitely worth some new and possibly

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.459 
definitely worth some new and possibly
rare<00:01:56.759> gear<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> guys<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.990> tell<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> do

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
rare gear and as you guys can tell I do

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.260 
rare gear and as you guys can tell I do
have<00:01:58.799> quite<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> few<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.520> these<00:01:59.610> supply<00:01:59.969> drops

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
have quite a few of these supply drops

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
have quite a few of these supply drops
from<00:02:00.450> using<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.990> method<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.500> obviously<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
from using this method but obviously I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.830 
from using this method but obviously I
don't<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.630> being

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
don't have all of them with that being
