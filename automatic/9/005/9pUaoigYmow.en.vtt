00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.740
 Now you can 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:10.450
 today we are going to explain how to spend pokÃ©mons 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.120
 from a game boy advance to another game 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.219
 boy advance the game boy advance to well 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.220
 boy color can not be passed due to 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.900
 that the corrector is of the link cable that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 is different and in this one has a 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.140
 little eyelash that in the very color does not have 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.259
 we should buy an adapter a cable 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.200
 to adapt it here and that can 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:36.930
 connect to the color 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.930
 let's go on we turn on the game 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.800
 we give him 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.800
 to start 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.360
 and we are going to appear here 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:00.990
 in the upper part of the pokemon center 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.990
 we have to go to the middle shelf 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.700
 and give it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 As you can see in the wireless connector, 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.810
 is connected we have to connect the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810
 cable 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 she's here 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.750
 OK 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.330
 tells us he wants is a change to the pokemon 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.960
 we say that if in this we put center 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.180
 exchange 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.119
 they are different versions one is the 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 pokemon sapphire and the other the red pokemon 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.840
 fire we will give to save because 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.840
 it demands it from us 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.630
 now we confirm the connection 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.290
 and we can enter the room 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 now we have to put in an embolism 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 a player on one side 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.470
 and the other on the other side 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.470
 we wait for the connection 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.040
 now we choose the pokemon that we want 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.700
 exchange on one side and another 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.700
 well 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.569
 this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.450
 this month we are going to exchange 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.489
 and now on the other time I'm going 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.830
 we take the other pokemon that we want 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.260
 to exchange 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.220
 we give you to accept 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.220
 and we wait 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.710
 As you can see here , they are already 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.610
 exchanging 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.610
 other 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.980
 and we have it 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.700
 then the game is awaited 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.879
 we will leave 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.540
 and we left the room with both 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.540
 players 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.070
 now if we go to the start menu 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.070
 and we put pokemon 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:26.640
 we will see the exchanged pokemon that we 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.960
 has already arrived at our data from the 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.160
 console 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.160
 and that's how easy it is
