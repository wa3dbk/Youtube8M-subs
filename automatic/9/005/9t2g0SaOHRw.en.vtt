that let's just double-check yep after
that<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:01.020> got<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that we got this it think it's for the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
you got like the ship the shell think

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.850 
you got like the ship the shell think
yeah<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:16.150> where<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.660> this<00:04:16.990> is<00:04:17.590> where<00:04:17.740> the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
yeah this is where the this is where the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.610 
yeah this is where the this is where the
crane<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.700> then<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.970> collect<00:04:19.900> stuff<00:04:20.350> out

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
crane is and then you collect stuff out

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.650 
crane is and then you collect stuff out
of<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.920> like<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.400> think<00:04:21.730> out<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> water<00:04:22.360> and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
of the like I think out of the water and

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.640 
of the like I think out of the water and
you<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:23.670> break<00:04:24.670> them<00:04:24.910> or<00:04:25.150> move<00:04:25.330> them<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:26.230> and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
you just break them or move them so and

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.560 
you just break them or move them so and
it<00:04:27.220> kind<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.520> looks<00:04:27.760> like<00:04:27.850> there's<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.270> free

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
it kind of looks like there's a free

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.230 
it kind of looks like there's a free
item<00:04:28.930> there<00:04:29.170> if<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:30.010> can<00:04:30.190> see<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.430> for<00:04:31.120> like

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
item there if you can see that for like

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.630 
item there if you can see that for like
right<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:31.960> front<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.490> fish<00:04:33.790> logo<00:04:34.270> so

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
right in front of that the fish logo so

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.920 
right in front of that the fish logo so
probably<00:04:36.640> go<00:04:36.850> check<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.270> out<00:04:37.330> first<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
probably go check that out first and

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.510 
probably go check that out first and
there's<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.200> kind<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.530> catalog<00:04:39.070> right<00:04:39.280> there

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
there's a kind of catalog right there

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.110 
there's a kind of catalog right there
too<00:04:39.730> so<00:04:40.480> and<00:04:40.930> then<00:04:41.920> we<00:04:42.220> head<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.910> last

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
too so and then we head on to the last

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.190 
too so and then we head on to the last
picture<00:04:43.470> which<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.940> one<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.120> games<00:04:46.450> as<00:04:46.810> you

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200
