00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello this week our topic 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.349
 will focus on the robot war the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.370
 do you know that since man has 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.259
 invented the machine 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 he only improved it for 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.520
 to satisfy his hegemonic ambitions and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 this to the detriment of the populations 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.410
 civilians who became the first 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 victims of modern wars 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.269
 actually today threatening 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.250
 high tech raptors fly days and a half to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.949
 on top of many countries where fight 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.770
 the united states and their allies 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.450
 these drones are used to spy on 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.879
 bombed as well as to commit 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.540
 targeted attacks like the assassination of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.860
 Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli army 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.170
 the most common species of these drones 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 and that of predators that are endowed 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 video cameras and sensors to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 remote-controlled infrared from a base 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.680
 American to more than ten thousand 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 kilometers away these drones and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.739
 some others proliferate the pentagon 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.760
 ten years ago was about fifty 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.710
 today he has more than 7000 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.049
 us air force causes more 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.750
 remote pilots for these drones that 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 two pilots of fighter bombers 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.990
 the billions of dollars for 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.390
 research and development 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.310
 the species is changing rapidly 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.610
 is experimenting with drones now 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 space like the x 37b of the us air 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.920
 completely robotic force 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.840
 this new weapon can destroy 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.680
 enemy satellites is launched since 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 the space of nuclear warheads in the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.180
 air base of wight peterson in the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.250
 law be experienced customs 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.620
 miniaturized that reproduce 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.600
 the flight of birds and insects as well as 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.430
 wing beats in the future 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.260
 warrior scenarios are provided for 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.180
 swarms of drones did for 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.660
 spy missions or attacks 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.580
 target the Americans experiment in 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.460
 same time at strong benning robots 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.800
 of combat among those 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.450
 gladiator a caterpillar vehicle equipped 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.110
 machine guns firing on 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.229
 goals 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.810
 spotted by telecameras another 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.550
 robot cosson for zone fighting 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.190
 urban and ready to use 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.020
 it's a little robot armed with 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.030
 machine guns that shoots when it's elie 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.120
 camera spots a human silhouette 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.520
 he was already experienced in Iraq while 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.920
 that a similar model is used in 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.650
 israel along the border with the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.540
 za in order to face their opinions 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.459
 public authorities since the war of 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.989
 vietnam bears less and less the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.910
 return of coffins from soldiers 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.950
 americans the united states use 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.220
 so their technological superiority 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.140
 in wars that she even like you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.330
 surely have understood the war 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.310
 robotic facilitates the extension of 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.340
 military operations and increases the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.500
 number of civilian casualties 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.570
 in the end we may wonder whether the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.739
 real robots are not also those 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.320
 who walk like automatons 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.580
 behind it was abbey you are who can 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.580
 bring them back to the precipice
