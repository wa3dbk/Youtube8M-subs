we<00:06:56.700> have<00:06:56.880> a<00:06:56.910> lot<00:06:57.120> of<00:06:57.150> problems<00:06:57.540> and<00:06:57.720> they<00:06:57.870> have

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
we have a lot of problems and they have

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.770 
we have a lot of problems and they have
to<00:06:58.140> be<00:06:58.670> tackled<00:06:59.670> but<00:06:59.730> as<00:06:59.850> a<00:06:59.880> filmmaker<00:07:00.330> I<00:07:00.570> think

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
to be tackled but as a filmmaker I think

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.870 
to be tackled but as a filmmaker I think
he<00:07:00.870> was<00:07:01.050> going<00:07:01.320> for<00:07:01.650> a<00:07:01.710> world<00:07:02.010> of<00:07:02.160> view<00:07:02.280> rather

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
he was going for a world of view rather

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.300 
he was going for a world of view rather
than<00:07:03.120> just<00:07:03.360> being<00:07:03.540> very<00:07:03.750> nationalistic<00:07:04.310> right

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
than just being very nationalistic right

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.340 
than just being very nationalistic right
