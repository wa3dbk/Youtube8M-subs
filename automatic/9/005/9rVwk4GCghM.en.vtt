ok<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.890> show<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.070> how<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.310> do<00:00:02.580> a

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 
ok I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.700 
ok I'm going to show you how to do a
diagonal<00:00:03.689> mesh<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:05.220> attaching<00:00:05.730> too

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
diagonal mesh this is for attaching too

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.370 
diagonal mesh this is for attaching too
sparse<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:08.490> are<00:00:08.910> like<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.420> ok<00:00:09.990> right<00:00:10.230> in

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
sparse that are like this ok right in

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.600 
sparse that are like this ok right in
the<00:00:10.440> centers<00:00:10.860> where<00:00:11.040> we're<00:00:11.280> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.580> our

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
the centers where we're going to do our

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.419 
the centers where we're going to do our
diagonal<00:00:12.179> my<00:00:12.360> gosh<00:00:12.570> no<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.469> start<00:00:13.740> off<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.219> is

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
diagonal my gosh no we start off with is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.330 
diagonal my gosh no we start off with is
a<00:00:14.549> timber<00:00:15.150> hitch<00:00:15.529> which<00:00:16.529> as<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.920> showed<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
a timber hitch which as I showed you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.070 
a timber hitch which as I showed you
guys<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.910> another<00:00:18.000> video<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.650> simple

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
guys in another video is very simple

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.040 
guys in another video is very simple
look<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:24.890> ok<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.220> simple<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.900> right

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
look like this ok I simple all right

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.390 
look like this ok I simple all right
here<00:00:28.439> start<00:00:28.949> making<00:00:29.250> turns

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.500 

on<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:35.240> side<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.470> road<00:00:37.180> this<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.330> what's

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
on this side of the road this is what's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.720 
on this side of the road this is what's
going<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.830> give<00:00:39.830> you<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.010> friction<00:00:40.430> around

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
going to give you the friction around

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.160 
going to give you the friction around
the<00:00:41.170> word<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.350> area<00:00:42.710> okay<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:44.870> were<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.110> see

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
the word the area okay you were to see

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.160 
the word the area okay you were to see
how<00:00:45.470> easy<00:00:45.680> that<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:46.450> see<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.720> loop<00:00:47.870> right<00:00:48.110> here

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
how easy that is see the loop right here

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.770 
how easy that is see the loop right here
with<00:00:48.560> this<00:00:48.680> end<00:00:48.950> can<00:00:49.130> move<00:00:49.250> freely<00:00:49.550> through

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
with this end can move freely through

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.450 
with this end can move freely through
and<00:00:50.780> then<00:00:51.020> turn<00:00:51.230> turn<00:00:51.440> turn<00:00:51.650> turn<00:00:51.860> turn<00:00:52.130> round

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
and then turn turn turn turn turn round

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.930 
and then turn turn turn turn turn round
ok<00:00:52.940> that's<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.660> timber<00:00:53.990> hitch<00:00:54.640> all<00:00:55.640> right<00:00:55.850> now

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
ok that's a timber hitch all right now

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.430 
ok that's a timber hitch all right now
Italian<00:00:58.940> that's<00:00:59.090> not<00:00:59.270> around<00:00:59.690> where<00:01:00.290> these

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
Italian that's not around where these

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.120 
Italian that's not around where these
two<00:01:00.680> spars<00:01:01.540> cross<00:01:02.540> ok<00:01:03.230> imagine<00:01:03.590> this<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:04.010> in

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
two spars cross ok imagine this is in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.520 
two spars cross ok imagine this is in
the<00:01:04.190> middle<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:04.490> an<00:01:04.640> ex<00:01:04.930> Trussell<00:01:05.930> your

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
the middle of an ex Trussell your

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.560 
the middle of an ex Trussell your
pioneering<00:01:07.040> project<00:01:07.280> ok<00:01:07.790> that's<00:01:08.210> not<00:01:08.270> so

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
pioneering project ok that's not so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.290 
pioneering project ok that's not so
useful<00:01:08.979> ok<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.520> timber<00:01:10.790> hitch<00:01:10.940> starts

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
useful ok so the timber hitch starts

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.990 
useful ok so the timber hitch starts
like<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.690> right<00:01:11.900> when<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.200> excess<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:13.000> over

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
like that right when the excess and over

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.900 
like that right when the excess and over
the<00:01:14.090> center<00:01:14.360> ok<00:01:15.250> now<00:01:16.250> we're<00:01:16.460> going<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.700> make

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
the center ok now we're going to make

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.140 
the center ok now we're going to make
some<00:01:16.970> turns<00:01:18.190> in<00:01:19.190> order<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.460> begin<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.790> lashing

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
some turns in order to begin the lashing

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.670 
some turns in order to begin the lashing
itself<00:01:20.510> we're<00:01:21.260> going<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.470> go<00:01:23.170> like<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.410> up

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
itself we're going to go like this up

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.859 
itself we're going to go like this up
well<00:01:25.070> that's<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:25.520> stuff<00:01:25.760> slipping<00:01:26.240> not<00:01:26.720> only

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
well that's so stuff slipping not only

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:27.880 
well that's so stuff slipping not only
you<00:01:26.990> Timbers<00:01:27.320> going<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.500> be<00:01:27.619> much<00:01:27.860> more

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
you Timbers going to be much more

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.859 
you Timbers going to be much more
friction<00:01:28.369> than<00:01:28.610> these<00:01:28.790> little<00:01:29.360> dolls<00:01:29.540> here

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
friction than these little dolls here

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.480 
friction than these little dolls here
they're<00:01:30.080> kind<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.320> painted<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:30.740> priestly<00:01:31.100> so

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
they're kind of painted in priestly so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.980 
they're kind of painted in priestly so
let<00:01:32.330> me<00:01:32.390> go<00:01:32.509> one<00:01:33.280> two<00:01:34.420> three<00:01:35.420> turns<00:01:35.720> around

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
let me go one two three turns around

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.690 
let me go one two three turns around
this<00:01:36.200> way<00:01:37.119> all<00:01:38.119> right<00:01:39.430> then<00:01:40.430> I'm<00:01:40.520> going<00:01:40.670> to

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
this way all right then I'm going to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.470 
this way all right then I'm going to
come<00:01:40.880> through<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.800> way<00:01:44.050> then<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.200> go<00:01:45.320> one

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
come through this way then you go one

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.340 
come through this way then you go one
two<00:01:48.460> three<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.060> don't<00:01:50.270> want<00:01:50.390> your<00:01:50.510> rope<00:01:50.930> to

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
two three you don't want your rope to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.220 
two three you don't want your rope to
overlap<00:01:52.340> itself<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.540> want<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.050> be

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
overlap itself you want it to be

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.230 
overlap itself you want it to be
side-by-side<00:01:54.560> as<00:01:55.310> you're<00:01:55.850> making<00:01:55.940> these

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
side-by-side as you're making these

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.610 
side-by-side as you're making these
turns<00:01:56.570> ok<00:01:57.130> now<00:01:58.130> take<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.330> sparse<00:02:00.230> this<00:02:00.440> way

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
turns ok now take the sparse this way

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.550 
turns ok now take the sparse this way
we're<00:02:00.800> going<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.950> begin<00:02:01.070> Frampton<00:02:01.730> ok<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:02.600> they

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
we're going to begin Frampton ok so they

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.250 
we're going to begin Frampton ok so they
come<00:02:03.800> one<00:02:04.630> two<00:02:06.070> three<00:02:07.070> fraps<00:02:07.959> now<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.019> can

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
come one two three fraps now you can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.330 
come one two three fraps now you can
finish<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.769> off<00:02:10.040> with<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.850> clove<00:02:11.330> hitch<00:02:12.340> route

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
finish this off with a clove hitch route

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.580 
finish this off with a clove hitch route
either<00:02:13.640> spar<00:02:14.060> I'm<00:02:14.690> going<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.959> do<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.110> quick<00:02:15.320> one

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
either spar I'm going to do a quick one

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.820 
either spar I'm going to do a quick one
here<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.390> finish<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:18.290> off

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.820 

okay<00:02:24.390> very<00:02:25.390> simple<00:02:25.750> that's<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.290> diagonal

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
okay very simple that's the diagonal

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.650 
okay very simple that's the diagonal
lash<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.670> going<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.880> be<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> center<00:02:28.390> of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
lash it's going to be in the center of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.070 
lash it's going to be in the center of
an<00:02:29.140> extra<00:02:29.650> sell<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.160> buy<00:02:30.390> extra<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.570> I'll<00:02:31.780> make

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
an extra sell and buy extra so I'll make
