00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.590 
known as team bullet train
here's<00:00:27.779> Manette<00:00:28.109> Express<00:00:30.050> again<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.380> another

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
here's Manette Express again in another

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.130 
here's Manette Express again in another
bullet<00:00:33.600> train<00:00:33.780> mode

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
bullet train mode

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.299 
bullet train mode
what<00:00:35.100> were<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> expect<00:00:35.610> her<00:00:37.070> if<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.190> get

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
what were you expect her if we get

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.410 
what were you expect her if we get
close-up<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.719> he<00:00:39.809> says<00:00:40.340> max

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
close-up on here we see that he says max

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.729 
close-up on here we see that he says max
Cybertron<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> he<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> max<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> again<00:00:46.649> he

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
Cybertron so he is the max and again he

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220 
Cybertron so he is the max and again he
has<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.570> connector<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
has the little connector here as the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400 
has the little connector here as the
other<00:00:49.350> three<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:50.660> he's<00:00:51.660> more<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> flat<00:00:52.140> nosed

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
other three do he's more of a flat nosed

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
other three do he's more of a flat nosed
bullet<00:00:52.739> train<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:55.670> guess<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
bullet train I guess a little bit more I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.689 
bullet train I guess a little bit more I
guess<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.649> more<00:00:58.890> aerodynamic

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
guess this will be more aerodynamic

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.780 
guess this will be more aerodynamic
I<00:00:59.789> guess<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.239> no<00:01:02.690> waves<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.870> yellow

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
I guess so no waves you know yellow

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
I guess so no waves you know yellow
white<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.820> blue<00:01:08.330> tires<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.890> three

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
white and blue tires right here three

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.600 
white and blue tires right here three
wheels<00:01:11.100> quite<00:01:11.640> nicely<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.290> again<00:01:16.890> like

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
wheels quite nicely and then again like

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.859 
wheels quite nicely and then again like
the<00:01:17.759> other<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> he<00:01:18.750> has<00:01:18.840> no

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the other two you know he has no

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.289 
the other two you know he has no
gimmicks<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.470> anything<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
gimmicks or anything this is what you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.960 
gimmicks or anything this is what you
see<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.580> that's<00:01:23.580> pretty<00:01:23.880> much
