00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
starting us you know probably double the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
starting us you know probably double the
average<00:01:28.010> stack<00:01:28.400> day<00:01:28.610> one<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:29.990> sent<00:01:30.230> to

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
maintain more than average till about

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.550 
maintain more than average till about
day<00:01:32.330> three<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.810> then<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:32.990> had<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.260> really

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560

really<00:01:35.930> with<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.080> short<00:01:36.290> not<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.530> short<00:01:36.800> stack

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
really with a short not a short stack

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.590 
really with a short not a short stack
but<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> an<00:01:37.550> average<00:01:37.880> stack<00:01:38.120> or<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.330> little

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
but a an average stack or a little

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.140 
but a an average stack or a little
lesson<00:01:38.750> average<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.850> think<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.940> turning

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150
