me whilst and racing here at the current

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
me whilst and racing here at the current
time<00:01:44.759> obviously<00:01:45.060> isn't<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.630> live<00:01:45.840> commentary

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
time obviously isn't a live commentary

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
time obviously isn't a live commentary
but<00:01:46.560> while<00:01:46.740> stars<00:01:46.950> racing<00:01:47.130> us<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
but while stars racing us like I'm in

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
but while stars racing us like I'm in
first<00:01:48.240> position<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.439> saying<00:01:49.649> I'm

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
first position here and it's saying I'm

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
first position here and it's saying I'm
in<00:01:49.890> fourth<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> happening<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.509> was

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
in fourth what is happening here I was
most<00:01:52.229> certainly<00:01:52.380> confused<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.820> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
most certainly confused here I was like

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
most certainly confused here I was like
okay<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> guess<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.079> keep<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> see
