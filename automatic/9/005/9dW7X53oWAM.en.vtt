weight<00:00:37.550> on<00:00:38.180> all<00:00:38.210> of<00:00:38.450> our<00:00:38.570> campers<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.230> I<00:00:39.260> think

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
weight on all of our campers and I think

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.590 
weight on all of our campers and I think
that<00:00:39.590> we've<00:00:39.710> achieved<00:00:39.860> that<00:00:40.330> all<00:00:41.330> of<00:00:41.480> our

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
that we've achieved that all of our

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.480 
that we've achieved that all of our
units<00:00:41.870> are<00:00:41.990> now<00:00:42.140> carbon<00:00:42.500> compliant<00:00:43.280> which

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
units are now carbon compliant which

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.920 
units are now carbon compliant which
means<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:43.940> we've<00:00:44.060> taken<00:00:44.210> out<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.510> lot<00:00:44.720> of<00:00:44.780> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
means that we've taken out a lot of the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.280 
means that we've taken out a lot of the
carcinogens<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.390> toxins<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.630> formaldehydes

that exists in a lot of RVs and to my

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.450 
that exists in a lot of RVs and to my
knowledge<00:00:51.440> we're<00:00:51.770> probably<00:00:51.980> one<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.340> only

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
