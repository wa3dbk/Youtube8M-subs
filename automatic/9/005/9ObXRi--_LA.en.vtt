who<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.540> wondering<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:04.290> i<00:02:04.439> play<00:02:04.649> manual

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
who are wondering if i play manual

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.289 
who are wondering if i play manual
it's<00:02:05.650> like<00:02:05.860> manual<00:02:06.220> shift<00:02:06.430> or<00:02:06.580> automatic<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:07.240> do

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
it's like manual shift or automatic I do

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.809 
it's like manual shift or automatic I do
play<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.780> manual<00:02:08.470> shift<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.250> think<00:02:09.520> it's<00:02:09.670> better

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
play a manual shift I think it's better

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.300 
play a manual shift I think it's better
that<00:02:09.940> way<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.410> can<00:02:11.560> tell<00:02:11.740> i<00:02:11.770> play<00:02:12.010> manual

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
that way and you can tell i play manual

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.520 
that way and you can tell i play manual
shift<00:02:12.520> because<00:02:12.790> when<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> play<00:02:13.510> automatic<00:02:14.319> it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
shift because when you play automatic it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.670 
shift because when you play automatic it
does<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.340> shifts<00:02:15.850> right<00:02:15.940> at<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.660> red<00:02:17.110> red<00:02:17.650> line

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
does it shifts right at the red red line

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.490 
does it shifts right at the red red line
like<00:02:18.190> sometimes<00:02:18.670> when<00:02:18.940> I'm<00:02:19.060> doing<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.020> my

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
like sometimes when I'm doing it on my

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.860 
like sometimes when I'm doing it on my
speedometer<00:02:21.100> goes<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.850> pass<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.420> red<00:02:22.569> into

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
speedometer goes to pass the red into

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780 
speedometer goes to pass the red into
the<00:02:22.959> red<00:02:23.110> zone<00:02:23.140> which<00:02:23.590> will<00:02:23.800> make<00:02:23.920> your<00:02:24.160> motor

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
the red zone which will make your motor

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.590 
the red zone which will make your motor
spot<00:02:25.209> but<00:02:25.450> Google<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.680> weird<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.600> even

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
spot but Google like it's weird and even

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.199 
spot but Google like it's weird and even
when<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.310> downshifting<00:02:30.310> like<00:02:30.850> it's

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
when I'm like downshifting like it's

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.120 
when I'm like downshifting like it's
it's<00:02:31.569> not<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> cleanest<00:02:32.050> shifts<00:02:32.590> compared<00:02:33.010> to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it's not the cleanest shifts compared to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.000 
it's not the cleanest shifts compared to
automatic<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:33.910> i<00:02:34.270> prefer<00:02:34.900> manual<00:02:35.590> it's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
automatic but i prefer manual it's

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.810 
automatic but i prefer manual it's
better<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.489> it's<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.730> dog<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.690> cheap<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.820> as

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
better and it's a dog is cheap but as

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.130 
better and it's a dog is cheap but as
you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.120> me<00:02:40.180> first<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.690> I'm<00:02:40.750> there's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
the masker he was trying to hit me a bit

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.770 
the masker he was trying to hit me a bit
but<00:02:45.280> about<00:02:45.580> he<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.000> did<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> wide<00:02:46.330> turn<00:02:46.510> there

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
but um if there's one of them and later

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.240 
but um if there's one of them and later
on<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.260> think<00:02:50.440> he<00:02:50.500> tries<00:02:50.680> think<00:02:50.860> that's<00:02:51.040> why<00:02:51.160> I'm

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
on I think he tries think that's why I'm

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.400 
on I think he tries think that's why I'm
slowing<00:02:51.580> down<00:02:51.730> as<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.209> see<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.810> even

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
slowing down as you can see because even

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.500 
slowing down as you can see because even
when<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.620> guys<00:02:53.739> were<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.040> new<00:02:54.130> races<00:02:54.519> then

when you guys were in the new races then

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.970 
when you guys were in the new races then

game at Hagel's a customer and then

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580 
game at Hagel's a customer and then
it'll<00:03:03.730> show<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.910> guy<00:03:04.090> below<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.660> second

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
it'll show the guy below the second

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320 
it'll show the guy below the second
place<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.890> replace<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.280> forth<00:03:06.459> well<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.239> tells

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
place to replace and forth well it tells

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.640 
place to replace and forth well it tells
you<00:03:07.510> how<00:03:07.630> many<00:03:07.780> feet<00:03:07.930> behind<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.319> air<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.560> if

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
you how many feet behind the air so if

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.720 
you how many feet behind the air so if
you're<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.830> way<00:03:08.980> ahead<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.370> don't<00:03:09.519> need<00:03:09.610> to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
you're a way ahead you don't need to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.180 
you're a way ahead you don't need to
worry<00:03:09.880> though<00:03:10.570> slow<00:03:11.350> down<00:03:11.590> because<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.010> can

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
worry though slow down because you can

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.310 
worry though slow down because you can
slow<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.579> it's<00:03:13.209> better<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.570> slow<00:03:13.750> down<00:03:13.930> and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320

me a bit but see they would do anything

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.640 
me a bit but see they would do anything
because<00:03:58.209> i<00:03:58.450> was<00:03:58.570> driving<00:03:58.870> slower<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.470> safer

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
because i was driving slower and safer
