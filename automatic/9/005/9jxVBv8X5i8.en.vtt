than knife can write in but no problems

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.689 
than knife can write in but no problems
right<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.559> it's<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.890> sturdy<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
right there and it's pretty sturdy in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
right there and it's pretty sturdy in
terms<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.449> feel<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.320> fact

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
terms of feel just because of the fact

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
terms of feel just because of the fact
that<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.890> made<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> cast<00:01:02.760> aluminum

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that this is made out of cast aluminum

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
that this is made out of cast aluminum
now<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> uses<00:01:04.199> what's<00:01:04.379> called<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> rolling

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
now this uses what's called the rolling

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
now this uses what's called the rolling
not<00:01:05.100> mechanism<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.030> basically<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.780> treat

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
not mechanism but basically just treat

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
not mechanism but basically just treat
it<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.140> an<00:01:07.229> access<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.740> basically<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> can

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it like an access lot basically you can

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
it like an access lot basically you can
open<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.210> handed<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.080> by<00:01:10.170> pulling

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
open up one handed and just by pulling

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
open up one handed and just by pulling
this<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:10.860> tab<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.150> disengage

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
this little tab down you can disengage

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.719 
this little tab down you can disengage
the<00:01:12.930> lock<00:01:13.110> angle<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> easily<00:01:14.130> one-handed

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the lock angle is it easily one-handed

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.219 
the lock angle is it easily one-handed
the<00:01:15.330> only<00:01:15.509> problem<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> rolling<00:01:16.200> log

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the only problem with the rolling log

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
the only problem with the rolling log
system<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> i'll<00:01:16.890> give<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.460> yeah<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
system that i'll give it is yeah it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.460 
system that i'll give it is yeah it
looks<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> access<00:01:19.049> lock<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.439> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
looks just like the access lock and you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
looks just like the access lock and you
have<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.860> tension<00:01:20.070> spring<00:01:20.369> right

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
have the little tension spring right

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.710 
have the little tension spring right
here<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> problem<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.390> it's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
here but the problem with that is it's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
here but the problem with that is it's
only<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
only on one side so it's not on the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
only on one side so it's not on the
reverse<00:01:24.509> side<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.530> great<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.860> you're

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
reverse side so it's great if you're

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
reverse side so it's great if you're
right-handed<00:01:26.159> no<00:01:27.090> luck<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.750> your

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
right-handed no luck for you if your

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
right-handed no luck for you if your
lefty<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.710> want<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.159> knife<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
open it either way closing it might be a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380 
open it either way closing it might be a
bit<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.399> issue<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.149> every<00:01:51.360> time

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
bit of an issue because in so every time

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.260 
finger in order to close a knife it's
doable<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.460> quite<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.820> convenient<00:01:57.149> as

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
doable but not quite as convenient as

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.149 
doable but not quite as convenient as
having<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.960> either<00:01:58.320> side<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:58.950> use

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
having it on either side so you can use

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.870
