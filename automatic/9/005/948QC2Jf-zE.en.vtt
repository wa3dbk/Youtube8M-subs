00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.750
 there are schools where people live and 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.330
 you get more than just the degree 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 the truth is that you are a little girl 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 between the Mexican army and the day that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.910
 this opportunity was opened so that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.180
 the women came in and I decided to go in and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.050
 participate to train me as an officer 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.050
 of the logical army 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.900
 in the heroic military school the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.970
 cadets wake up at five o'clock 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.440
 morning to clean up and fix your 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.440
 bedrooms meticulously 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.300
 with the low temperatures in this part 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.060
 of the federal district the warmth of coffee 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.150
 and a plate with hot food is fine 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.010
 received by the cadets 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.140
 the flags are hoisted during the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 first list of the day and the cadets 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.630
 they march singing and whistling to classes 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 more than anything is difficult everything depends on 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.100
 how you eat it, maybe you can 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.640
 said to be the internal environment 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.190
 but not 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.950
 only one must be mentalized that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.110
 comes to come for a goal and what 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.930
 and that for something is here is very father 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.009
 you learn many things that in no other 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.009
 side are you going to sell maybe 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.830
 with respect to the enemy 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.390
 the secondary lieutenant school is whose 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.240
 equivalence is the degree in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.120
 military sciences upon graduation come 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.910
 specialized in one of the weapons the 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.730
 which are cavalry infantry 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.460
 artillery armored weapon engineers 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.890
 combat and intendants who chose 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 the cavalry weapon are instructed in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.460
 the care and maintenance of their 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.920
 horses the biggest challenge of the cadet 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 when it comes here it is precisely losing 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.740
 the fear of the horse so they are 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 horses that have a little more than 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.900
 stamps are high are strong streets 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.239
 as you well know the generality of the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.000
 people get used to having contact with 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.590
 the horses but not so close and not 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.510
 with this type of horses who are 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 they find in armored weapon also 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.600
 they carry out their virtual exercises 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.610
 to save ammunition and make a 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.170
 area recognition conditions 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.950
 neutralize or destroy any enemy 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.950
 that we find 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.320
 not all physical effort fatigue the cadet 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.320
 Many expect their favorite hour 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.920
 i 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.989
 the truth I think physical education 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.250
 it's a part where we do what 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.079
 what we like the teams are like 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.079
 sports we despair 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.540
 it is after eating that the cadets 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.670
 they face their activities that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.990
 they require a physical effort like 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.670
 trainings in the fields of 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.670
 obstacles and military training 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.280

 head where they are planned and made 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.700
