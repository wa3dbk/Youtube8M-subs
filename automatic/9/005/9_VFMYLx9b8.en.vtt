00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.979 
genuinely I wanted this role so sadly
and<00:02:36.860> what<00:02:37.760> character<00:02:38.270> I<00:02:38.300> was<00:02:38.570> going<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.780> play<00:02:38.900> I

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
and what character I was going to play I

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.880 
and what character I was going to play I
wanted<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.530> be<00:02:39.620> part<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:40.040> historian<00:02:40.750> life

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
wanted to be part of historian life

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.250 
wanted to be part of historian life
because<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.280> Medicaid<00:02:44.019> written<00:02:45.019> really

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
because it's the Medicaid written really

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.460 
because it's the Medicaid written really
well<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.680> mean<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.250> kind<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:48.019> did<00:02:48.440> that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
well I mean it's kind of that I did that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.930 
well I mean it's kind of that I did that
you<00:02:48.800> know<00:02:48.890> they<00:02:49.010> are<00:02:49.130> just<00:02:49.280> all<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.550> teenagers

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
you know they are just all the teenagers

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.479 
you know they are just all the teenagers
but<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.989> add<00:02:51.200> an<00:02:51.380> element<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:52.130> magic

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
but then this is add an element of magic

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.000 
but then this is add an element of magic
and<00:02:53.030> power<00:02:53.600> struggles<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.590> think<00:02:54.830> that's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
and power struggles and I think that's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.370 
and power struggles and I think that's
what's<00:02:55.250> going<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.700> play<00:02:55.910> with<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.510> kind<00:02:57.350> of

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
what's going to play with you kind of

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.870 
what's going to play with you kind of
get<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.860> they're<00:02:58.340> both<00:02:58.580> worlds

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
get to do they're both worlds

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.080 
get to do they're both worlds

Iraq and then sort of with one another
as<00:05:02.439> the<00:05:02.529> series<00:05:02.679> progresses<00:05:04.709> how<00:05:05.709> the<00:05:05.769> colvin

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
as the series progresses how the colvin

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.309 
as the series progresses how the colvin
kind<00:05:06.429> of<00:05:06.489> develops<00:05:06.879> yeah<00:05:07.119> I<00:05:07.749> think<00:05:07.929> at<00:05:08.199> the

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
kind of develops yeah I think at the

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.379 
kind of develops yeah I think at the
moment<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.860> n<00:05:09.009> is<00:05:09.159> very<00:05:09.519> much<00:05:09.639> like<00:05:09.939> the<00:05:10.149> leader

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
moment I n is very much like the leader

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.119 
moment I n is very much like the leader
of<00:05:10.509> the<00:05:10.689> pack<00:05:10.899> and<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:11.259> think<00:05:11.319> that's<00:05:11.769> going<00:05:12.039> to

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
of the pack and I think that's going to

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.859 
of the pack and I think that's going to
change<00:05:12.339> I<00:05:12.610> think<00:05:12.789> that<00:05:12.909> dynamic<00:05:13.449> who's

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:13.869 
change I think that dynamic who's

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:16.589 
change I think that dynamic who's
leading<00:05:14.459> who's<00:05:15.459> kind<00:05:15.789> of<00:05:15.819> following<00:05:16.119> i<00:05:16.360> think

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
leading who's kind of following i think

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.649 
leading who's kind of following i think
is<00:05:16.689> gonna<00:05:16.839> be<00:05:17.099> different<00:05:18.099> like<00:05:18.399> besides<00:05:19.089> and
