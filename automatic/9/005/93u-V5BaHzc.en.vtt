00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:19.710
 here is the camera nils this time 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.100
 right from the top never quite high I want 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.039
 time to move out and prove that this 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.609
 small transparent micoach archer the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.910
 fastest of 1 is moderate at the iphone 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910
 the time 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.600
 Of course I had a lot to compare 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.200
 but I'll just take it from you 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:53.449
 white like cottbus 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:01:01.969
 now he is fast nine seconds 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.969
 it costs about a snail ok 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.900
 25 5 seconds 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:24.479
 that is not bad we are still bad 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:26.990
 two seconds from 123 50 24 24 against 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.990
 beat 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:47.920
 and who would have a little 12 the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.240
 good jobs because they cost longer though 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.149
 what now we have enough 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.229
 but you realize strangely the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.229
 is not the fastest version 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:13.260
 residue 27 5 seconds 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:13.260
 What does this tell us ok
