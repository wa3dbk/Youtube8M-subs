00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
alright guys this is the moment you have

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.220 
alright guys this is the moment you have
been<00:00:22.160> waiting<00:00:22.310> for<00:00:22.669> our<00:00:23.239> we<00:00:23.660> were<00:00:23.779> running

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
been waiting for our we were running

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.819 
been waiting for our we were running
today<00:00:24.470> extensively<00:00:25.400> that<00:00:25.880> Troy<00:00:26.829> industries

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
today extensively that Troy industries

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.970 
today extensively that Troy industries
rail<00:00:28.550> system<00:00:29.239> a<00:00:29.270> lower<00:00:29.869> portion<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.680> the

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
rail system a lower portion and the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.250 
rail system a lower portion and the
upper<00:00:31.610> portion<00:00:31.849> which<00:00:32.300> is<00:00:32.329> replacing<00:00:32.960> a

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
upper portion which is replacing a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.610 
upper portion which is replacing a
standard<00:00:33.739> gas<00:00:34.100> tube<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:35.690> we<00:00:36.140> had<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.350> nice

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
standard gas tube and we had a nice

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.119 
standard gas tube and we had a nice
little<00:00:37.190> endpoint<00:00:37.820> t1<00:00:38.390> mounted<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.890> see

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
little endpoint t1 mounted to it to see

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.490 
little endpoint t1 mounted to it to see
how<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:40.550> our<00:00:40.850> upper<00:00:41.660> portion<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.140> working

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
how this our upper portion is working

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.410 
how this our upper portion is working
like<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.309> it<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.640> completely<00:00:44.150> different

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
like so it is a completely different

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.220 
like so it is a completely different
take<00:00:45.020> on<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.950> rail<00:00:46.100> from<00:00:46.820> what<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.570> see<00:00:47.840> for

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
take on the rail from what you see for

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.630 
take on the rail from what you see for
example<00:00:48.260> compared<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.489> X<00:00:49.670> 47<00:00:50.450> from<00:00:50.600> TDI<00:00:51.020> or

example compared to the X 47 from TDI or

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760 
example compared to the X 47 from TDI or
even<00:00:52.640> Zhang<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.060> Rea<00:00:53.239> also<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.930> Troy<00:00:54.170> went

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
even Zhang it Rea also the Troy went

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.770 
even Zhang it Rea also the Troy went
totally<00:00:55.310> different<00:00:55.730> way<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.210> shape<00:00:56.450> of<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
totally different way the shape of the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.720 
totally different way the shape of the
rail<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.200> completely<00:00:57.739> different<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.309> you

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
rail is completely different and you

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.090 
rail is completely different and you
have<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.880> spawns<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.660> real<00:00:59.870> estate<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.800> calls

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
have a spawns of real estate it calls

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.509 
have a spawns of real estate it calls
the<00:01:01.280> rail<00:01:01.489> or<00:01:01.790> let's<00:01:02.480> visit<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.530> our<00:01:03.559> gravity

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the rail or let's visit to our gravity

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.030 
the rail or let's visit to our gravity
this<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.390> extended<00:01:06.140> extended<00:01:06.560> length

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
this is the extended extended length

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.800 
this is the extended extended length
version<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:09.680> will<00:01:10.430> say<00:01:10.759> that<00:01:10.790> from<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
version and I will say that from the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.679 
version and I will say that from the
economics<00:01:12.799> point<00:01:13.159> of<00:01:13.369> view<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:14.180> rail<00:01:14.479> is

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
economics point of view this rail is

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.469 
economics point of view this rail is
extremely<00:01:15.259> comfortable<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.850> can<00:01:16.880> extend

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
extremely comfortable and you can extend

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.169 
extremely comfortable and you can extend
that<00:01:17.840> see<00:01:18.499> climb<00:01:18.740> grape<00:01:19.039> or<00:01:19.310> scorpion<00:01:20.030> grape

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
that see climb grape or scorpion grape

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.359 
that see climb grape or scorpion grape
whatever<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:20.630> wanna<00:01:20.780> call<00:01:20.899> it<00:01:21.079> and<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:22.219> can

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
whatever you wanna call it and you can

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.949 
whatever you wanna call it and you can
exercise<00:01:22.639> that<00:01:22.969> grape<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.450> engage<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
exercise that grape and engage the

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.080 
exercise that grape and engage the
targets<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:24.619> transfer<00:01:25.280> from<00:01:25.490> target<00:01:25.909> to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
targets and transfer from target to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.840 
targets and transfer from target to
target<00:01:26.240> very<00:01:26.479> effectively<00:01:27.469> I<00:01:27.709> mean<00:01:28.459> you<00:01:28.609> have

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
target very effectively I mean you have

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.539 
target very effectively I mean you have
really<00:01:29.389> control<00:01:29.779> over<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.139> machine<00:01:30.549> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
really control over the machine and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.309 
really control over the machine and
that's<00:01:31.789> because<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.079> much

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
that's because you have that so much

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.639 
that's because you have that so much
surface<00:01:33.859> on<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.520> rail<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:35.929> thing<00:01:36.289> which

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
surface on the rail the one thing which

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.609 
surface on the rail the one thing which
I'll<00:01:36.859> point<00:01:37.159> out<00:01:37.429> are<00:01:37.869> these<00:01:38.869> little<00:01:39.289> they

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
I'll point out are these little they

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.219 
I'll point out are these little they
call<00:01:39.859> that<00:01:40.009> squids<00:01:40.609> I<00:01:40.849> will<00:01:41.359> strongly<00:01:41.779> advise

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
call that squids I will strongly advise

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.469 
call that squids I will strongly advise
to<00:01:42.529> have<00:01:42.770> these<00:01:43.069> because<00:01:43.999> they<00:01:44.179> are<00:01:44.209> heat

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
to have these because they are heat

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.499 
to have these because they are heat
resistant<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:46.399> rail<00:01:46.670> because<00:01:46.939> if<00:01:47.240> so

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
resistant and that rail because if so

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.779 
resistant and that rail because if so
it's<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.109> long<00:01:48.349> and<00:01:48.679> you're<00:01:48.829> very<00:01:49.130> close<00:01:49.459> to

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's so long and you're very close to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.660 
it's so long and you're very close to
this<00:01:50.090> gas<00:01:50.389> block<00:01:50.749> it's<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.740> good<00:01:51.920> idea<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.310> have

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
this gas block it's a good idea to have

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.669 
this gas block it's a good idea to have
that<00:01:52.700> extra<00:01:53.060> layer<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.509> protection<00:01:53.719> however

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
that extra layer of protection however

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.089 
that extra layer of protection however
today<00:01:55.399> Paul<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:56.569> had<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.380> I<00:01:57.499> didn't<00:01:57.889> have

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
today Paul this I had and I didn't have

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.999 
today Paul this I had and I didn't have
any<00:01:58.369> issues<00:01:58.849> at<00:01:58.999> all<00:01:59.149> when<00:01:59.749> shooting<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.380> didn't

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
any issues at all when shooting I didn't

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.159 
any issues at all when shooting I didn't
have<00:02:01.159> any<00:02:01.369> problems<00:02:01.909> with<00:02:01.999> with<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.810> burners

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
have any problems with with the burners

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:05.289 
have any problems with with the burners
or<00:02:03.349> anything<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.979> most<00:02:04.459> of<00:02:04.669> the<00:02:04.789> time<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:04.999> was

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
or anything and most of the time I was

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.169 
or anything and most of the time I was
just<00:02:05.539> using<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:06.189> Troy<00:02:07.189> forward<00:02:07.759> grip<00:02:07.969> as<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
just using the Troy forward grip as a

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.719 
just using the Troy forward grip as a
support<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.929> then<00:02:09.410> placing<00:02:10.130> my<00:02:10.220> fingers<00:02:10.550> on

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
support and then placing my fingers on

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.699 
support and then placing my fingers on
the<00:02:10.849> rail<00:02:11.000> but<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.540> didn't<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.110> any<00:02:12.290> problems

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the rail but I didn't have any problems

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.229 
the rail but I didn't have any problems
at<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.370> heat<00:02:13.580> did<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.030> had<00:02:14.209> any

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
at all with the heat did you had any

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.050 
at all with the heat did you had any
issues<00:02:14.810> no<00:02:15.380> no<00:02:15.830> I'd<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.640> our<00:02:16.819> heat

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
issues no no I'd just like our heat

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.690 
issues no no I'd just like our heat
torture<00:02:17.420> test<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.870> mean<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.590> did<00:02:18.920> vented<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
torture test I mean it it did vented it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.550 
with Dodd rail and I would say that it
workouts<00:02:33.480> extremely<00:02:34.170> well

to it we can do that they got the
opening<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.940> as<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.180> said<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.690> out<00:03:48.959> in

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
opening for it as I said that is out in

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.170 
opening for it as I said that is out in
all<00:03:49.380> these<00:03:49.620> holes<00:03:49.680> on<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.519> all<00:03:50.700> these<00:03:50.880> little

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
all these holes on in all these little

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.559 
all these holes on in all these little
holes<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:52.500> can<00:03:52.709> put<00:03:53.220> these<00:03:53.670> little<00:03:54.419> rail

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
holes you can put these little rail

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.289 
holes you can put these little rail
sections<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.950> all<00:03:56.250> these<00:03:56.459> could<00:03:56.760> be<00:03:56.880> covered

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
sections so all these could be covered

did<00:04:23.580> tighten<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.090> but<00:04:24.389> maybe<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.200> didn't

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
did tighten it but maybe we didn't

did tighten it but maybe we didn't
tighten<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:26.010> enough<00:04:26.280> will<00:04:26.639> be<00:04:26.760> definitely

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
tighten it enough will be definitely

any other observations about it

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.210 
any other observations about it
not<00:04:39.520> really<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:40.090> will<00:04:40.630> say<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.110> we<00:04:42.040> did

not really I will say the we did

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.770 
not really I will say the we did
maintain<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.610> good<00:04:42.790> zero<00:04:43.090> even<00:04:43.450> with<00:04:43.600> our

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
maintain a good zero even with our

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.110 
maintain a good zero even with our
Castle<00:04:44.200> not<00:04:44.320> issue<00:04:44.500> that's<00:04:45.370> gia<00:04:45.700> that<00:04:45.820> is

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
Castle not issue that's gia that is

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.630 
Castle not issue that's gia that is
correct<00:04:46.540> even<00:04:46.900> when<00:04:47.350> when<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.860> royalty<00:04:48.520> know

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
correct even when when the royalty know

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.610 
correct even when when the royalty know
become<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.000> little<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:49.450> loose<00:04:49.630> there<00:04:50.500> was

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
become a little bit loose there was

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.180 
become a little bit loose there was
still<00:04:51.400> not<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.360> much<00:04:52.420> of<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.990> play<00:04:53.230> to<00:04:53.770> affect

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
still not that much of a play to affect

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.270 
still not that much of a play to affect
the<00:04:54.610> zero<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.330> we<00:04:56.170> were<00:04:56.290> able<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.590> heat<00:04:56.980> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
the zero and we were able to heat the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.600 
the zero and we were able to heat the
you<00:04:57.700> know<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:57.880> third<00:04:58.350> IPSC<00:04:59.380> tiger<00:05:00.070> targets

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
you know to third IPSC tiger targets

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.240 
you know to third IPSC tiger targets
without<00:05:00.820> without<00:05:01.540> any<00:05:01.780> issues<00:05:02.230> so<00:05:02.800> that's

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
without without any issues so that's

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.790 
without without any issues so that's
kind<00:05:03.490> of<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.790> but<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.630> know<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.840> really<00:05:05.440> should

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
sure that this castle nut is really

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.380 
sure that this castle nut is really
really<00:05:13.450> tight<00:05:14.190> other<00:05:15.190> than<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:15.760> what<00:05:16.360> I

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
really tight other than this what I

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.950 
really tight other than this what I
would<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:17.020> say<00:05:17.260> too<00:05:17.320> is<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:19.180> know<00:05:19.210> it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960

would like to say too is the you know it
is<00:05:20.170> the<00:05:21.160> trial<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.610> not<00:05:21.820> for<00:05:22.060> everyone

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
is the trial is not for everyone

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.960 
is the trial is not for everyone
I<00:05:22.720> understand<00:05:23.380> finna<00:05:23.710> take<00:05:23.890> a<00:05:24.100> walk<00:05:24.400> when<00:05:24.820> you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
I understand finna take a walk when you

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.700 
I understand finna take a walk when you
see<00:05:25.210> something<00:05:25.480> around<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.200> going<00:05:26.530> like

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
see something around it and going like

see something around it and going like
this<00:05:26.920> it<00:05:27.400> may<00:05:27.580> turn<00:05:27.640> some<00:05:28.150> people<00:05:28.180> off<00:05:28.630> but<00:05:29.410> I

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
this it may turn some people off but I

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.340 
this it may turn some people off but I
think<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.490> kind<00:05:30.790> of<00:05:30.880> like<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.360> think<00:05:31.420> sexy

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
think so I kind of like it I think sexy

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.540 
think so I kind of like it I think sexy
okay<00:05:32.680> oh<00:05:32.920> I<00:05:33.670> like<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.240> because<00:05:34.540> it's<00:05:34.720> different

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
okay oh I like it because it's different

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.410 
okay oh I like it because it's different
exactly<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.640> know<00:05:36.760> it's<00:05:37.000> something

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
exactly you know it's something

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.150 
exactly you know it's something
different<00:05:37.570> from<00:05:37.930> what<00:05:38.170> we<00:05:38.500> are<00:05:38.530> usually

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
different from what we are usually

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.390 
different from what we are usually
seeing<00:05:39.460> either<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:39.970> square<00:05:40.390> box<00:05:40.690> right<00:05:41.500> or<00:05:41.800> you

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
seeing either a square box right or you

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.700 
seeing either a square box right or you
have<00:05:42.670> some<00:05:43.000> like<00:05:43.300> an<00:05:43.540> oval<00:05:43.990> shape<00:05:44.350> almost

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
have some like an oval shape almost

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.820 
have some like an oval shape almost
Regan's<00:05:45.760> and<00:05:45.880> this<00:05:46.540> is<00:05:46.720> very<00:05:46.960> round<00:05:47.230> that<00:05:47.560> our

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
Regan's and this is very round that our

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.140 
Regan's and this is very round that our
economics<00:05:48.700> are<00:05:48.880> fantastic<00:05:49.780> on<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:51.150> it

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
economics are fantastic on it and it

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.010 
economics are fantastic on it and it
works<00:05:52.420> well

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
works well

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.440 
works well
so<00:05:53.470> we'll<00:05:53.770> see<00:05:54.100> we'll<00:05:54.400> continue<00:05:54.670> to<00:05:55.060> use<00:05:55.210> it

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
so we'll see we'll continue to use it

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.570 
so we'll see we'll continue to use it
we'll<00:05:55.810> continue<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.410> evaluate<00:05:56.470> this<00:05:57.100> rail<00:05:57.310> our

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
we'll continue to evaluate this rail our

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.390 
we'll continue to evaluate this rail our
so<00:05:58.240> far<00:05:58.480> so<00:05:58.720> good<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.260> I<00:05:59.350> think<00:05:59.410> so<00:05:59.770> it's<00:05:59.950> it's

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
so far so good and I think so it's it's

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.940 
so far so good and I think so it's it's
a<00:06:00.520> good<00:06:00.700> product<00:06:01.000> at<00:06:01.360> this<00:06:01.540> point<00:06:01.950> but

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
a good product at this point but

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.430 
a good product at this point but
definitely<00:06:03.550> will<00:06:03.700> pay<00:06:04.030> better<00:06:04.630> attention<00:06:04.750> to

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
definitely will pay better attention to

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.220 
definitely will pay better attention to
