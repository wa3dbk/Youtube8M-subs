00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.930
 well here we are here in this party 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.389
 run take care have you seen him yet leader 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 season 8 1526 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 in his current run, he can be seen here 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.279
 see nearby 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.289
 It was May 5 not so long ago I showed this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 the result well we will take it and sit on 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.720
 navigate the muta and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 also a participant of this race and remind 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 still she is a bronze medalist 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.399
 olympic games also here i have 2 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.780
 until the result of season 819 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.020
 These are reference points see what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.200
 will please today well shelf each in my opinion 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 in general has not yet run this year but for 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.770
 Such a student factor is not yet any Cyprus 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.809
 then this is all they have until the first race 1 run 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 up actually here are two people to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.000
 party twig personal results from 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.570
 eight minutes and in of course the fence is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.659
 very high level it would all be in 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.939
 past years this year nobody even 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.420
 not close this border 8 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.909
 minutes see if they can 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.950
 guys that is something here to show here 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.479
 by the way 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.710
 the shoulders of the girls who passed in spirit 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.930
 also here how not brought super 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.939
 the results are wisely different from let's say 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.300
 the sum of the rest of the back who is there 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.300
 was female and male 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.360
 we'll see how here is the truth today 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.310
 runners on 1500 meters too let's say 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.880
 may not be the result 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.830
 pleased but the fight was beautiful 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 let's see how it ends well 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.630
 clear pacemaker ahead 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 hello yes i am here 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.979
 here are two shorty letters 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.380
 here is some lecture but no less 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.540
 decent situation at least they 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.360
 not very much running forward you can somehow rome 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 now on so here i listened to a cast if 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.750
 spread out like that the whole distance exactly on 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.380
 about a kilometer on the trail even if you run 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.830
 240 every kilometer and it will turn out like 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.980
 times eight minutes and 38 1 kilometer 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.400
 in fact, the pace is from 8 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.230
 minutes 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.450
 i.e. it is fast enough 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.220
 first see if i can save 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 option is unlikely they are so immediately here in 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.239
 anyway before the fact that the dead man west 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.239
 always these would like 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.140
 will they be able to maintain this pace 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.610
 as far as we remember the olympic final 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.040
 in general there was a disaster on stood by 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.750
 next friend 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.750
 ran in my last round there . 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.380
 so what happens at our high jump 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.840
 curiously just fell out of place where 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.190
 it is put above too but it is read 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.770
 that she is not a nipple in its place 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.600
 therefore should not have defended 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.080
 this is actually spelled out in 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.620
 the rules 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.630
 unequivocal therefore the judge was more 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.870
 just one watch out units 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.230
 the program all the floors prescribed 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.230
 rules 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.790
 629 floor has gone too 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.960
 stretched guys you there that pace 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.150
 really tall and traced everyones 2 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.650
 kilometer how much was but it seems to me 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.150
 that there is supported somewhere than 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.640
 sufficiently high level ie more 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.250
 less well worked the guys supported 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.760
 just this pace they did not fall behind like this 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.590
 usually it is therefore the last cool 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.660
 all seven closers track hair coloring 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.590
 then I merge the minute will jump out which is quite 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.660
 probably then at least 8 cm and 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.190
 further it seems to me may even get 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.250
 the role will be out of eight if now 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.680
 activated yes what are they actually 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.160
 must do at the finish 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.570
 All the more here too three well and 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.490
 considering that the circle is also shorter 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.160
 sandra you run out of because below 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.740
 cut off inside just stay up therefore 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.750
 it must be 400 meters 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.420
 you say always very important depends on 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.990
 moreover there is at-1 or no yes but there is wine 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.690
 that they hack fall by 3 to 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.550
 shoo hooked so want to win well 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.550
 let's shallow too sick for him 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.190
 need to run yes yes no all 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.479
 last order remains ah ah yes how 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.639
 I had to stop here 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.860
 overcoming but tough city competition 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.509
 blue record she is a little bit not one 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:14.660
 The record will not be much love 8:01 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:21.130
 1659 Moscow is already interesting on such 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.120
 they are so for 14 seconds well, here are the results 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.190
 boil here and personal records 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.190
 enough bektash quick get
