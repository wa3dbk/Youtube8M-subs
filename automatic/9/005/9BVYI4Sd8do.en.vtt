00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.650
 hello and welcome to the new video 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 Today I make an ice cream cake what that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.470
 exactly you see you are the same we need 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.710
 more 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.680
 we need ice and that was it 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.950
 I do not think so 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.809
 to the flour there is more with it already 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.360
 baking powder is added I had that 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.520
 unfortunately not and that's why I have two 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.760
 two teaspoons baking powder to flour to 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.580
 given and then blended to 1 it 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.680
 does not matter which one takes here 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.680
 simply vanilla ice cream or something else 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.690
 I 've converted car caramel ice cream here 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.040
 and then I add the flour 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.979
 What is also important in any case yet 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.780
 times that the ice is not tough from the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.900
 from the freezer comes but already 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.280
 something softened by thawing 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.560
 this is also the processing 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.110
 It will all be easier with one 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.790
 Mixing your hand mixer you can too 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.150
 a food processor in addition to whichever 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.950
 you have a beautiful one 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.060
 ice cold crowd 4 sees that is really 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.810
 Cold really cold and that was it 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.180
 actually already 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.399
 and the clou of the whole story is 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.310
 that is in this milk ice should not 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.439
 be that I forgot to mention 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.969
 already exist or are already 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.439
 ingredients in it to a dough 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.119
 finally, so are menig and fat 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.090
 Well, for example, they actually 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.200
 sometimes in 12 are found and the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.859
 is actually the ingredients then 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.600
 Also enough for a cream cake are in 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.009
 In the case you only need that with the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.469
 to give baking powder 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:09.280
 Stir in a baking pan as well 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:09.280
 here and then in the oven and bake 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.060
 it looks like that and then in the oven for 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:30.400
 Bake well for 45 minutes and so on 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.590
 looks so shortly after the baking process 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.450
 like a normal ordinary sponge cake 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.670
 just stop with a taste of pelÃ© 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 can and must caramel and ever 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 more interesting the ice-cream is all the more 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.590
 more interesting is the cake from 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.070
 taste 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.210
 so it looks cut and he looks like that 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.400
 was really delicious 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.650
 it is really something really great 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.970
 a very clever idea and the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.340
 You should try it if you are 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.420
 otherwise have a chance soon 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420
 and bye
