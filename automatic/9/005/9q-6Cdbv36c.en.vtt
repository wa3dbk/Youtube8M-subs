00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
use just because the single fire weapons
tend<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.199> put<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> at<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.859> bit<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.010> a

weapon shines is its range its range is
very<00:00:31.500> very<00:00:31.769> good<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.430> very<00:00:33.059> very

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
very very good and it's a very very

very very good and it's a very very
accurate<00:00:33.690> weapon<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.680> put<00:00:34.860> your

shots on target now

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740

one<00:00:37.800> recommendation<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.790> wouldn't<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.510> for

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
one recommendation I wouldn't have for

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.979 
one recommendation I wouldn't have for
you<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.070> don't<00:00:41.070> put<00:00:41.489> select<00:00:42.390> fire<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.840> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you is don't put select fire on this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600 
you is don't put select fire on this
weapon<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> people<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.100> rushing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
weapon a lot of people I see rushing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
weapon a lot of people I see rushing
around<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.969> select<00:00:45.270> fire<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
around with select fire on it and you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
around with select fire on it and you
know<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> bad<00:00:47.640> attachment<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.360> you're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
know it's not a bad attachment if you're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
know it's not a bad attachment if you're
gonna<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> enemy's<00:00:49.379> face<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.800> lot

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
gonna be up in the enemy's face a lot

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.729 
gonna be up in the enemy's face a lot
but<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> Select<00:00:52.110> fire<00:00:52.289> does<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
but what the Select fire does is

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
but what the Select fire does is
actually<00:00:52.920> reduce<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.670> range<00:00:53.969> by<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
actually reduce your range by about I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.220 
actually reduce your range by about I
think<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.260> well<00:00:55.379> 30%<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> lose<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
think is well 30% so you lose a lot of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.590 
think is well 30% so you lose a lot of
range<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.829> weapon<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.579> range<00:01:00.149> weapon

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
range and this weapon is a range weapon

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680 
range and this weapon is a range weapon
so<00:01:00.840> why<00:01:01.050> would<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.340> nerf<00:01:03.180> its

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so why would you you know nerf its

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.660 
so why would you you know nerf its
abilities<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.860> able<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> hit<00:01:05.220> people<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
abilities and be able to hit people at a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
abilities and be able to hit people at a
very<00:01:05.760> long<00:01:06.360> distance

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
very long distance

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.649 
very long distance
so<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:08.070> recommend<00:01:08.549> class<00:01:08.790> setup<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
so my recommend class setup for you is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
so my recommend class setup for you is
going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.220> screen<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:11.700> now

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
which is the FAL with the red dot sight

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.600 
which is the FAL with the red dot sight
stock<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> quick-draw<00:01:15.650> now<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> course<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
stock and quick-draw now of course you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.219 
stock and quick-draw now of course you
can<00:01:17.820> use<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> iron<00:01:18.360> sights<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
can use the iron sights on it if you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
can use the iron sights on it if you
wish<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> prefer<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.670> red<00:01:20.880> dot<00:01:21.060> sight<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
wish I prefer the red dot sight on this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.890 
wish I prefer the red dot sight on this
one

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
one

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.890 
one
just<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.850> performs<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
just because I think it just performs a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.210 
just because I think it just performs a
little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.200> better<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> red<00:01:25.740> dot<00:01:25.950> sight

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
little bit better with a red dot sight

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
little bit better with a red dot sight
and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> course<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.240> quick-draw<00:01:27.600> hand

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and then of course a quick-draw hand

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.030 
and then of course a quick-draw hand
will<00:01:28.020> allow<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> bring<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.619> sights<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
will allow you bring your sights up a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
will allow you bring your sights up a
little<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.340> faster<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.630> stock<00:01:30.869> will

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
little bit faster and the stock will

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
little bit faster and the stock will
allow<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> strafe<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.009> while

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
allow you to strafe around while

hardcore mode but in this one here I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
hardcore mode but in this one here I
find<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> very<00:01:47.250> very<00:01:47.790> effective<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
find it's a very very effective way to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.480 
find it's a very very effective way to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
kap-40 because the kap-40 does run out

of<00:01:54.960> ammo<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.740> fast<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:57.000> your

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of ammo very very fast and then your

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
with claymores because if you put them

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
with claymores because if you put them
into<00:02:01.979> choke<00:02:02.369> points<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.880> cut<00:02:03.090> off<00:02:03.180> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.310 
and VSAT now you will be amazed at how
high<00:03:29.340> your<00:03:29.610> score<00:03:29.880> per<00:03:30.060> minute<00:03:30.090> will<00:03:30.450> go<00:03:30.600> up<00:03:30.780> if

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
high your score per minute will go up if
