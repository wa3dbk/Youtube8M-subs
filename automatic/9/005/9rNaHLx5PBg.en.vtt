I don't want to just take my word for
how<00:00:03.030> good<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.300> platform<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:04.009> so<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> few<00:00:05.250> weeks

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
how good this platform is so a few weeks

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.930 
how good this platform is so a few weeks
ago<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:06.000> called<00:00:06.509> up<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.779> handful<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.170> companies

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
ago we called up a handful of companies

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.000 
ago we called up a handful of companies
and<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.030> asked<00:00:09.360> them<00:00:09.389> if<00:00:09.780> they<00:00:10.260> would<00:00:10.380> send<00:00:10.740> out

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
and we asked them if they would send out

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.140 
and we asked them if they would send out
a<00:00:11.340> couple<00:00:12.240> engineers<00:00:12.750> each<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.950> see<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:15.000> they

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
a couple engineers each to see what they

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.140 
a couple engineers each to see what they
could<00:00:15.210> accomplish<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.440> weeks<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:17.100> an<00:00:17.640> SDK

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
could accomplish in two weeks are an SDK

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.810 
could accomplish in two weeks are an SDK
that<00:00:18.630> they'd<00:00:18.810> never<00:00:19.020> seen<00:00:19.439> before<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.070> fact

that they'd never seen before in fact

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.470 
that they'd never seen before in fact
most<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.080> had<00:00:22.619> never<00:00:22.949> touched<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.550> Mac<00:00:23.850> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
most of them had never touched a Mac for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.019 
most of them had never touched a Mac for
development<00:00:24.990> before<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:26.490> did<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> what

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
development before and they did and what

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.070 
development before and they did and what
they<00:00:27.539> accomplished<00:00:28.140> blew<00:00:29.010> me<00:00:29.250> away<00:00:29.929> it's<00:00:30.929> just

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
they accomplished blew me away it's just

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.049 
they accomplished blew me away it's just
fantastic<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.099> instead<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.759> having<00:00:32.969> me

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

weeks we wanted to do something that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.780 
weeks we wanted to do something that
took<00:01:22.800> advantage<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.370> lot<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.670> different

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
took advantage of a lot of the different

described<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.980> so<00:01:32.250> again<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.940> we

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
described all of them so again that we

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.890 
described all of them so again that we
chose<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> game<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.870> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
chose is a game that we have a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
chose is a game that we have a
production<00:01:34.200> called<00:01:34.440> spore<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.730> idea<00:01:35.940> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
production called spore and the idea of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.760 
production called spore and the idea of
spores<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.780> taking<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.230> microorganism

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
spores it's about taking a microorganism

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
spores it's about taking a microorganism
from<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.490> primordial<00:01:39.090> soup<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.600> bottom

accelerometer<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.550> tilt<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.940> right<00:01:54.120> and<00:01:54.240> last

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
accelerometer to tilt it right and last

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
accelerometer to tilt it right and last
we<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.660> get<00:01:54.870> some<00:01:55.050> of<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.170> motion<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.620> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
we can get some of that motion that you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.460 
we can get some of that motion that you
saw<00:01:55.920> earlier<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> previous<00:01:56.580> demo<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
saw earlier in that previous demo the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.800 
saw earlier in that previous demo the
basic<00:01:59.010> goal<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.580> game<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.970> take<00:02:00.660> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
basic goal of the game is to take the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.390 
basic goal of the game is to take the
spore<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.229> eat<00:02:01.410> anything<00:02:01.620> smaller<00:02:02.040> than<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
spore and eat anything smaller than you

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.830 
spore and eat anything smaller than you
and<00:02:02.550> avoid<00:02:02.729> anything<00:02:03.000> larger<00:02:03.479> than<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:05.840> if

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and avoid anything larger than you if

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.790 
and avoid anything larger than you if
you<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.050> good<00:02:07.170> job<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.620> you're

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
you do a good job of that you're

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.380 
you do a good job of that you're
rewarded<00:02:08.220> by<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.700> call<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.940> evolution

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
rewarded by what we call the evolution

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.760 
rewarded by what we call the evolution
editor<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> evolution<00:02:10.080> editor<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.740> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
editor and the evolution editor is a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
editor and the evolution editor is a
great<00:02:11.040> place<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.490> us<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.760> take<00:02:12.000> advantage<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
great place for us to take advantage of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
great place for us to take advantage of
a<00:02:12.510> lot<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> touchscreen<00:02:13.230> capabilities<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a lot of the touchscreen capabilities of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.590 
a lot of the touchscreen capabilities of
this<00:02:14.070> device<00:02:14.400> we've<00:02:15.000> gone<00:02:15.150> from<00:02:15.270> sort<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
this device we've gone from sort of the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.940 
this device we've gone from sort of the
accelerometer<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:16.320> we're<00:02:16.470> playing<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
accelerometer now we're playing with the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.640 
accelerometer now we're playing with the
touch<00:02:17.570> what's<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:18.660> great<00:02:18.810> about<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:19.410> it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
touch what's so great about this is it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.110 
touch what's so great about this is it
allows<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.100> customize<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.730> game<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.000> two

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
allows you to customize the game in two

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.550 
allows you to customize the game in two
different<00:02:21.300> ways<00:02:21.510> first<00:02:21.959> we're<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
different ways first we're going to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.050 
different ways first we're going to
customize<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.100> gameplay<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.520> little<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
customize the gameplay a little bit so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.310 
customize the gameplay a little bit so
John's<00:02:24.330> going<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.570> go<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.930> using<00:02:25.230> his

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
John's going to go in here and using his

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.150 
John's going to go in here and using his
finger<00:02:25.530> he's<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.770> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.010> ahead<00:02:26.070> and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
finger he's just going to go ahead and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.340 
finger he's just going to go ahead and
touch<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.820> offensive<00:02:27.209> tract<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.870> he's<00:02:28.230> going

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
touch the offensive tract and he's going

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.810 
touch the offensive tract and he's going
to<00:02:28.410> add<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.800> pair<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.160> formidable-looking

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
to add in a pair of formidable-looking

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.449 
to add in a pair of formidable-looking
mandibles<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> front<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.019> our<00:02:31.110> sport

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
mandibles here on the front of our sport

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.920 
mandibles here on the front of our sport
so<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.550> see<00:02:32.670> those<00:02:32.820> appear<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.239> front<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
so you see those appear on the front the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.729 
so you see those appear on the front the
next<00:02:34.110> thing<00:02:34.170> we're<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> we're

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
next thing we're going to do is we're

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.660 
next thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> play<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.190> little<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
going to play with a little bit of a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.070 
going to play with a little bit of a
creative<00:02:36.090> personalization<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:36.989> this

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
creative personalization here on this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.660 
creative personalization here on this
part<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.530> more<00:02:37.860> about<00:02:38.010> making<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.370> sport

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
part is more about making this sport

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.920 
part is more about making this sport
look<00:02:38.820> cool<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.180> interesting<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.840> less

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
look cool and interesting and it's less

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.390 
look cool and interesting and it's less
to<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> gameplay<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:41.160> he's<00:02:41.280> going

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
to do with the gameplay but he's going

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.380 
to do with the gameplay but he's going
to<00:02:41.489> go<00:02:41.550> ahead<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.760> use<00:02:41.850> his<00:02:41.970> finger<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.330> just

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
to go ahead and use his finger and just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.640 
to go ahead and use his finger and just
start<00:02:42.630> moving<00:02:42.900> stuff<00:02:43.019> around<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.590> think

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
start moving stuff around so I think

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.960 
start moving stuff around so I think
he's<00:02:43.800> going<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> move<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> eyes<00:02:44.340> forward<00:02:44.730> here

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
he's going to move the eyes forward here

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.550 
he's going to move the eyes forward here
and<00:02:45.180> he's<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.630> touching<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.200> moving<00:02:46.230> these

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and he's just touching and moving these

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.199 
and he's just touching and moving these
forward<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.040> imagine<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.970> all<00:02:48.090> we've

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
forward so imagine this is all we've

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.550 
forward so imagine this is all we've
done<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.450> about<00:02:48.540> two<00:02:48.870> weeks<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.320> we<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.530> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
done in about two weeks but we have a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.810 
done in about two weeks but we have a
lot<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.800> time<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.220> could<00:02:50.340> imagine<00:02:50.550> us

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
lot of time you could imagine us

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.130 
lot of time you could imagine us
stretching<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.300> for<00:02:51.600> out<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.900> having

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
stretching this for out and having

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
stretching this for out and having
collars<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.830> really<00:02:53.280> making<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.550> like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
collars and really making this like

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
collars and really making this like
almost<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.390> play<00:02:54.630> area<00:02:54.780> two<00:02:55.170> people<00:02:55.410> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
almost like a play area two people to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.470 
almost like a play area two people to
personalize<00:02:56.130> their<00:02:56.340> spores<00:02:56.640> let's<00:02:57.269> go<00:02:57.360> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
personalize their spores let's go and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.460 
personalize their spores let's go and
bring<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.630> support<00:02:57.989> back<00:02:58.110> into<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> game

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
bring that support back into the game

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.020 
bring that support back into the game
now<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> little<00:03:01.490> about<00:03:01.610> development

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
now it's like a little about development

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.790 
now it's like a little about development
you<00:03:02.090> notice<00:03:02.270> we're<00:03:02.360> moving<00:03:02.570> from<00:03:02.720> level<00:03:02.990> 15<00:03:03.710> to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
you notice we're moving from level 15 to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.100 
you notice we're moving from level 15 to
level<00:03:04.010> 16<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.240> when<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:05.630> first<00:03:05.840> came<00:03:05.960> in<00:03:06.080> we

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
level 16 and when we first came in we

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.420 
level 16 and when we first came in we
sat<00:03:06.380> down<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.620> started<00:03:06.980> working<00:03:07.220> with<00:03:07.310> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
sat down and started working with the

sat down and started working with the
framework<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.940> took<00:03:08.060> us<00:03:08.120> about<00:03:08.330> two<00:03:08.390> days<00:03:08.780> to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
framework it took us about two days to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.870 
framework it took us about two days to
get<00:03:09.080> cocoa<00:03:09.440> touch<00:03:09.590> up<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.010> running<00:03:10.280> once<00:03:10.730> we

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
get cocoa touch up and running once we

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.070 
get cocoa touch up and running once we
have<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.030> up<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.330> running<00:03:11.630> we<00:03:11.900> were<00:03:11.960> then

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
have that up and running we were then

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.660 
have that up and running we were then

kinds of spores and experimenting with

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.010 
kinds of spores and experimenting with
what<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.300> thought<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.720> thought<00:03:26.780> might

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
accelerometer was so comfortably are

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.550 
accelerometer was so comfortably are
showing<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.600> bunch<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.840> Apple<00:03:33.140> employees

showing it to a bunch of Apple employees

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.680 
showing it to a bunch of Apple employees
so<00:03:33.980> they<00:03:34.070> could<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.370> sense<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.600> they

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
so they could get a sense of it and they

capability<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:39.230> we<00:03:39.290> threw<00:03:39.470> in<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.590> little

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
capability so we threw in a little

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.140 
capability so we threw in a little
cutscene<00:03:40.070> here<00:03:40.280> at<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.430> end<00:03:40.550> just<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:40.970> show
