00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
you strafe left in right rather than

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.190 
you strafe left in right rather than
naming<00:02:44.120> which<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> shame<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.840> game<00:02:46.020> that's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
