00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you do you have to change like when you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.049

move the player yourself like it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.479 
move the player yourself like it
teleports<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.079> person<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.620> player<00:00:34.890> into

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
teleports the person your player into

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
teleports the person your player into
the<00:00:35.610> air<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.719> actually<00:00:37.110> join<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the air but when you actually join the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
the air but when you actually join the
game<00:00:37.800> you'll<00:00:38.129> fall<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.610> death<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
game you'll fall to your death so it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.410 
game you'll fall to your death so it
would<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> best<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> over<00:00:40.440> water<00:00:41.420> ok

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
would be the best to do it over water ok

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.030 
would be the best to do it over water ok
so<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.660> download<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.440> whichever<00:00:43.710> time

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so you download it for whichever time

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
so you download it for whichever time
and<00:00:44.340> even<00:00:44.579> works<00:00:44.789> where<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> snapshot<00:00:45.539> 12<00:00:45.780> w<00:00:46.110> 0

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and even works where the snapshot 12 w 0

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.670 
and even works where the snapshot 12 w 0
8a<00:00:47.390> okay<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.450> once<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.840> download<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
8a okay so once you download that and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.240 
8a okay so once you download that and
run<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.870> do<00:00:51.870> run<00:00:54.710> I'm<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.039> put

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
currently I am

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.380 
currently I am
not<00:02:13.860> enough<00:02:14.250> slime<00:02:14.520> jokes<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.120> I'm<00:02:15.210> right

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
not enough slime jokes but I'm right

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.060 
not enough slime jokes but I'm right
next<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.810> many<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.230> take<00:02:19.440> pictures<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
next to many you can take pictures of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.300 
next to many you can take pictures of
these<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.970> captured<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.100> find

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
these with captured and you can find

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.710 
these with captured and you can find
nether<00:02:23.640> holds<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:25.640> don't<00:02:26.640> see<00:02:26.760> how<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.240> works

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
nether holds I don't see how that works

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.680 
nether holds I don't see how that works
but<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.340> that's<00:02:29.910> what<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.330> means<00:02:30.450> like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
but I I think that's what it means like

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.750 
but I I think that's what it means like
you<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:31.890> spot<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> make<00:02:32.430> another

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
you go to that one spot I make another

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.550 
you go to that one spot I make another
portal<00:02:33.270> right<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:33.660> that's<00:02:34.110> what<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.410> means

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
portal right there that's what it means

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560 
portal right there that's what it means
probably<00:02:37.160> I'm<00:02:38.160> probably<00:02:38.670> used<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> bunch<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
probably I'm probably used as a bunch of

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.420 
probably I'm probably used as a bunch of
times

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
times

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.510 
times
hopefully<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.910> series<00:02:42.270> anyways

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
hopefully not with this series anyways

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.130 
hopefully not with this series anyways
what<00:02:44.520> I'm<00:02:44.640> hoping<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.120> guys<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.900> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
what I'm hoping you guys like this and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.310 
what I'm hoping you guys like this and
if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.830> right<00:02:47.040> click<00:02:47.210> like<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.510> an<00:02:48.960> area<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
if you right click like to an area you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.680 
if you right click like to an area you
want<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.740> example<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.910> thing<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.540> move

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
want for example this thing you can move

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.050 
want for example this thing you can move
player<00:02:51.960> here<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:53.610> once<00:02:53.910> you're<00:02:54.030> done

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
player here and then once you're done

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.830 
player here and then once you're done
you<00:02:54.210> have<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.480> click<00:02:54.780> say<00:02:55.230> player<00:02:55.620> locations

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
you have to click say player locations

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.550 
you have to click say player locations
so<00:02:57.840> then<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.140> actually<00:02:58.410> works<00:03:00.200> but<00:03:01.200> anyways

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
so then it actually works but anyways

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.580 
so then it actually works but anyways
