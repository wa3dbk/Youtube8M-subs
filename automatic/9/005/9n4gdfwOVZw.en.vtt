single rubber band wrap it around your
hook<00:00:19.020> three<00:00:19.789> times<00:00:21.560> then<00:00:22.560> take<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:23.850> rubber

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
hook three times then take two rubber

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.970 
hook three times then take two rubber
bands<00:00:25.640> pull<00:00:26.640> them<00:00:26.849> tight<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.470> push<00:00:28.470> that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
bands pull them tight and push that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.810 
bands pull them tight and push that
tripled<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.820> band<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> center<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.820> then

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
tripled over band to the center and then

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.209 
tripled over band to the center and then
place<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.540> other<00:00:33.809> half<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> bands<00:00:34.950> back

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
place the other half of the bands back

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.490 
place the other half of the bands back
on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.550> hook<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.469> looks<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.710> this

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
on the hook so that it looks like this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
on the hook so that it looks like this
then<00:00:40.500> we're<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.890> add<00:00:41.100> two<00:00:41.520> more<00:00:41.550> rubber

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
then we're going to add two more rubber

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
then we're going to add two more rubber
bands<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.320> chain<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.800> there

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
bands to this chain so that you're there

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
bands to this chain so that you're there
and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:51.210> we're<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> slide<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.020> down

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and then we're going to slide this down

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
and then we're going to slide this down
our<00:00:52.440> hook<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.860> save<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.340> later<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.910> start

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
our hook to save for later and start

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.270 
our hook to save for later and start
another<00:00:54.809> chain<00:00:55.579> one<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:57.329> three<00:00:57.829> times<00:00:58.829> around

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
another chain one two three times around

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.020 
another chain one two three times around
with<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> single<00:01:00.000> band<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.820> at

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
with a single band and then take two at

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.700 
with a single band and then take two at
a<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:05.309> form<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.760> chain<00:01:08.990> your<00:01:09.990> hook<00:01:10.140> looks

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a time to form a chain your hook looks

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.429 
a time to form a chain your hook looks
like<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.280> now<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.729> hope<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.390> does<00:01:12.570> we're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
like this right now I hope it does we're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530 
like this right now I hope it does we're
gonna<00:01:13.590> add<00:01:13.860> eleven<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.670> pairs<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.330> rubber

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
gonna add eleven more pairs of rubber

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.140 
gonna add eleven more pairs of rubber
bands<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.650> chain<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.850> 12

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
bands to this chain so that there are 12

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
bands to this chain so that there are 12
total<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.860> number<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:21.680> here's<00:01:22.680> number

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
total so that's number one here's number

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.600 
total so that's number one here's number
two<00:01:23.900> we're<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.110> gonna<00:01:25.229> keep<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.740> adding<00:01:26.100> two

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
two we're just gonna keep on adding two

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.410 
two we're just gonna keep on adding two
at<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:27.030> until<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> chain<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.470> 12<00:01:29.420> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
at a time until we have a chain of 12 so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.560 
at a time until we have a chain of 12 so
that's<00:01:30.659> number<00:01:31.229> three<00:01:34.939> another<00:01:35.939> two<00:01:36.390> bands

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
that's number three another two bands

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.959 
that's number three another two bands
number<00:01:39.570> four

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:53.919 

two<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:46.579> makes<00:01:47.579> number<00:01:48.060> five

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:05.120 

two<00:01:54.929> more<00:01:56.299> for<00:01:57.299> number<00:01:57.719> six

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:19.000 

next<00:02:05.909> comes<00:02:06.350> seven<00:02:12.260> eight

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:37.410 

nine<00:02:21.340> three<00:02:22.340> more<00:02:24.519> that's<00:02:25.840> ten<00:02:33.700> eleven<00:02:34.700> and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:46.630 

twelve<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:44.629> your<00:02:45.170> hook<00:02:45.430> should<00:02:46.430> look<00:02:46.609> like

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
twelve so now your hook should look like

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.089 
twelve so now your hook should look like
that<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.870> first<00:02:48.079> one<00:02:48.290> with<00:02:48.409> a<00:02:48.439> chain<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.739> two

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
that the first one with a chain of two

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.069 
that the first one with a chain of two
and<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.459> second<00:02:49.849> one<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.659> a<00:02:50.689> chain<00:02:51.049> of

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
and the second one with a chain of

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.750 
and the second one with a chain of
twelve<00:02:52.359> we're<00:02:53.359> gonna<00:02:53.450> slide<00:02:53.810> those<00:02:54.109> both<00:02:54.440> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
twelve we're gonna slide those both and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.690 
twelve we're gonna slide those both and
create<00:02:55.760> one<00:02:56.180> more<00:02:56.480> chain<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.430> will<00:02:58.579> be

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
create one more chain this one will be

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.599 
create one more chain this one will be
smaller<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.139> we<00:03:00.170> wrap<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.709> around<00:03:00.950> three

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
smaller so we wrap that around three

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.349 
smaller so we wrap that around three
times<00:03:02.409> take<00:03:03.409> two<00:03:03.680> rubber<00:03:03.829> bands<00:03:05.530> pull<00:03:06.530> and

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
times take two rubber bands pull and

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.619 
times take two rubber bands pull and
push<00:03:08.359> over<00:03:09.079> that<00:03:09.230> tripled<00:03:09.620> over<00:03:09.859> band<00:03:10.629> bring

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
push over that tripled over band bring

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.300 
push over that tripled over band bring
it<00:03:11.750> back<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.139> your<00:03:12.319> hook<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.930> now<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.799> a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
it back on your hook so now you have a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.599 
it back on your hook so now you have a
chain<00:03:17.299> of<00:03:17.329> two<00:03:17.629> chain<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.409> twelve<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:19.459> a

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
chain of two chain of twelve and just a

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.390 
chain of two chain of twelve and just a
chain<00:03:19.849> of<00:03:19.879> one<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.720> we're<00:03:21.560> gonna<00:03:21.620> take<00:03:21.980> two

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
chain of one and we're gonna take two

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.319 
chain of one and we're gonna take two
more<00:03:22.670> rubber<00:03:22.730> bands<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:25.090> pull<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.299> through

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
more rubber bands and pull it through

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.349 
more rubber bands and pull it through
all<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:26.959> these<00:03:29.199> so<00:03:30.199> sliding<00:03:31.040> over<00:03:31.639> that<00:03:31.790> single

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
all of these so sliding over that single

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:32.890 
all of these so sliding over that single
one

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
one

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.800 
one
sliding<00:03:33.680> over<00:03:33.919> our<00:03:34.040> long<00:03:34.310> chain<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.000> then

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
sliding over our long chain and then

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.539 
sliding over our long chain and then
sliding<00:03:36.379> over<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:36.980> one<00:03:37.129> that<00:03:37.160> has<00:03:37.459> two<00:03:38.349> before

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
sliding over the one that has two before

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.379 
sliding over the one that has two before
putting<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:41.389> other<00:03:41.569> side<00:03:41.959> back<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.889> hook

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
putting the other side back on the hook

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.869 
putting the other side back on the hook
so<00:03:44.389> now<00:03:44.599> it<00:03:44.810> looks<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.139> this<00:03:45.699> and<00:03:46.699> that's

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
so now it looks like this and that's

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.809 
so now it looks like this and that's
going<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.389> be<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:50.120> part<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.690> queue<00:03:51.049> and

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
going to be that part of the queue and

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.309 
going to be that part of the queue and
this<00:03:52.819> is<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> curve<00:03:53.389> up<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.629> the<00:03:53.780> top<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
this is going to curve up to the top and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.610 
this is going to curve up to the top and
now<00:03:54.859> we're<00:03:55.040> going<00:03:55.129> to<00:03:55.220> make<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.430> chain<00:03:55.819> here

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
now we're going to make a chain here

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.699 
now we're going to make a chain here
with<00:03:57.620> eight<00:03:57.889> rubber<00:03:58.220> band<00:03:58.519> pairs<00:03:59.000> total<00:03:59.709> to

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
with eight rubber band pairs total to

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.009 
with eight rubber band pairs total to
connect<00:04:01.099> back<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.790> top<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.599> this<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.840> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
connect back to the top so this is the

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.309 
connect back to the top so this is the
first<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:05.569> taking<00:04:05.900> two<00:04:06.139> at<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.319> time

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
first so taking two at a time

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.880 
first so taking two at a time
adding<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.470> next

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:27.700 

another<00:04:16.890> two<00:04:19.220> for<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.340> third<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:26.450> fourth

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
another two for the third the fourth

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.310 
another two for the third the fourth
just<00:04:28.710> keep<00:04:28.950> going<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.760> more<00:04:30.030> pairs<00:04:30.450> of<00:04:30.810> bands

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
just keep going for more pairs of bands

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.680 
just keep going for more pairs of bands
trying<00:04:31.710> as<00:04:32.100> much<00:04:32.220> as<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.460> can<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:33.330> keep<00:04:33.480> them

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
trying as much as you can to keep them

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.220 
trying as much as you can to keep them
from<00:04:33.840> twisting<00:04:35.180> makes<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.360> result<00:04:36.690> look<00:04:36.960> a

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
from twisting makes the result look a

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:49.800 
from twisting makes the result look a
lot<00:04:37.530> neater<00:04:42.470> five

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.909 

six

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:12.399 

seven<00:05:00.699> and<00:05:03.400> eight<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.830> now<00:05:10.569> we<00:05:11.569> just<00:05:11.900> need<00:05:12.110> to

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
seven and eight so now we just need to

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.969 
seven and eight so now we just need to
connect<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:14.360> two<00:05:14.659> sides<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.439> the<00:05:15.710> queue

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
connect the two sides of the queue

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.999 
connect the two sides of the queue
together<00:05:16.370> so<00:05:16.729> we're<00:05:16.909> going<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.830> leave<00:05:18.830> this

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
together so we're going to leave this

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.010 
together so we're going to leave this
flat<00:05:19.400> just<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:19.879> make<00:05:20.060> sure<00:05:20.270> you<00:05:20.509> don't<00:05:20.629> twist

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
flat just to make sure you don't twist

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.920 
flat just to make sure you don't twist
it<00:05:21.699> you<00:05:22.699> see<00:05:22.879> how<00:05:22.999> those<00:05:23.180> are<00:05:23.300> all<00:05:23.449> lined<00:05:23.749> up

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
it you see how those are all lined up

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.420 
it you see how those are all lined up
and<00:05:24.469> then<00:05:24.860> bring<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.340> flat<00:05:25.999> on<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.330> table<00:05:27.430> to

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
and then bring it flat on the table to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.850 
and then bring it flat on the table to
put<00:05:28.639> your<00:05:28.819> hook<00:05:29.060> through<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:30.289> results<00:05:30.620> will

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
put your hook through the results will

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.839 
put your hook through the results will
look<00:05:31.009> a<00:05:31.099> lot<00:05:31.310> better<00:05:31.599> if<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:33.409> haven't<00:05:33.919> flipped

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
look a lot better if you haven't flipped

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.390 
look a lot better if you haven't flipped
that<00:05:35.210> over<00:05:35.629> so<00:05:36.169> once<00:05:36.349> it<00:05:36.500> looks<00:05:36.710> like<00:05:36.949> that<00:05:37.129> and

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
that over so once it looks like that and

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.909 
that over so once it looks like that and
you<00:05:37.490> have<00:05:37.759> your<00:05:38.419> hook<00:05:38.719> through<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.379> cap<00:05:39.620> band

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
you have your hook through the cap band

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.580 
you have your hook through the cap band
and<00:05:40.250> through<00:05:41.000> these<00:05:41.180> two<00:05:41.509> we're<00:05:42.319> just<00:05:42.469> gonna

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
and through these two we're just gonna

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.980 
and through these two we're just gonna
take<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.860> single<00:05:43.490> rubber<00:05:43.669> band<00:05:45.729> and<00:05:46.750> pull<00:05:47.750> it

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
take a single rubber band and pull it

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.579 
take a single rubber band and pull it
through<00:05:48.020> all<00:05:48.889> of<00:05:49.159> those<00:05:49.550> loops<00:05:50.589> before

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.589 
through all of those loops before

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.260 
through all of those loops before
returning<00:05:52.129> the<00:05:52.279> rubber<00:05:52.490> band<00:05:52.699> back<00:05:52.939> on<00:05:53.000> the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
returning the rubber band back on the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.779 
returning the rubber band back on the
hook<00:05:53.449> and<00:05:53.870> now<00:05:54.680> we're<00:05:54.860> going<00:05:54.949> to<00:05:55.009> create<00:05:55.490> a

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
hook and now we're going to create a

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.629 
hook and now we're going to create a
slip<00:05:56.210> knot<00:05:56.240> by<00:05:56.779> pulling<00:05:57.259> this<00:05:57.589> side<00:05:58.039> of<00:05:58.520> the

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
slip knot by pulling this side of the

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.519 
slip knot by pulling this side of the
rubber<00:05:58.819> band<00:05:59.120> through<00:05:59.810> the<00:06:00.050> middle<00:06:00.289> of<00:06:00.379> this

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
rubber band through the middle of this

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:07.480 
rubber band through the middle of this
side<00:06:03.759> like<00:06:04.759> that<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:06.169> you<00:06:06.379> pull<00:06:06.560> it<00:06:06.589> tight<00:06:06.919> and

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
side like that and you pull it tight and

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.709 
side like that and you pull it tight and
then<00:06:08.139> you<00:06:09.139> have<00:06:09.439> your<00:06:09.740> very<00:06:10.099> own<00:06:10.330> cue<00:06:11.330> charm
