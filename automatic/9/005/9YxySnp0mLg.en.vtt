because<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:06.670> all<00:03:06.760> about<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.000> campaign<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.540> we

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
because it's all about a campaign so we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.120 
because it's all about a campaign so we
don't<00:03:07.780> throw<00:03:07.989> money<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.440> first<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.010> then

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
don't throw money in it first and then

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.759 
don't throw money in it first and then
we<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:10.300> know<00:03:10.390> generate<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.410> money<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
we can you know generate the money and

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.890 
we can you know generate the money and
all<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:11.860> afterwards<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.480> safer

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
all that afterwards so it's just a safer

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.509 
all that afterwards so it's just a safer
route<00:03:14.110> for<00:03:14.410> people<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.769> go<00:03:14.890> who<00:03:15.100> want<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> make

it's a I think it's a fairly small city

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.750 
it's a I think it's a fairly small city
compared<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.170> city's<00:05:32.410> next<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.800> us<00:05:32.950> just
