strength and conditioning in Chico each

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.230 
strength and conditioning in Chico each
one<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.349> those<00:00:28.470> folks<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> sphere<00:00:30.210> of

one of those folks has a sphere of
influence<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.650> influencing<00:00:32.430> tens

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
influence and so we're influencing tens

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.400 
influence and so we're influencing tens
of<00:00:33.210> thousands<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> people<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.200> our<00:00:34.260> local

community<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.390> stuff<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> we

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
community and the the stuff that we

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.830 
community and the the stuff that we
bring<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.329> deeply

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
bring about we we are just deeply

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
bring about we we are just deeply
steeped<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.440> idea<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> ancestral<00:00:41.430> health

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
steeped in this idea of ancestral health

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.389 
steeped in this idea of ancestral health
and<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.210> every<00:00:42.960> time<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.129> on-ramp

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and so every time we have an on-ramp

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
and so every time we have an on-ramp
class<00:00:44.730> every<00:00:45.149> time<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> new<00:00:45.809> personal

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
class every time we have a new personal

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.200 
class every time we have a new personal

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
training client we have an opportunity

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.479 
training client we have an opportunity
to<00:00:48.360> talk<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> people<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:49.140> why<00:00:49.890> sleep<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
may be problematic for body composition

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
may be problematic for body composition
issues<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> also<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.960> overall<00:01:01.230> health

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320

to the degree that we can get this idea
of<00:03:38.470> ancestral<00:03:39.010> wellness<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.670> ancestral

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
of ancestral wellness and ancestral

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.750 
of ancestral wellness and ancestral
fitness<00:03:40.570> into<00:03:41.500> gyms<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.070> fitness<00:03:42.130> centers

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
fitness into gyms and fitness centers

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.789 
fitness into gyms and fitness centers
the<00:03:43.209> next<00:03:43.570> extension<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.320> talking<00:03:44.709> about

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
the next extension is talking about

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.520 
the next extension is talking about
grass-fed<00:03:45.430> meat<00:03:45.670> wild<00:03:46.090> caught<00:03:46.269> fish<00:03:46.530> local

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
grass-fed meat wild caught fish local

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.949 
grass-fed meat wild caught fish local
sustainable<00:03:48.130> produce<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.420> stuff<00:03:49.630> like<00:03:49.780> that

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
sustainable produce and stuff like that

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.900 
sustainable produce and stuff like that
so<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.860> real<00:03:51.220> opportunity<00:03:51.610> to

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
so this is a real opportunity to

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.000 
so this is a real opportunity to
catalyze<00:03:52.420> change<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.829> most

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
catalyze change but one of the most

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.400 
catalyze change but one of the most
critical<00:03:54.459> things<00:03:54.730> for<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.299> gym<00:03:55.660> owner<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.260> to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
critical things for that gym owner is to

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.259 
critical things for that gym owner is to
keep<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> lights<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.790> bills<00:03:57.970> paid

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
keep the lights on and the bills paid

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.000 
keep the lights on and the bills paid
because<00:03:58.780> i<00:03:58.959> see<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.170> lot<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.410> gyms<00:03:59.739> that<00:03:59.829> are

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
because i see a lot of gyms that are

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.860 
because i see a lot of gyms that are
really<00:04:00.280> poorly<00:04:00.610> run<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.000> they<00:04:01.090> either<00:04:01.510> fail

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
really poorly run and they either fail

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.039 
really poorly run and they either fail
or<00:04:01.900> they<00:04:02.320> barely<00:04:02.650> scrape<00:04:03.280> by<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.570> so<00:04:04.930> what

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
or they barely scrape by and and so what

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.849 
or they barely scrape by and and so what
i'm<00:04:05.140> going<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.350> talk<00:04:05.470> about<00:04:05.530> are<00:04:05.829> some

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
i'm going to talk about are some

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.479 
i'm going to talk about are some
strategies<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:07.630> be<00:04:08.560> able<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.799> thrive<00:04:09.190> in

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
strategies to to be able to thrive in
