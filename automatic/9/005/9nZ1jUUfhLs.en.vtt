00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.589
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.149
 welcome to a new video and in this 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:09.879
 occasion I bring you this bar 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.670
 notifications which I took from the rom 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:16.270
 ex droid ok this one would be like his 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.820
 king or as his patch ok down here in the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.070
 description of the video I will leave the link 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.260
 download and the video link of how 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.170
 install it the link is his 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.240
 creator that is sergio magaña les 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.920
 I recommend that apart from watching the video 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.770
 how to install it , give yourself a turn 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.570
 for its channel since it brings some 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.970
 very interesting things and good following 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.830
 with the video because this is the bar 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.809
 notifications ok 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.120
 apparently it looks very simple but it is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.670
 very customizable for example if I 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.129
 I give here where it says advanced is going to us 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.030
 show this menu and where it says widget 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.190
 buttons I will be able to add tools to 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.949
 this curtain of notifications by 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.470
 example, I'll give it where it says 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.809
 settings and where it says reset apps ok a 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.120
 once giving this under my curtain and as 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.870
 can be seen added in cs tings and 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.850
 networks in apps ok good another good 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.670
 advantage that this has is that we can 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.979
 put two photos this something like what 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.750
 of the profile of facebook and good as 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.690
 let's do this for example here says 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.729
 we settings here where I'm checking 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.850
 on the right side is this icon what 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.920
 let's select and we will give it 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.470
 where it says status bar 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.960
 and for example here gives us to put 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.909
 the color that we want as they 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.520
 I comment then it is very customizable 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.720
 ok here you can see that it is red 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.659
 The top 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.479
 ok and for example if I give it big of 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.030
 panel notification equally what is 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.670
 I will be able to change the color to the bar 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.530
 that I want and in the part below 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.810
 where you are pressing then we are going to 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.670
 to be able to select what would be the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.979
 transparency for example if I what 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.750
 I want very transparent I leave it like this and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.190
 it is practically transparent 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.409
 but you do not see much 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.049
 equally well, this is a matter of 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.060
 you play with that transparency and 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.180
 for example of that being will give 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.069
 there we select and here it says 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.620
 normal player 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.890
 efe style for example if I give it in 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.390
 normal is removed this we had as 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.110
 From Facebook 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.050
 and likewise if I put fp style 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 Well, it will be ok again to put 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.740
 an image there we have the option to go to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.959
 where to go are beltrán if the law of 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.319
 sorry and here for example let's give 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.200
 where sam bell says 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.499
 colette picture and there we select them 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.620
 and he's going to send us to our gallery to 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:52.189
 that we can choose some 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.379
 image here and good then in this case 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.019
 so that I did not take long I'm going to 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.909
 select any randomly by 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.090
 example let's select that and you 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.209
 we give where it says ok and automatically 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.760
 this photo will already be a profile picture 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.630
 to change it to another photo let's go 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.790
 simply to configuration 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.780
 and once in configuration we're going to 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.990
 give them timeline picture and we will give 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.150
 where sainz time timeline picture and there 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.670
 we select and in the same way 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.310
 we are going to select the form of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.310
 change for example I 'm going to give this 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.700
 and for example here you can put some 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.760
 text and they already select it 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.489
 and we left the configuration and here 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.540
 As you can see, we already have both 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:51.730
 photos that is the profile and it would come 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.519
 being this other that I'm playing 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.140
 what else do you have and in the same way 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.670
 we can add it all we can 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.349
 block it from here for example to 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.510
 who of lockdown this I'm 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.610

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.820
 lock my screen 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.170
 ok this will help us to give more 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.800
 life to what is our button 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.600
 lock on or on of equal 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.079
 way in the Togolese itself it has 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.630
 the option of the reboot that is to restart 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.880
 or turn it off as you wish it brings very 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.850
 good options the brightness for example in 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.620

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.050

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.470
 change and it shows us the option to 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.930
 change 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.270
