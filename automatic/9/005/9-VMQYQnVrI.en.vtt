00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 so this is the fourth video on the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.629
 best fat 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.629
 food 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.160
 you've seen the first video that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.080
 the lipids are essential to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.769
 our operation of our 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 organization 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 in the second and different points of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730
 view and argues the amount sheets 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.439
 agreement could in its supply 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.609
 for different currents 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.230
 raw food in the third video 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.820
 how I evolved myself I you 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.369
 given my opinion and my advice 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.740
 concrete to adapt amount of fat to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 your personal case and we will see 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 today what are the differences 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.879
 of nutritional contributions between all these 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 oleaginous plants free so I did 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.329
 always favors whole plant 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 as always so I do not speak 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.110
 oils so it's easier 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 adapt I find these amounts wept 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 in his food when you know what 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 it contains 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 So here the plants contain no 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 cholesterol 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.550
 we do not need to eat or 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.140
 trans fatty acids are acids 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.239
 polyunsaturated fatty transform 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.680
 industrially the plants 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.270
 mainly contain fatty acids 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.540
 saturated and mono fatty acid 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 and polyunsaturated fats 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.390
 saturated it is greece that is solid to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 room temperature this is partly the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 layer of fat that is under the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.439
 skin it causes an increase in 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.360
 cholesterol levels and blocking 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.159
 arteries 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.210
 it takes a little bit of blemmi amara us 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.759
 helps many plants in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.500
 contain small quantities 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.119
 Other types of lipids that are 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.909
 Beneficial fatty acids are mono 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.640
 unsaturated and polyunsaturated fulfilled dre 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.659
 mono unsaturated there is a double bond 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.700
 between the carbon atoms 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.890
 in short, we find it mainly in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.439
 avocados olives and oleaginous 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.259
 and it is the acid and of mÃ©gane 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.420
 oleic polyunsaturated fats 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.189
 Secret essential fatty acids 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.130
 reduce the risk of disease 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.350
 cardiovascular alzheimer's disease 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.299
 it would protect certain cancers 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.399
 especially the prostate 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.280
 it improves the mood they are good at 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.350
 our brain and the nervous system to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 cellular morals and it's these are the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.330
 essential fatty acids and it includes 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.450
 the omega-6s in the precursor and the sib 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.840
 linoleic and then omega-3 with 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.000
 alpha-linolenic acid then from 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.400
 of these two fatty acids organize it 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.980
 the body forms other fatty acids 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.019
 essential from the same family 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 The balance between these 2 wherein there are 6 omega 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.510
 3 was changed during the century 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.060
 last he went from 1 1 to 1 10 to 10 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.260
 even 20 to 1 because of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.610
 industrial food so 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.680
 ideally this should be respected 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.459
 balance not too far from 1: 1 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.980
 or 4 to 1 as much as possible that more 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.010
 ratio, the higher the risk 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 inflammatory mouth and is great 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.090
 to is a news vegan one 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.069
 quickly improves this ratio since 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.540
 the limits ready made products and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.549
 to eat fruit and vegetables 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.829
 plants whole and that can not be found 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.920
 food so we avoid animating the 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.410
 essential fatty acids keep them 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.359
 intact then I made you a painting 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.639
 to explain you from the data 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.120
 of the book vi as heroes and that of 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:18.500
 g where we see that the best sources 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.340
 unsaturated poly or omega 3 and 6 and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.769
 nuts and seeds the fatty fruits 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.230
 avocado olive and coconut it brings 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.930
 saturated fats and fatty acids 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.890
 monounsaturated 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.719
 Omega 9 but you see noah or 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.760
 fruit it does not hold that only one kind 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.290
 fat that people ignore good 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 often it is a food that is 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.450
 extremely complete it is complex and it 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.250
 does not boil down to this component not in one 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.900
 sees hemp seed and 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.459
 walnuts contain 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.500
 relatively large amounts of 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.719
 two components 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.760
 if everyone knows that or pretty much 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.799
 Finally, as for example linseed 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.439
 contain two mega 3 that coop fashion 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.150
 where it contains saturated fat than 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.919
 pumpkin seeds that's all omegas 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.859
 6 fights we see that it also brings 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:11.019
 other fatty acids in lesser quantities 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.609
 so I hope you'll have fun 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.319
 watch this table to discover 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.049
 maybe the percentages of checks 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.680
 fatty acids in these plants then 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.900
 they are still 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.099
 reminder that if one eats 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.380
 fruit vegetables and leaves 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.020
 green we already absorb 5 to 7% greece 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.160
 it's tempting but it's true that if 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.090
 months is added and seeds is 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.210
 fine but it's not a 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.400
 acidifying is that it eats bones and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.889
 teeth and unconvincing not commit 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.479
 over and again good 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.870
 attitude is to eat sensibly 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.370
 raw plants mainly 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.010
 Plant increased primarily look 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.580
 in the evening sauces just you 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.400
 now know what they are 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.260
 and composed of these foods you 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270
 find this table if it you 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.580
 interested in the blog under the video 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.680
 then a final reminder the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.690
 optimal amount of absorbed fat 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.509
 depend from each according to the poll 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.190
 his state of health his metabolism that 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.860
 can go from 5 to 7 so with that 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.169
 bananas up to 35% for certain that 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.060
 of ivory where the bar of 10% maximum 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.409
 being the one advocated by 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.669
 gram and beyond 35 % the problems 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.500
 may appear 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.530
 sometimes the point of view of health or 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.380
 Waist circumference is also recalled that 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.300
 Keep in mind two things the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.820
 One is that most of 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.650
 those calories should come from fruits in 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.660
 as a simple sugar and the second 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.460
 is that the sugar 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.290
 gr competes in the direction and 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.180
 causes regulatory problems in 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.450
 while both blood and so do 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.960
 not mix nuts and fruit 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.570
 yet it also it should be taken 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.340
 reasonably and not being 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.980
 stressed that is a small 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.410
 spoon of almond with a large 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.300
 basic apple lady package has not been 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.330
 no more dramatic just see 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.280
 again there is the theory on and 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.130
 38 years old she must talk about it then 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.240
 adaptation 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.920
 I hope all of this interested you 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.870
 leave your comments below 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.220
 as usual and I tell you 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.220
 soon for another subject
