00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
just running around and since they're so

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.299 
just running around and since they're so
slow<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.719> can't<00:00:36.899> even<00:00:37.050> catch<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.500> him<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
slow they can't even catch up to him so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.450 
slow they can't even catch up to him so
what's<00:00:39.030> happening<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:43.160> would<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> say

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
what's happening is I would have to say

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.360 
what's happening is I would have to say
I<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.239> 50<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:46.620> paper<00:00:46.800> Zeppelin's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I have about 50 little paper Zeppelin's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.799 
I have about 50 little paper Zeppelin's
clogging<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.480> screen<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.620> follow<00:00:49.860> me

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
clogging up my screen as they follow me

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.910 
clogging up my screen as they follow me
see<00:00:51.809> ya<00:00:52.020> probably<00:00:52.469> speed<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.600> because

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
see ya probably speed them up because

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.020 
see ya probably speed them up because
this<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.100> probably<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> rare<00:00:56.760> occurrence

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this will probably be a rare occurrence

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.160 
this will probably be a rare occurrence
but<00:00:57.480> no<00:00:58.100> big<00:00:59.100> quite<00:00:59.399> annoying<00:00:59.699> if<00:01:00.690> you've<00:01:00.989> just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
but no big quite annoying if you've just

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
but no big quite annoying if you've just
been<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.530> throwing<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.489> forth

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
been like throwing them back and forth

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.399 
been like throwing them back and forth
with<00:01:02.820> people<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.359> me<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.719> friend<00:01:03.960> oh<00:01:04.080> yeah

with people like me my friend oh yeah
you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.799> probably<00:01:05.309> grieve<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:06.090> well

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
with this but right now he's at about

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.620 
with this but right now he's at about
like<00:01:11.610> 11<00:01:12.540> papers<00:01:12.930> upwards<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> what's<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
like 11 papers upwards so what's just

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
like 11 papers upwards so what's just
happening<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.860> also<00:01:17.009> work

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
happening you this it can also work

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
happening you this it can also work
double<00:01:17.549> ways<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.210> start<00:01:18.270> moving<00:01:18.750> around

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
double ways so if I start moving around

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.090 
double ways so if I start moving around
like<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.450 

and<00:01:23.220> after<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:24.650> Zeppelin's<00:01:25.650> chasing<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.280> for

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and after our Zeppelin's chasing out for

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.050 
and after our Zeppelin's chasing out for
me<00:01:27.530> say<00:01:28.530> hi<00:01:28.830> guys<00:01:29.130> upland<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.670> there's<00:01:29.820> still

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
