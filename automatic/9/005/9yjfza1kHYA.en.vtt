white<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.780> rely<00:01:43.080> upon<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:44.430> he's<00:01:45.300> very<00:01:46.110> very

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
white can rely upon so he's very very

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.190 
white can rely upon so he's very very
strong<00:01:46.890> piece<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.870> could<00:01:49.020> easily

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
strong piece and that could easily

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.550 
strong piece and that could easily
compensate<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.870> one<00:01:51.870> side<00:01:52.110> having<00:01:52.440> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
compensate for one side having the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
compensate for one side having the
bishop<00:01:52.860> pair<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.370> knight<00:01:53.760> versus<00:01:54.240> bishop

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
bishop pair or a knight versus bishop

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.320 
bishop pair or a knight versus bishop
situation<00:01:55.400> so<00:01:56.400> after<00:01:56.700> Bishop<00:01:56.850> takes<00:01:57.030> Knight

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
situation so after Bishop takes Knight

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.640 
situation so after Bishop takes Knight
we<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.870> F<00:01:58.590> takes<00:01:59.220> G<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.990> opened<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.500> an

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
we have F takes G and this opened up an

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.490 
we have F takes G and this opened up an
interesting<00:02:01.950> possibility<00:02:02.370> for<00:02:03.090> white<00:02:03.500> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
interesting possibility for white and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.289 
interesting possibility for white and
it's<00:02:04.770> one<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> white<00:02:05.370> didn't<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.850> forward

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
it's one that white didn't go forward

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.249 
it's one that white didn't go forward
with<00:02:06.450> namely<00:02:07.440> Knight<00:02:07.680> b5<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.720> game<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.049> saw

Bishop<00:02:10.679> takes<00:02:10.890> Knight<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.580> after<00:02:12.030> Knight<00:02:12.240> b5

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
Bishop takes Knight but after Knight b5

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.590 
Bishop takes Knight but after Knight b5

this Fork for one thing the knight could

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
this Fork for one thing the knight could
clearly<00:02:18.150> be<00:02:18.270> taken<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:18.930> notice<00:02:19.320> what<00:02:19.530> new

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
but actually not just yet order is very

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.540 
but actually not just yet order is very
important<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.470> case<00:02:28.710> if<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.100> take<00:02:29.310> right

could be defended but still an

could be defended but still an
interesting<00:02:59.489> position<00:02:59.870> evaluation<00:03:00.870> as<00:03:01.020> you

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
interesting position evaluation as you

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.479 
interesting position evaluation as you
can<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.770> hand<00:03:01.950> side<00:03:02.250> is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
can see on the right hand side is

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.150 
can see on the right hand side is
reading<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.030> White<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.900> still<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.410> little<00:03:04.950> bit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
reading that White is still a little bit

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.690 
reading that White is still a little bit
better<00:03:05.310> here<00:03:05.730> by<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:05.910> point

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
better here by a point

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.370 
better here by a point
interesting<00:03:08.700> continuation<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.750> that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
interesting continuation and that's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.460 
interesting continuation and that's
something<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.040> was<00:03:11.900> not<00:03:12.900> something<00:03:13.140> white

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
something that was not something white

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.260 
something that was not something white
went<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:13.920> maybe<00:03:14.160> white<00:03:14.430> simply<00:03:14.850> didn't<00:03:15.090> see

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
went for maybe white simply didn't see

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.440 
went for maybe white simply didn't see
it<00:03:15.420> or<00:03:15.570> maybe<00:03:15.840> assess<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.440> position<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.450> you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
it or maybe assess this position is you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.310 
it or maybe assess this position is you
know<00:03:18.540> not<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.110> white<00:03:19.350> really<00:03:19.590> liked<00:03:19.920> so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
know not one that white really liked so

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.090 
know not one that white really liked so
just<00:03:22.320> coming<00:03:22.530> back<00:03:22.680> here<00:03:23.040> instead<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:25.100> instead

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just coming back here instead of instead

this<00:04:34.050> was<00:04:34.259> an<00:04:34.380> interesting<00:04:34.530> move<00:04:35.009> looking<00:04:35.400> to

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
this was an interesting move looking to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.180 
this was an interesting move looking to
it<00:04:35.850> my<00:04:36.479> first<00:04:36.750> thought<00:04:36.960> when<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.169> see<00:04:37.410> a5<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.860> to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
it my first thought when I see a5 is to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.999 
it my first thought when I see a5 is to
clamp<00:04:38.430> down<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:38.729> this<00:04:39.030> structure<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.770> know<00:04:40.889> is

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
clamp down on this structure you know is

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.189 
clamp down on this structure you know is
to<00:04:41.130> stop<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.520> bee<00:04:41.669> from<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.539> b-pawn<00:04:42.900> from

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
to stop the bee from the b-pawn from

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.640 
to stop the bee from the b-pawn from
maybe<00:04:43.410> moving<00:04:43.740> but<00:04:44.120> there's<00:04:45.120> an<00:04:45.240> additional

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
maybe moving but there's an additional

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.430 
maybe moving but there's an additional
reason<00:04:46.650> behind<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:47.130> as<00:04:47.220> we'll<00:04:47.400> see<00:04:47.900> Queen<00:04:48.900> a6

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
reason behind it as we'll see Queen a6

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.939 
reason behind it as we'll see Queen a6
the<00:04:49.979> Queen<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.370> there<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.729> maybe<00:04:50.970> enter<00:04:51.419> on<00:04:51.949> d3

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
takes Knight Queen takes bishop so I

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.770 
takes Knight Queen takes bishop so I
really<00:06:24.389> can't<00:06:24.570> push<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.650> envelope<00:06:26.009> too<00:06:26.220> much

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
really can't push the envelope too much

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.689 
really can't push the envelope too much
so<00:06:27.780> I<00:06:28.229> guess<00:06:28.830> that's<00:06:29.039> a<00:06:29.159> reasonable<00:06:29.550> result

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
so I guess that's a reasonable result

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.589 
so I guess that's a reasonable result
both<00:06:30.150> players<00:06:30.770> just<00:06:31.770> agreeing<00:06:32.729> to<00:06:32.940> a<00:06:32.970> drop<00:06:33.330> at

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
both players just agreeing to a drop at

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:34.270 
both players just agreeing to a drop at
this<00:06:33.840> point

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
this point

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.280 
this point
so<00:06:35.280> that's<00:06:36.240> all<00:06:36.390> for<00:06:36.540> this<00:06:36.660> video<00:06:36.840> feel<00:06:37.260> free
