00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 Well, no 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.070
 good guys as you can see I can not 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.689
 talk so I'm going to record the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.160
 introduction we are going to make this effect 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.869
 let's do it in two steps first I'll 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.210
 to cover the mouth and then we will create 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.529
 this slit effect adhered so if 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.270
 you want to see how we do it we are 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.340
 seeing 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.900
 [Music] 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.370
 make the effect of the mouth covered for 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.320
 this I'm going to use carpenter's tape that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 it's paper cut with your fingers and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.720
 also latex I'm going to apply three tapes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.640
 vertically that they will cover all 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.100
 the area of ​​the lips and I'm going to apply 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 several layers of latex I will be applying 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 one layer leaving it to dry by applying another 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.730
 so until I get between 3 and 4 layers 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.340
 you can help with a hairdryer in the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.379
 setting of cold air and once we have 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.269
 these several layers applied we are going to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.040
 make a layer of paper to apply 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.020
 just a layer of latex that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 I will apply the paper on top and then another 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.920
 latex layer on top of the paper and once 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.049
 I will not get everything out again 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.049
 [Applause] 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.619
 [Music] 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.619
 [Applause] 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920
 to 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.310
 in the last two layers of latex 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.590
 make sure to blur the edge of the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.540
 latex towards our skin and I'm going to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.220
 do this time with your fingers to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.570
 that you can see that latex can be used 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.010
 with your fingers you do not need any type 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.080
 of tool and this also helps us 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.510
 to create a much more real integration 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.800
 once we have everything completely dry 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.930
 what I will do is going to be started 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.670
 inform all the skin tone with 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.860
 this area of ​​latex for that I'm going to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.510
 use a makeup base on stick 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.160
 that has a lot more coverage and I'm going to 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.090
 apply the taps to create even 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:06.879
 greater coverage 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.879
 [Music] 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.240
 [Applause] 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.710
 we already have the effect of itself would already be 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.360
 this a pretty striking effect for 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.860
 any type of makeup but I'm going to 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.080
 take a little bit further and I'm going to do 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.910
 a slit effect instead of a mouth 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.950
 that I'm going to use on the silicone comes 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.080
 normally in three compounds the bird and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.570
 What Cayb does is create the effect 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.990
 of silicone and faith what it does is 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.390
 be able to change the density of 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.000
 silicones that I'm going to mix to ive for 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.410
 create a mass to your site I advise that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.940
 go little by little because these masses are 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.430
 dry very easily and creates a 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.170
 little bit applies it creates more until 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.540
 get all the effect that we are 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.180
 doing first is to create a kind of 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.040
 guide with a beige pencil where will the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.920
 slit and now I'm applying little by little 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.870
 it's silicone on one of the edges of this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.670
 guide that I created what I'm going to do is 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.030
 the part that integrates to the face 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.970
 I'm going to clean the spatula and blur what 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.160
 more that I can withdraw and make a 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 much more integrated finish and the area 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.240
 that is going to hit the wound that is the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.090
 part towards the center what I'm going to do 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.950
 is to create upward movements in this 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.220
 area of ​​the silicone to create an effect 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.330
 much more 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.330
 dramatic cut 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:27.670
 [Applause] 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:29.190
 [Music] 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:42.110
 [Applause] 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:45.269
 [Music] 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.269
 [Applause] 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.819
 [Music] 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.500
 once the silicone is completely 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.050
 dry let's remove the shine that has 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.460
 sealing some translucent powders 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.770
 loose and the next thing he's going to do is 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.270
 to be a report the color of porsche 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.980
 this silicone does not have too much color and 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.930
 it's quite natural but I'm going to create 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.330
 a uniformity applying the same basis 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.830
 I applied to stay around the area 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.640
 latex before you start creating the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.640
 color effects 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.090
 for the color effects I will use 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.770
 some colors in cream but you can 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.210
 use cream shadows pencils 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.860
 lipsticks whatever you have on hand I'll 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.990
 take a red color I will apply it for 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.370
 the whole center area of ​​this wound and they go 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.789
 give a little bit also by the sides 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.949
 of the same wound through the center of the 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.090
 silicone then I will give several points 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.370
 of intensity for that I'm going to use 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.719
 first a brown and then a black the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.550
 brown is going to be a bit more 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.930
 wide by the edges taking it a 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.310
 little bit towards the downtown area and the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.169
 black I'm going to concentrate it mostly on 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.970
 the inner edges edges of this 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:00.999
 wound 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.999
 [Music] 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.639
 we give a touch of blur and 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.860
 integration with a brush to blur 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.840
 wider area throughout the central area 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.000
 of the wound and we're going to start creating 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.039
 the external effect that is the effect of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.740
 blow I'm going to mix one more time 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.560
 cream products and I will use your 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.020
 purple green red those you have on hand 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.960
 and I will go in a random way 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.780
 creating to taps in different ways 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.050
 as hit zones around this 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.050
 wound 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.790
 as a final touch I wanted to apply 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.520
 in blood because it's pretty eye-catching and 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.890
 can stain too much so I opted 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.700
 by applying a little Vaseline 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.350
 transparent in the inner area of ​​the 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.600
 wound this is going to give us that effect of 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.040
 juiciness without staining too much 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.050
 it can be blood and we're already 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.130
 finished this is the makeup that I'm 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.130
 prepared for this unemployed 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.220
