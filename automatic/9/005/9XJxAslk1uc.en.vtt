00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:11.969
 As we made coin locker this time, we want to introduce 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 At first the rear is like this and it is quite compact compared to other things 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.890
 This button does not let the and it takes lock 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:26.310
 And the place to put this important thing is also locked and taken out 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.530
 No, but I 'll put in money from here 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.970
 Lock is released and opened 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.850
 And what's important here 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 In addition to having put 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 Here Osso 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.630
 Coins will be returned and wake up 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.650
 In addition , it is a mechanism that it takes 6 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.820
 When you also begin to dance 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.710
 Put a coin 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.990
 Put out 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.050
 I 'll put it in again 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:06.360
 This was and 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.360
 It will take 6 times each time you listen at and will introduce the Nagano system 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.600
 Putt gets broken 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.920
 This is how the Nagano system works 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 So why not get this part in the hollow where this thing is left 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.380
 Because it was stuck 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.880
 At the However part of the whiff and put your gold Patty 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.960
 Was Imaichi going to be taken out 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.390
 And here 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 And Ha' the things important 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.330
 Since the hole coin drops and press put come 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.360
 Koga-gun and Toku Link parts go down and the wings are transformed 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.600
 And if you subtract 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.240
 Because the picnic parts fall in this hollow 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:03.340
 In addition, it has been fired off the lock is applied 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.340
 Thank you for watching this end the introduction of the coin locker
