00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
just to see the difference and yeah the

Kobe<00:03:05.430> tens<00:03:05.640> do<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.390> guess<00:03:07.050> what<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.350> would

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
Kobe tens do have I guess what you would

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.420 
Kobe tens do have I guess what you would
say<00:03:07.709> better<00:03:07.950> feel<00:03:09.739> but<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.830> course<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> Kobe

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
say better feel but of course the Kobe

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.259 
say better feel but of course the Kobe
eights<00:03:11.580> are<00:03:12.030> more<00:03:12.510> comfortable<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:15.120> that's

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
eights are more comfortable but that's

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.970 
eights are more comfortable but that's

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
color here just because just because

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.040 
color here just because just because
they<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:36.419> know<00:04:36.510> when<00:04:36.660> they<00:04:36.750> get<00:04:36.870> dirty

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
they you know when they get dirty

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.300 
they you know when they get dirty
because<00:04:37.260> that's<00:04:37.500> obviously<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.919> closest

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
because that's obviously the closest

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.650 
because that's obviously the closest
part<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.610> goes<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.060> touch<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.719 
part that goes to the touch of the
ground<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.229> when<00:04:40.860> they<00:04:40.950> get<00:04:41.190> dirty<00:04:41.370> they<00:04:41.550> don't

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
ground so when they get dirty they don't

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.659 
ground so when they get dirty they don't
show<00:04:41.940> as<00:04:42.060> much<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.950> love<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.280> when<00:04:44.400> shoes

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
right there it's got the kind of texture

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.900

same<00:05:46.840> kind<00:05:47.050> of<00:05:47.110> style<00:05:47.620> nut<00:05:48.040> style<00:05:48.550> but<00:05:48.790> the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
same kind of style nut style but the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.330 
same kind of style nut style but the
same<00:05:50.010> texture<00:05:51.010> as<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:53.110> Kobe<00:05:53.830> eights<00:05:54.010> and<00:05:54.220> what

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
same texture as the Kobe eights and what

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.950 
same texture as the Kobe eights and what
I<00:05:54.370> mean<00:05:54.520> by<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.700> is<00:05:55.000> it's<00:05:55.180> not<00:05:55.330> very<00:05:55.389> pokey

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
I mean by that is it's not very pokey

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.710 
I mean by that is it's not very pokey
like<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.200> Kobe<00:05:56.470> nines<00:05:57.120> but<00:05:58.120> it's<00:05:58.600> got<00:05:58.690> a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
like the Kobe nines but it's got a

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.120 
like the Kobe nines but it's got a
different<00:05:59.020> design<00:05:59.260> here<00:05:59.440> as<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.620> can<00:05:59.650> see<00:05:59.770> cuz

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
different design here as you can see cuz

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.860 
different design here as you can see cuz
the<00:06:00.220> other<00:06:00.250> let<00:06:01.030> me<00:06:01.090> see<00:06:01.180> if<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.300> can<00:06:01.450> grab<00:06:01.660> them

the other let me see if I can grab them
here<00:06:02.050> that<00:06:02.260> hovers<00:06:02.860> nearby<00:06:11.580> as<00:06:12.580> you<00:06:13.180> can<00:06:13.330> see

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
here that hovers nearby as you can see

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.210 
here that hovers nearby as you can see
here<00:06:13.870> it's<00:06:14.200> got<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.680> pole<00:06:14.860> keeping<00:06:15.130> but

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
here it's got the pole keeping but

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.830

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
they're flat so it's got a little bit of

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.330 
they're flat so it's got a little bit of
texture<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.139> it<00:06:17.290> but<00:06:17.560> not<00:06:17.770> as<00:06:17.919> much<00:06:18.070> as<00:06:18.220> this

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
texture to it but not as much as this

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.280 
texture to it but not as much as this
one<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:18.940> right<00:06:19.570> off<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.780> bat<00:06:19.900> I<00:06:19.930> can<00:06:20.020> actually
