00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.100
 with you the company led the reef my name is 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.480
 novel 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.420
 today I would like to tell you was 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.030
 attachments that is with red 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.119
 group which is installed on the mountain 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.760
 bikes on the example of kellys bikes 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 wearing a iglonosa means and stars 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.439
 front backdrop well and their corresponding 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.109
 support that move 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 thereby changing the relationship while driving 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.380
 how do they differ with each from 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.920
 cheap analogues are often here 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.989
 still affects the quality of materials 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 remember here and say for be 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.250
 low price bike group 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.230
 everything seems to be on the one hand 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 the same well it's just at first sight 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.590
 let's say distinguishes them better 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 materials that is used more 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.409
 light components and all parts already 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 performed by the casting method let's say they 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.369
 punching punching more is done too 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.740
 on cheap groups but cast it more 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.040
 Exactly this is all every detail we 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 switches she departure already 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.860
 appropriate form due to this 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.380
 it turns out the switch is very hard 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.440
 very durable even when meshed 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.950
 highly 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 collapse also distinguishes ie it is 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.050
 concerns the whole group 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.380
 front derailleur rear and 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.420
 Respectively, the coin is switching 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.050
 on expensive bike adventures but 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.230
 softer very supple ie you 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:55.180
 you can immediately demand to switch there 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:02:02.140
 at 3 4 speeds instantly demand is very 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:06.460
 soft should all these components mean 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.210
 from famous brand shimano doing on 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.630
 the news let's say the shaman has 9 at all 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.350
 class that is every first 3 cube in this 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.360
 for a beginner, that is, who does not need much 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.550
 often does not ride very often 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.710
 bikes they need to go there three 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.120
 four times a year it will be him 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.450
 there is not enough to buy 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 expensive cutting but when you go to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.510
 live venturi advanced you want 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.700
 getting more let's say adrenaline something 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.360
 there is to not seize anything to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.280
 everything worked like a clock there will of course be 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.300
 preferably you springs more expensive 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 no rest it works best quality then 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.420
 there is it can be compared as for example there 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.210
 here is the box mechanic box automatic 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.840
 there is 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.940
 or how best to say box in Russian 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.850
 cars in russian car and box on 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.280
 American whether there is any foreign 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.590
 cars meaning there will be a difference 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.960
 colossal that is if the profit knows 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.180
 learn how to return teasing you 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.400
 understand the beauty of say dear 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.550
 connect they just work 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.570
 flawlessly everything is done as if on 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.570
 tested 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.480
 here it is to teach him the penultimate group 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.480
 out of nine let's say it is above only dexter 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.880
 actually and therefore the price fluctuates 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.180
 us cheap groups she is alone on expensive 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.349
 she is very tall often 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 only one miss cannot be the other way round 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:46.209
 cost like a good mountain bike 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.209
 here is how all 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.860
 would not talk 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.160
 mountain bike brakes 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.780
 there are two kinds of it here so ordinary 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.780
 called vibrik that is
