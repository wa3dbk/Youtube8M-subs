00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.820 

well<00:00:04.390> I<00:00:04.480> think<00:00:04.540> I<00:00:04.840> had<00:00:05.020> a<00:00:05.050> slight<00:00:05.529> advantage

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
well I think I had a slight advantage

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.600 
well I think I had a slight advantage
when<00:00:06.580> I<00:00:06.609> first<00:00:07.060> started<00:00:07.690> my<00:00:08.650> doctoral<00:00:09.129> project

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
when I first started my doctoral project

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.879 
when I first started my doctoral project
compared<00:00:10.180> with<00:00:10.389> some<00:00:10.780> of<00:00:10.900> my<00:00:11.049> colleagues<00:00:11.290> in

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
compared with some of my colleagues in

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.060 
compared with some of my colleagues in
that<00:00:12.639> the<00:00:13.299> nature<00:00:13.690> of<00:00:13.719> this<00:00:13.900> project<00:00:14.440> meant

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
that the nature of this project meant

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.109 
that the nature of this project meant
that<00:00:15.279> I<00:00:15.309> been<00:00:16.240> given<00:00:16.690> a<00:00:16.779> title<00:00:17.050> already<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:18.340> I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
that I been given a title already and I

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.870 
that I been given a title already and I
had<00:00:19.780> the<00:00:20.260> start<00:00:20.590> of<00:00:20.830> a<00:00:20.950> reading<00:00:21.280> list<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:21.730> I

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
had the start of a reading list and I

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.140 
had the start of a reading list and I
had<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.120> short<00:00:22.450> outline<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.930> what<00:00:23.260> the<00:00:24.120> sort<00:00:25.120> of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
had a short outline of what the sort of

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.380 
had a short outline of what the sort of
project<00:00:25.560> organizers<00:00:26.850> expected<00:00:27.850> me<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.120> do

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
project organizers expected me to do

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.710 
project organizers expected me to do
which<00:00:28.690> gave<00:00:28.960> me<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.800> starting<00:00:30.400> point<00:00:30.610> that<00:00:31.539> I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
which gave me a starting point that I

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.600 
which gave me a starting point that I
could<00:00:31.930> get<00:00:32.140> stuck<00:00:32.559> in<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.890> straightaway<00:00:33.309> with

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
could get stuck in the straightaway with

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.660 
could get stuck in the straightaway with
rather<00:00:33.969> than<00:00:34.239> having<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:35.469> formulate<00:00:36.070> my<00:00:36.640> own

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
rather than having to formulate my own

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.130 
rather than having to formulate my own
idea<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.180> what<00:00:37.300> my<00:00:37.600> title<00:00:37.840> was<00:00:38.410> going<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.890> be<00:00:40.140> so

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
idea of what my title was going to be so

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.080 
idea of what my title was going to be so
I<00:00:41.530> think<00:00:41.649> when<00:00:42.040> I<00:00:42.070> first<00:00:42.430> started<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.820> stuck

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
I think when I first started I got stuck

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.360 
I think when I first started I got stuck
in<00:00:46.270> with<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.260> general<00:00:47.410> reading<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:48.070> think<00:00:48.130> I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
in with the general reading I think I

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.130 
in with the general reading I think I
started<00:00:48.730> with<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:49.000> Howard<00:00:49.300> family<00:00:49.329> with<00:00:49.989> who

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
started with the Howard family with who

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.010 
started with the Howard family with who
they<00:00:50.320> were<00:00:50.380> and<00:00:50.829> trying<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.550> understand<00:00:52.059> that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
they were and trying to understand that

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.790 
they were and trying to understand that
side<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.590> project<00:00:54.420> okay<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.540> find<00:00:55.930> that<00:00:56.230> my

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
side of the project okay I find that my

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.780 
side of the project okay I find that my
average<00:00:57.130> day<00:00:57.190> as<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.700> history<00:00:58.120> student

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
average day as a history student

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.430 
average day as a history student
probably<00:01:00.790> doesn't<00:01:01.090> really<00:01:01.239> exist<00:01:01.510> because<00:01:02.350> I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
probably doesn't really exist because I

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.330 
probably doesn't really exist because I
think<00:01:02.649> one<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.399> things<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.879> found<00:01:04.360> about

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
think one of the things I found about

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.389 
think one of the things I found about
being<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.399> history<00:01:06.700> student<00:01:06.759> not<00:01:07.329> having<00:01:08.399> sort

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
being a history student not having sort

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.160 
being a history student not having sort
of<00:01:09.429> laboratory<00:01:09.850> working<00:01:10.689> hours<00:01:10.810> or<00:01:11.049> anything

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
of laboratory working hours or anything

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.800 
of laboratory working hours or anything
like<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:12.069> that<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.759> can<00:01:13.060> be<00:01:13.479> quite

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
like that is that I can be quite

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.429 
like that is that I can be quite
flexible<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.929> terms<00:01:16.929> of<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.439> structure

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
flexible in terms of how you structure

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.289 
flexible in terms of how you structure
the<00:01:20.560> day<00:01:20.709> so<00:01:20.770> working<00:01:21.279> later<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.759> being<00:01:22.060> me<00:01:22.179> if

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
the day so working later and being me if

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.399 
the day so working later and being me if
you've<00:01:22.420> done<00:01:22.600> something<00:01:22.990> else<00:01:23.109> in<00:01:23.319> the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
you've done something else in the

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.029 
you've done something else in the
morning<00:01:23.969> as<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:25.359> general<00:01:25.719> rule<00:01:25.749> I<00:01:26.200> normally

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
morning as a general rule I normally

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.989 
morning as a general rule I normally
work<00:01:27.630> quite<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.659> lot<00:01:28.869> from<00:01:29.049> home<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.459> don't

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
work quite a lot from home so I don't

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.010 
work quite a lot from home so I don't
have<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.539> get<00:01:31.719> up<00:01:31.929> and<00:01:32.259> travel<00:01:32.679> anywhere

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
have to get up and travel anywhere

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.559 
have to get up and travel anywhere
that's<00:01:35.020> partly<00:01:35.349> because<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.920> lot<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.159> my

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
that's partly because a lot of my

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.389 
that's partly because a lot of my
sources<00:01:37.569> can<00:01:37.990> either<00:01:38.139> be<00:01:38.349> accessed<00:01:38.770> online<00:01:38.979> or

sources can either be accessed online or

sources can either be accessed online or
I<00:01:39.849> have<00:01:40.359> previously<00:01:41.049> taken<00:01:41.679> photos<00:01:42.310> or

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639 
I have previously taken photos or

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:44.459 
I have previously taken photos or
transcriptions<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.659> them<00:01:43.929> which<00:01:44.079> I've<00:01:44.289> then

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
transcriptions of them which I've then

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.219 
transcriptions of them which I've then
brought<00:01:44.709> home<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.639> analyze<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.479> greater<00:01:46.810> depth

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.620 

some<00:01:50.229> days<00:01:50.469> I<00:01:50.829> will<00:01:51.099> come<00:01:51.639> into<00:01:51.789> Oxford

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
some days I will come into Oxford
