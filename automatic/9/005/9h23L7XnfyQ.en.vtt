00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 I do not like the idea of who says that your

 food for sick dirty water a lot 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.189
 super new and rich in nutrients and flavor 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.169

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.000
 of vegetables that can be served from three 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.250
 superinteressing shapes 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.020
 the first is in bread the second is in the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 moranga and the third my form 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.059
 favorite inside a pizza dough 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.149
 with border of cream cheese curd 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.480
 shelby the request to our people to us already 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.480
 begins 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.370
 to start you should bring a pan 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.840
 sizzles to medium heat 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.760
 If you are full take a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.369
 pressure cooker and place two 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 tablespoons olive oil add 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.970
 still one clove of garlic and one 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.530
 diced onion 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.390
 cook over medium heat to stay after 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.070
 add a tablet of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.050
 meat expect to melt if you want 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.910
 put a piece of red meat or 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.550
 It is at this moment that you should 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.930
 to do the little pieces of raw food together and scrolls 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.000
 beef steak 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 the olive oil and let the fry well 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 get very dry with my cup 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.280
 water and coffee follow the recipe that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.110
 moment you should add some vegetables 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.149
 chopped of your preference 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.190
 I'm going to put here first a tomato without 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.200
 seed stayed in pieces and sauté for 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.670
 about 30 seconds to soften and release the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.380
 flavor 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.030
 I will now add a potato in 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:59.570
 Pieces of rain on a carrot cubes 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.570
 sliced and a manioc into pieces 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.840
 cook everything for a minute in the broth 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.459
 meat and then put water in the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.459
 to cover all the vegetables 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.580
 The dance fest was pressure if it was not 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.580
 of capped xcm and let cook on fire 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.290
 high 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.239
 so boil or get pressure below 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.129
 the medium heat and cook until the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.590
 vegetables to soften about 20 minutes 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.010
 in the pressure or 45 minutes in a pan 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.010
 normal 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.459
 past cooking time slide 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.560
 waiting for pressure to leave full 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.290
 careful I never opened a pan 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.390
 press ahead of time and transfer the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.739
 vegetables cooked by a blender or 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.739
 knock with the help of a mixer 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.830
 finally try and if you are 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.870
 missing salt put a pinch after 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.760
 to hit the soup is interesting you 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.070
 put the accompaniments that you 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.710
 want rice or pasta to appear half 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.800
 cup of tea and then 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.440
 return to the medium heat to cook for 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.090
 about 15 minutes until softened 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.790
 but you can also consume the cream 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.120
 course that the favorite shape is super 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.340
 take it easy and now I'll show you three ways 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.920
 very interesting to serve the soup 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.560
 the first is inside an Italian bread 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.100
 round you just cut the cover here 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.959
 in the sequence remove the crumb and want 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.910
 put a little bit of mozzarella cheese 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.010
 to seal the bottom in the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.200
 Following just pour the cream and 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.570
 finish with a little parsley and 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.610
 parmesan a second super form 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.070
 healthy serving of this dish is within 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.790
 of a moranga a cooked moranga and 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.050
 clean 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.820
 if you do not remember how you do this 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.080
 We've already taught you our process. 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.330
 shrimp video 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.459
 now if you want to put the broth 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.640
 finish with a little parmesan and the 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.959
 and has a third form of 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.720
 serve the dish which is my favorite 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.570
 that inside a cone and pizza 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.640
 with border of cream cheese curd 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.800
 scherer or concretize and to do is 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.959
 It's super easy, just make our mark. 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.220
 Perfect margarita pizza reminds of her 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.169
 if you do not remember quica in the video that 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.419
 appeared on your screen and then make the 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.890
 mass just open pick up pieces one 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.270
 little bigger than the way they 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.940
 Are you going to use it if you had 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.460
 these information can be sent 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.530
 may be some dots that might go 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.530
 the oven or else camp molds 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.080
 keith then cut the pieces of the dough 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.050
 can pass a little of the filling on the edge 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.400
 folded in and went inside the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.360
 the way we have done with our 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.110
 tapioca tapes reminds 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.030
 taking advantage of the fact that this process is a 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.640
 It takes a little time, I want to ask a favor 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.500
 Do you like the video you do not like? 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.850

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.680
 job 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.289
 in the sequence so medium oven 180 degrees 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.880
 is 25 minutes until browning after is the 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.789
 same process can put a little bit 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.090
