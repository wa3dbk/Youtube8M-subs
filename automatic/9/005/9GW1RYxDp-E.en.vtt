00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.230
 Well, you would only have commented 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.029
 that we believe that from this second 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.100
 half of the month of December and facing 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.200
 what is first of this year the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.760
 situations of Atlantic storms are 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.620
 they will give more often in fact 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.880
 we come in these moments we are in a 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.830
 train of squalls on train 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.630
 explosive cyclogenesis we have made a 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.850
 article days ago and we are following 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.230
 the track of a storm that next 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.789
 this week and will start out the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.029
 means of communication starting from 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.189
 today 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.869
 a storm that possibly now 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.699
 same the main models work 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.500
 with this possibility I can reach about 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.509
 minimum pressure values ​​that will be 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.889
 possibly historical we are talking 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.269
 that numerical models work 

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:37.940
 with pressure values that can reach 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.799
 to 930,000 and bars or pascal is a 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.269
 storm that would be very close to 

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.010
 the British Isles and that 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.170
 then we will have more 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.850
 good detail well now we are going to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.739
 analyze the situation with this map that 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.209
 we have here is a wind map without going 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.399
 let's see how this storm is going to 

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:53.749
 deepen quickly from the zone of 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.699
 Newfoundland direction towards the islands 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.260
 British and let's see how the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.569
 winds go to the intensity from 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.549
 practically last morning hours of 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.049
 Sunday and from the northeast position 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.850
 of the islands of techniques is not going to 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.970
 focus will affect virtually 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.980
 everyone 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.450
 the European continent we are going to start 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.530
 what is the animation we see how 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.870
 our moments here in the peninsula 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.940
 Iberian 'we have this situation of 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.200
 winds that are blowing especially 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.150
 intensely in the area of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 British and here we see the formation of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.550
 this stormy as of tomorrow sunday 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.680
 in the afternoon it will go deeper 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.990
 more and more the winds as we can 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 see they will be gaining in intensity we see 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.530
 here the nucleus is not the islands 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.330
 British as practically everything to the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.300
 western half included what is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.130
 Spain is affected by this storm 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
 very deep in the process of cyclogenesis 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.180
 explosive and everything that is this 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.890
 situation here of winds of origin 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.960
 polar maritime will continue to affect us 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.940
 radio action adolescence 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860
 face the following days but apart 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.930
 from behind we see how a new 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970
 squall coming out of Newfoundland 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.369
 I would return it will continue to deepen as 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.290
 the previous one and in depth the winds 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.759
 very intense winds that follow 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 moving another of these operations 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.500
 British, affecting again what 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.180
 is the Galician community that in Galicia and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.590
 practically to the rest of Spain ' 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.940
 the extensive realization of these 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.390
 Storms allow them to affect 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.290
 practically the entire western half 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.580
 later as we see they are still here 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.490
 the low pressures for high 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.920
 pressures 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.690
 but it would continue entering low 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.160
 pressures from the Newfoundland area 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.630
 we will have to follow the evolution to see 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.630
 If this situation has continuity
