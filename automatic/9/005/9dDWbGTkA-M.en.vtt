making sure that you have all your
mechanics<00:01:46.470> correctly<00:01:47.340> before<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.180> start

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
mechanics correctly before you start

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.840 
mechanics correctly before you start
doing<00:01:49.229> putting<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.950> move<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.549> shot

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
doing putting a little move to your shot

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.810 
doing putting a little move to your shot
it<00:01:51.720> also<00:01:52.079> gives<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.250> great<00:01:53.549> confidence

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it also gives you great confidence

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.209 
it also gives you great confidence
because<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.170> only<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.710> three<00:01:55.950> feet

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
because if you're only two or three feet

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.190 
because if you're only two or three feet
away<00:01:56.399> from<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> basket<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.869> should<00:01:58.049> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
away from the basket you should have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.069 
away from the basket you should have
good<00:01:58.409> mechanics<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.850> mechanics<00:02:00.420> should

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
good mechanics and good mechanics should

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.469 
good mechanics and good mechanics should
equal<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> lot<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.770> made<00:02:01.950> shots<00:02:02.280> made<00:02:03.119> shots

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
equal a lot of made shots made shots

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
equal a lot of made shots made shots
equal<00:02:04.110> confidence<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.860> again<00:02:05.130> confidence<00:02:05.549> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
equal confidence and again confidence is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.570 
equal confidence and again confidence is
very<00:02:05.969> important<00:02:06.950> alright<00:02:07.950> we've<00:02:08.099> warmed<00:02:08.399> up

spot before moving to the next tier if

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.100 
spot before moving to the next tier if
you're<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> big<00:02:32.940> guy<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.390> maybe<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:34.050> a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you're a big guy and maybe on a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.020 
you're a big guy and maybe on a
three-point<00:02:34.739> shooter<00:02:35.010> then<00:02:35.550> maybe<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.910> do

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
three-point shooter then maybe you do

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.059 
three-point shooter then maybe you do
the<00:02:36.180> first<00:02:36.420> tier<00:02:36.660> twice<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.470> second<00:02:37.890> tier

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
the first tier twice the second tier

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.680 
the first tier twice the second tier
once<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.879> it<00:02:38.970> looks<00:02:39.150> something<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
once but it looks something like this

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.140 
once but it looks something like this
i'm<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.890> start<00:02:41.160> five<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.760> seven<00:02:42.120> feet

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
i'm going to start five to seven feet

i'm going to start five to seven feet
i'm<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> follow<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:43.650> shot<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.580> go<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
i'm going to follow my shot and go to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.670 
i'm going to follow my shot and go to
the<00:02:45.300> next<00:02:45.510> spot<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.080> other<00:02:46.230> side<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the next spot on the other side of the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.710 
the next spot on the other side of the
floor<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.610> same<00:02:47.879> tier<00:02:48.480> i<00:02:48.780> must<00:02:49.410> make<00:02:49.680> every

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
floor in the same tier i must make every

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.750 
floor in the same tier i must make every
shot<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:51.900> each<00:02:52.019> spot<00:02:52.200> before<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:53.010> move<00:02:53.190> I've

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
shot at each spot before I can move I've

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.150 
shot at each spot before I can move I've
made<00:02:53.819> two<00:02:54.239> shots<00:02:54.569> on<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> baseline<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:56.040> I'm

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
made two shots on the baseline then I'm

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.970 
made two shots on the baseline then I'm
going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.370> move<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.849> wind<00:02:57.739> I'm<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:58.890> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
going to move to the wind I'm going to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
going to move to the wind I'm going to
follow<00:02:59.220> my<00:02:59.430> shot<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.269> there<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.599> see<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
follow my shot so there you see the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.500 
follow my shot so there you see the
cardio<00:03:01.349> you've<00:03:02.010> got<00:03:02.220> movement<00:03:02.519> let's<00:03:03.360> get

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
cardio you've got movement let's get

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.830 
cardio you've got movement let's get
your<00:03:03.690> feet<00:03:03.930> set<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.790> follow<00:03:06.150> your<00:03:06.330> shot<00:03:06.629> with

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
your feet set and follow your shot with

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.559 
your feet set and follow your shot with
your<00:03:06.959> all<00:03:07.200> good<00:03:07.230> habits<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.040> shooting<00:03:08.569> last

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
your all good habits and shooting last

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.199 
your all good habits and shooting last
and<00:03:09.959> final<00:03:10.110> spot<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.800> as<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.849> can<00:03:14.970> see

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
and final spot and there as you can see

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.930 
and final spot and there as you can see
very<00:03:16.170> good<00:03:16.349> drill<00:03:16.620> get<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.159> it<00:03:17.340> work<00:03:17.760> on

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
very good drill get you with it work on

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.869 
very good drill get you with it work on
conditioning<00:03:18.860> concentration<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.489> gives<00:03:20.790> you

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
conditioning concentration and gives you

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.820 
conditioning concentration and gives you
great<00:03:21.090> confidence<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:22.200> make<00:03:22.379> shots<00:03:22.620> while

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
great confidence you make shots while

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.580 
great confidence you make shots while
you're<00:03:22.950> tired<00:03:23.330> ok<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:24.390> let's<00:03:24.659> recap<00:03:24.900> our<00:03:25.290> drill

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you're tired ok so let's recap our drill

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.800 
you're tired ok so let's recap our drill
around<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> world<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.209> three-tiered

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
around the world it's a three-tiered

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.589 
around the world it's a three-tiered
drill<00:03:28.200> there<00:03:28.769> are<00:03:28.920> five<00:03:29.159> spots<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.849> each<00:03:30.180> tier

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
drill there are five spots in each tier

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.780 
drill there are five spots in each tier
you<00:03:31.170> must<00:03:31.409> make<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> shot<00:03:31.980> from<00:03:32.159> each<00:03:32.430> spot

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you must make a shot from each spot

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.180
