00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.890
 wanted to talk about cultural differences 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.750
 generally in America for ticked draw 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.470
 Francis is a big topic and here 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.060
 dissertations writes and lectures are read and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.070
 staff at work instructs what 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.160
 here take out that people from different countries 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.600
 they are not something that would tell you are going to some 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.000
 cold culture is different 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.730
 so they do things differently and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.010
 it is necessary to take this into account and I 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.429
 without any modeling but just talking 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.879
 arose 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:40.749
 with former student 1 there is a story here 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.030
 what a woman she kitayanochka itself from 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:47.440
 taiwan others may be now 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.179
 perhaps years, I do not even know it 40-42 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.069
 so small very pretty 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:57.100
 fun clockwork such hurricane aunt and 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:01:01.179
 married to an american they have two kids 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.030
 and so she generally education is ethical 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.719
 I have received and worked for many years vorog 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.180
 was there some kind of monitor manager 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.820
 you know there is one level there 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 2 level 3 there was not such a lansika and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.880
 that is, she was at some kind of war 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.880
 But due to the fact that in a row there are two kids 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.600
 she was at some point in her life she 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 somehow fell out of circulation such 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.859
 professional despite the fact that she has a husband 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 well earns and no one seems to be 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.740
 They are in trouble even at night 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.929
 do it without the money but what 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.090
 the moment when children have grown up and already 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.810
 Of course it would be scary to sit at home 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.289
 here it was sent to us with on implant 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.799
 there is money for people who 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.539
 lost job or not working there it 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.509
 it's not important to get for not doing so 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.020
 unemployment benefits but it is important that 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.270
 country wants 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.789
 how to put them back in operation 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 so they paid taxes there is money for 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.439
 this and here she came to us to study here 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.500
 under this state program for her 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.870
 paid to plus she kinda on one side 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.260
 technical other person 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.590
 very well, almost American 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.860
 here and on the third side it is still 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.670
 chief and how would she just like that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.200
 we test the tester to work like you 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.629
 even but why suddenly 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.410
 but it does not matter short first job she 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.730
 was immediately a manager in a company that 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.560
 makes a solid-state hard drive 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.480
 but there did not last long gone 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.810
 some startup was there too 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.760
 head of testing and a year later 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.980
 It went well, because it happened then 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 the company went public it got 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.870
 a lot of money and she no longer had any sense there 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.389
 work from she she had stocks by 5 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.489
 dollars and in a year they already became 55 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.739
 + she was the boss she had a lot 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.970
 shares to apply moves thinks where 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.550
 money but this is a separate story and here 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.480
 she comes like that sometimes for lunch me 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.630
 takes she here lives next to and so how 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.230
 we are friends and here's a little know you 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.120
 never go together she is my height well up 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.580
 navel it would be but on such a heel 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 hefty climb who is not visible 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.530
 because the pants she has to the ground in the end 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.120
 how do you hide these heels that's how it is 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.730
 getting a little higher navel here on 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.390
 The size of these heels is very funny and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.140
 such 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.950
 in its own way cool woman and here she is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.530
 I complain 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.200
 but she feels like a Chinese woman and 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.500
 From China, that is, in their native language, Chinese 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.930
 she speaks with an accent and it is so 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.970
 light good accents kids walk 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.890
 learn Chinese while dad 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.550
 whites there and so on in general 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.050
 and she says here we are Chinese she says 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.850
 here are completely helpless then 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.750
 certain situations here we do not know 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.280
 how generally how to deal with it and so 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.790
 there I am about for about a year now 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.060
 eg 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.459
 she says I have there in parallel 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.709
 it means otherwise for the sake of but it turns out like this 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.640
 there they have two food groups where she 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:19.560
 works and it is by post called 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.240
 senior qa manager blue bright manager and 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.410
 There is one more from India there comrade 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.620
 who annoys her 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.200
 he is not seÃ±or kilimanjaro he is 7 thin 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.270
 director that is 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.470
 as if above but they are not each other 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.200
 subordinate 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.480
 mutually that is, they are on different projects 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.800
 work but sometimes they discuss 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.880
 any questions and she says that 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.980
 it means but already as an American 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.380
 reasons that is she when it is 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.570
 comes up about something technical she 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.550
 reasons and technical that is how would 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.150
 discuss technical issues and no one 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.800
 it is a fool but when she is with him 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.290
 start to discuss something and he 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.770
 the arguments end and he has nothing to say 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.140
 and he tells her notes singer manager 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.670
 yak vi director and it means 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.400
 should mean his opinion is more expensive 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.800
 It is worth this here and it does not 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.300
 and I don't even know what to say to him. 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.350
 I do not understand what to say to him 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.360
 that's what it says out of rushi 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.610
 what would you say at this moment when 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.320
 you say this berry is very 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.440
 I just don't give you anything at all 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.780
 sometimes it is profitable to say what and 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.540
 energy this eyes burn with her so she 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.500
 whole and enthusiastic full 9 what to say i 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.830
 I repent tell him the fact she is so eyes 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.470
 rolled and said oh michael vg 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.060
 a and higher end and z vanda i mean a 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.340
 after all, literally a year, I so want to 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.840
 One day I was able to tell him 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.390
 that is, she appreciated 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.390
 convincing argument but how would 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:01.680
 here's Chinese culture specifically not 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.080
 allows something like this from this side 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.129
 approach the issue 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.840
 so actually bounce off what if 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.259
 we will compare Russian with American 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.800
 culture of reasoning is like logic 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.990
 arguments then Americans in that sense 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.840
 little internet weird when he has 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.840
 running out of arguments american scratching 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.449
 turnips and says you know probably you 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.520
 right well, that is, if there is nothing to argue 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.469
 it means you are true and he is at the same time 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.180
 quite personally nothing incurs 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.819
 that is, as if this is not something that he is there 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:41.190
 personally well yes it seems you are probably right once 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:44.039
 That's how we traditionally when the arguments 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.719
 end we yes would you go 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.180
 completely different approach we all have 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:51.060
 equally right though we have arguments and no 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.150
 but how would we look at it that way 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.479
 so I wanted to draw your attention 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:00.810
 here are some cultural developments 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.650
 between people living in Russia and China 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.650
 india 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.219
 Hello everyone and the beginning of the new labor 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.219
 of the week
