00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello everyone, today I want with you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 share your joy 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
 I finally got the long-awaited 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.660
 package from buyincoins website 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.370
 making an order on December 26th and she came to me 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.670
 yesterday 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.130
 February 26 about February 14, I wrote 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.859
 to buyincoins website asking to check 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.039
 did my package come back to them 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.230
 I was answered two days later by my 16 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 like February 1 and asked to wait another 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 5-10 business days what is happening now 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.309
 delays supposedly basically happened 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.410
 There are 26 numbers I already got it but 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.739
 principle delivery time is obtained 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 enough still long in my case 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.329
 it's exactly two months and so what am i 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.500
 ordered let's start with such little things 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.329
 This rezinochki for hair color frames 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.829
 gum good enough keeps well 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 I honestly have more hair 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 like this one gum why matter 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
 in that we wrap up anyway 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.080
 her around the tail or around the pigtail 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.150
 several times and using these 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.000
 artificial hair can be blocked here 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.470
 this black part in the same case 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.150
 it turns out we have nothing to block and here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.000
 It turns out not very carefully, that is, and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.799
 a pigtail is and a rubber band is so 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 if you order slices give you 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.909
 Here such an entire order will come in handy 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 ideally following the advice of my hair and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.729
 perfectly does not fit further I ordered 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.220
 such a net so-called brooch garth 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.710
 would like to show you see for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.930
 brushes for example and ready bronzer brush 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 this cotos came up she holds perfectly 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.110
 form 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.680
 and with this wander horde brush but here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 for example and pours in mac 217 here 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 these she easily removed and put on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.890
 in fact, the shape of this brush is not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.130
 hold therefore for wide brushes yes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.720
 this is a good thing this garage mountains but 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.070
 for such a small brush on 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.220
 principle not to say that the same 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.020
 small thing that exists model 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.870
 need not too wide beach garth further 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.880
 here we have a hardware manicure 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.950
 certainly nothing for three dollars i especially 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.140
 I did not expect to use it but end up with it 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.030
 still will not be that he is in a box 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.740
 the box is a little bit completely changed 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.410
 but everything remained safe and sound 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.830
 box rarely threw want to show 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:27.890
 nozzles and tara presented here and here 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.690
 the device itself does not look like this 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.300
 very neat pouch pouch too 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.709
 walked in this box so here is the set 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.840
 everything remained safe and sound on 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.370
 I will not use that somehow I do not 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.650
 liked not and neatly all this 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.740
 done when you spin this one 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.660
 part of the plastic all the cracks will need 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.390
 finger batteries to 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.050
 use hardware manicure 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.970
 next means palette concealers 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.580
 well known , I can't 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.500
 Swatch to do you can only specify 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.940
 colors are actually on the site all colors 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.830
 seem much lighter so i 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.810
 I can perfectly use this 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.459
 Only this here if I want everything 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.690
 the rest to me too dark that is, 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.000
 can be used for contouring 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.550
 so colors of course you can 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.709
 use to red 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.620
 just choose one and all the rest 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.269
 colors for example like these here these i 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.269
 for example , I can not even use 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.360
 In the summer case I will not do it because 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.920
 we plan to donate these palettes sochi 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.549
 In principle , the Internet is full 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.250
 so this palette 10 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.900
 A little blush saying palette is very 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.799
 liked a little bit camera 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.360
 it is lit up they are a little brighter 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.010
 what leg of the world is clear how you see not 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.840
 scattered everything left intact and 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.860
 everything was beautifully preserved 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.800
 all three palettes went separately they were 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.470
 laid turns out foam and 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.580
 loaded among themselves in principle 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.350
 they could not break 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.630
 by the way was very well packed 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.300
 the parcel was all this stuff in 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.450
 pimples ca n't break anything 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.600
 only if I tried very hard 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.600
 further such palette for contouring 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.780
 These 20 can be used as 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.400
 powder for light skin skin slightly 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 darker even this color can 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.540
 Whether used as a light powder bou hast 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.630
 skin as which it is 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.750
 also contouring highlighter and that's it 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.640
 peach daisy very nice whole 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.380
 I think this palette will fit more 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.820
 people with a yellow undertone 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.550
 they are with a pink undertone because 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.340
 notice all the flowers go 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.310
 yellow undertone except of course 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.350
 highlighter he's pure white and on 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.180
 the last thing I got is this 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.700
 an organizer that can be used 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.870
 calculation designed for lipstick but you can 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.100
 use it and for example brushes 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.370
 that's the way tassels come here 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.160
 inserted does not fall conveniently that is 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.350
 so that everything does not roll on the tables comfortably 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.990
 everything can be put here 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.270
 organize and so here is my whole order 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.550
 buyincoins site 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.700
 In principle, I stayed quite ordered 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.040
 of course with reverse vanilla time dunk 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.800
 such a price miscalculated 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.270
 wait, I could not well everything else 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.790
 strictly speaking corresponds to those 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.010
 criteria that were stated on the site 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.380
 and so goodbye everyone thank you 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.380
 get for watching new meetings
