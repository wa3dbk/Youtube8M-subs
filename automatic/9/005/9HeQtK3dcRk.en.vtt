case<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.430> did<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
case you did see that one and be kind of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
case you did see that one and be kind of
repetitive<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.890> needless<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.759> say<00:01:26.970> i

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
repetitive for you but needless to say i

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.270 
repetitive for you but needless to say i
love<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.600> I've<00:01:27.810> been<00:01:27.930> wearing<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
love this I've been wearing it for the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
love this I've been wearing it for the
last<00:01:29.400> couple<00:01:29.640> months<00:01:29.909> almost<00:01:30.570> every<00:01:30.869> single

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
last couple months almost every single

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
last couple months almost every single
day<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> only<00:01:31.650> time<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.100> didn't<00:01:32.460> wear<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
day the only time that I didn't wear it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.749 
day the only time that I didn't wear it
was<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> Korea<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.460> reason

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
was when I was in Korea and the reason

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
was when I was in Korea and the reason
for<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.750> does<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.140> SPF<00:01:37.619> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
for that is because it does have SPF in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.830 
for that is because it does have SPF in
it<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.280> SPF<00:01:38.759> 20<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.240> isn't<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it it's SPF 20 which isn't really that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.889 
it it's SPF 20 which isn't really that
high<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.950> notice<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
high but I do notice that it can have a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.020 
high but I do notice that it can have a
little<00:01:43.110> bit<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.350> white<00:01:43.590> cast<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.280> photographs

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
little bit of white cast in photographs

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
little bit of white cast in photographs
it's<00:01:45.270> nothing<00:01:45.600> crazy<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:47.009> noticeable

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it's nothing crazy but it was noticeable

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's nothing crazy but it was noticeable
to<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.450> didn't<00:01:48.810> really<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> bring

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to me so I didn't really want to bring

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
to me so I didn't really want to bring
it<00:01:49.890> along<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.340> trip<00:01:50.640> even<00:01:50.970> though<00:01:51.090> would

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it along on that trip even though would

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
it along on that trip even though would
have<00:01:51.540> been<00:01:51.689> great<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.009> does

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
have been great for that because it does

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
have been great for that because it does
have<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.520> SPF<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.960> do

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
have the SPF in it one thing that I do

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.450 
have the SPF in it one thing that I do
want<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> mention<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.920> product<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
want to mention about this product that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
want to mention about this product that
I<00:01:56.520> think<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.820> important<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.780> case

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I think is important and just in case

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.389 
I think is important and just in case
you<00:01:58.049> haven't<00:01:58.229> seen<00:01:58.500> those<00:01:58.590> other<00:01:58.799> videos<00:01:59.189> is

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you haven't seen those other videos is

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.100 
you haven't seen those other videos is
that<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.119> can't<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that you can't think of this as a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.649 
that you can't think of this as a
regular<00:02:01.619> BB<00:02:01.950> cream<00:02:02.250> most<00:02:02.880> BB<00:02:03.149> creams<00:02:03.420> will

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
regular BB cream most BB creams will

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
regular BB cream most BB creams will
have<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> decent<00:02:04.110> amount<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.530> coverage<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
have a decent amount of coverage and you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.380 
have a decent amount of coverage and you
can<00:02:05.430> use<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.119> tinted

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
can use it kind of like a tinted

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.330 
can use it kind of like a tinted
moisturizer<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:07.079> instead<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.740> foundation

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
moisturizer or instead of foundation

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.440 
moisturizer or instead of foundation
this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
this is not like that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.180 
this is not like that
which<00:02:10.660> they<00:02:10.899> didn't<00:02:11.290> call<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.739> beauty<00:02:12.010> balm

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
which they didn't call it a beauty balm

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.880 
which they didn't call it a beauty balm
because<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.209> honestly<00:02:13.930> more<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.410> primer

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
because it's honestly more of a primer

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.860 
because it's honestly more of a primer
it<00:02:15.250> doesn't<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.849> any<00:02:16.060> coverage<00:02:16.420> at<00:02:16.569> all<00:02:16.690> it's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
it doesn't have any coverage at all it's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.070 
it doesn't have any coverage at all it's
a<00:02:16.959> translucent<00:02:17.530> finish<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.300> just

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
a translucent finish but it I just

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960 
a translucent finish but it I just
really<00:02:20.470> like<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> feeling<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.730> since

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
really like the feeling of it and since

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.640 
really like the feeling of it and since
I<00:02:22.090> don't<00:02:22.360> use<00:02:22.540> primers<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> lot<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.379> times<00:02:23.560> they

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
I don't use primers a lot of times they

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.080 
I don't use primers a lot of times they
break<00:02:23.830> out<00:02:23.980> my<00:02:24.069> skin<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.879> has<00:02:25.060> been

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
break out my skin this has been

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.490 
break out my skin this has been
something<00:02:25.390> that's<00:02:25.510> really<00:02:25.900> great<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.349> me

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
something that's really great for me

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.680 
something that's really great for me
it's<00:02:26.769> slightly<00:02:27.099> mattifying<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.480> feels

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
it's slightly mattifying and it feels

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.630 
it's slightly mattifying and it feels
very<00:02:28.959> smooth<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.920> said<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.220> has<00:02:30.370> that

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
very smooth it like I said it has that

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.809 
very smooth it like I said it has that
primer<00:02:31.030> feel<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:32.349> my<00:02:32.890> skin<00:02:33.220> just<00:02:33.250> reacts<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
primer feel but my skin just reacts to a

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.000 
primer feel but my skin just reacts to a
little<00:02:34.120> bit<00:02:34.239> better<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.660> kind<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.590> mixture

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
little bit better it's kind of a mixture

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.800 
little bit better it's kind of a mixture
between<00:02:36.069> like<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.580> moisturizer<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.510> primer

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
between like a moisturizer and a primer

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.720 
between like a moisturizer and a primer
so<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.950> wanted<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.280> put<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.459> out<00:02:39.610> there

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
so just wanted to put that out there

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.690 
so just wanted to put that out there
just<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.299> case<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.750> did<00:02:40.989> buy<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.680> $34<00:02:42.549> I

believe and I don't want you to buy
something<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.489> translucent<00:02:45.940> without

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
something that is translucent without

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.850 
something that is translucent without
knowing<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:47.049> translucent<00:02:47.470> it's

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
knowing that it's translucent it's

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.309 
knowing that it's translucent it's
really<00:02:48.190> something<00:02:48.400> that's<00:02:48.819> more<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.870> use<00:02:50.049> as

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
really something that's more to use as

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.750 
really something that's more to use as
like<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> primer<00:02:50.950> or<00:02:51.250> if<00:02:51.340> you're<00:02:51.459> someone

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
like a primer or if you're someone

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.339 
like a primer or if you're someone
that's<00:02:51.819> young<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.420> doesn't<00:02:52.510> need<00:02:52.780> makeup<00:02:52.989> or

that's young and doesn't need makeup or

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.020 
that's young and doesn't need makeup or
doesn't<00:02:53.650> wear<00:02:53.799> makeup<00:02:53.829> this<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:54.940> be

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
doesn't wear makeup this is going to be

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.250 
doesn't wear makeup this is going to be
something<00:02:55.209> that's<00:02:55.329> good<00:02:55.630> for<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.930> because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
something that's good for you because

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.949 
something that's good for you because
it's<00:02:56.410> slightly<00:02:56.650> mattifying<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.940> got<00:02:58.120> SPF<00:02:58.569> 20

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
it's slightly mattifying it's got SPF 20

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.710 
it's slightly mattifying it's got SPF 20
in<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.470> just<00:03:00.069> I<00:03:00.400> think<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.329> would<00:03:01.450> be<00:03:01.569> good

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
in it and just I think it would be good

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.990 
in it and just I think it would be good
for<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.049> so<00:03:02.319> for<00:03:02.829> me<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.280> reason<00:03:03.430> why<00:03:03.640> i<00:03:03.700> use

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
for that so for me the reason why i use

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.640 
for that so for me the reason why i use
it<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.329> because<00:03:04.840> i'm<00:03:05.110> not<00:03:05.230> wearing<00:03:05.470> foundation

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
it is because i'm not wearing foundation

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.039 
it is because i'm not wearing foundation
i'm<00:03:06.130> only<00:03:06.310> spot<00:03:06.670> concealing<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.569> then

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
i'm only spot concealing and then

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.920 
i'm only spot concealing and then
concealer<00:03:08.530> under<00:03:08.769> my<00:03:08.799> eyes<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.760> need<00:03:10.150> kind

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
of that extra moisture that I would

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.420 
of that extra moisture that I would
normally<00:03:12.640> get<00:03:13.030> from<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.299> liquid<00:03:13.480> foundation<00:03:14.140> so

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.999 
think
even<00:04:22.389> had<00:04:22.569> it<00:04:22.599> in<00:04:22.810> hits<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.199> misses<00:04:23.319> video<00:04:23.710> yet

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
even had it in hits and misses video yet

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.129 
even had it in hits and misses video yet
because<00:04:24.490> my<00:04:25.240> hits<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.569> misses<00:04:25.629> are<00:04:25.900> always

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
because my hits and misses are always

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.719 
because my hits and misses are always
late<00:04:26.349> and<00:04:26.379> this<00:04:26.650> actually<00:04:26.860> didn't<00:04:27.310> last<00:04:27.520> that

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
late and this actually didn't last that

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.390 
late and this actually didn't last that
long<00:04:27.970> so<00:04:28.389> this<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.289> Anastasia<00:04:30.099> brow<00:04:30.370> Wiz

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
long so this is the Anastasia brow Wiz

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.670 
long so this is the Anastasia brow Wiz
in<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.180> color<00:04:31.389> caramel<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.319> I<00:04:32.379> think<00:04:32.620> I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
in the color caramel and I think I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.379 
in the color caramel and I think I
finally<00:04:32.979> found<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.550> combination<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.180> brow

thought it was getting too dark the
thing<00:05:06.159> that<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.340> didn't<00:05:06.759> like<00:05:06.970> about<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.479> brow

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
thing that I didn't like about the brow

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.529 
thing that I didn't like about the brow
powder<00:05:08.319> is<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:09.009> I<00:05:09.280> felt<00:05:09.849> like<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.120> filled<00:05:10.389> it

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
powder is that I felt like it filled it

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.200 
powder is that I felt like it filled it
in<00:05:10.630> too<00:05:11.080> much<00:05:11.289> like<00:05:11.590> it<00:05:11.710> was<00:05:11.860> too<00:05:12.310> hard<00:05:12.639> to<00:05:13.030> get

in too much like it was too hard to get

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.850 
in too much like it was too hard to get
it<00:05:13.440> natural-looking<00:05:14.440> because<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.520> powder<00:05:15.789> I

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
it natural-looking because the powder I

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.140 
it natural-looking because the powder I
don't<00:05:17.860> know<00:05:17.949> I<00:05:17.979> was<00:05:18.219> always<00:05:18.400> used<00:05:18.639> to<00:05:18.729> pencil

don't know I was always used to pencil
anyway<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.509> used<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.900> use<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.229> Rimmel<00:05:20.560> one

which I do still like but it's a little
bit<00:05:23.979> redder<00:05:24.250> than<00:05:24.550> this<00:05:24.699> one<00:05:24.909> this<00:05:25.090> is<00:05:25.150> very

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
bit redder than this one this is very

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.370

very close to the Rimmel 02 hazel except

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.100 
very close to the Rimmel 02 hazel except
the<00:05:30.039> Rimmel<00:05:30.940> one<00:05:31.090> is<00:05:31.270> just<00:05:31.539> like<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.719> lot<00:05:31.960> more

read this is more Brown so I like it I
like<00:05:35.020> both<00:05:35.380> pencils<00:05:35.800> but<00:05:35.949> this<00:05:36.190> one<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:36.400> think

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
like both pencils but this one I think

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.730 
like both pencils but this one I think
is<00:05:36.759> just<00:05:36.909> a<00:05:37.030> better<00:05:37.210> match<00:05:37.509> for<00:05:37.539> me<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.169> is<00:05:38.560> more

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.439 
is just a better match for me it is more
expensive<00:05:38.860> but<00:05:39.639> to<00:05:39.819> me<00:05:39.940> it's<00:05:40.090> worth<00:05:40.240> it

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
expensive but to me it's worth it

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.580 
expensive but to me it's worth it
because<00:05:40.509> I<00:05:40.750> think<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:41.139> it<00:05:41.259> looks<00:05:41.409> better

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590

then<00:05:56.409> I<00:05:56.529> tried<00:05:57.039> I<00:05:57.909> think<00:05:58.479> medium<00:05:58.930> brown<00:05:59.169> or

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
then I tried I think medium brown or

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.600 
then I tried I think medium brown or
something<00:05:59.680> like<00:05:59.740> that<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.069> I<00:06:00.130> thought<00:06:00.340> that

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
something like that and I thought that

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.149 
something like that and I thought that
was<00:06:00.819> the<00:06:00.849> one<00:06:01.150> for<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.449> little<00:06:01.630> bit<00:06:01.840> but<00:06:02.319> it<00:06:02.889> was

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
was the one for a little bit but it was

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.950 
was the one for a little bit but it was
still<00:06:03.430> looking<00:06:03.550> kind<00:06:03.909> of<00:06:03.969> dark<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:04.449> so<00:06:04.750> then<00:06:04.900> I

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
still looking kind of dark and so then I

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.570 
still looking kind of dark and so then I
switched<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.319> caramel<00:06:05.710> kind<00:06:05.979> of<00:06:06.130> just<00:06:06.310> like<00:06:06.430> on

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
switched to caramel kind of just like on

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.820 
switched to caramel kind of just like on
a<00:06:06.610> whim<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.630> think<00:06:07.930> that<00:06:08.080> this<00:06:08.229> one<00:06:08.500> really

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
a whim and I think that this one really

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.529 
a whim and I think that this one really
works<00:06:09.039> for<00:06:09.340> me<00:06:09.430> of<00:06:09.610> course<00:06:09.639> it's<00:06:10.060> kind<00:06:10.270> of<00:06:10.360> hard

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
works for me of course it's kind of hard

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.269 
works for me of course it's kind of hard
to<00:06:10.599> tell<00:06:10.690> for<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.229> guys<00:06:11.469> on<00:06:11.710> camera<00:06:12.130> because

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
to tell for you guys on camera because

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.709 
to tell for you guys on camera because
I've<00:06:12.520> got<00:06:12.699> like<00:06:12.849> the<00:06:12.969> lights<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:13.419> all<00:06:13.509> that

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
I've got like the lights and all that

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.409 
I've got like the lights and all that
but<00:06:14.319> just<00:06:14.560> from<00:06:14.860> what<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.430> guys<00:06:15.580> can<00:06:15.909> see<00:06:16.180> in

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
but just from what you guys can see in

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.600 
but just from what you guys can see in
more<00:06:16.779> recent<00:06:16.990> pictures<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.919> think<00:06:18.340> that<00:06:18.460> this

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
more recent pictures I think that this

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.670 
more recent pictures I think that this
looks<00:06:18.940> better<00:06:19.240> again<00:06:19.900> I<00:06:19.930> think<00:06:20.139> that<00:06:20.440> the<00:06:20.500> brow

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
looks better again I think that the brow

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.439 
looks better again I think that the brow
powder<00:06:20.889> works<00:06:21.130> great<00:06:21.460> for<00:06:21.490> some<00:06:21.819> people<00:06:22.120> just

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
powder works great for some people just

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.219 
powder works great for some people just
for<00:06:22.659> my<00:06:23.310> eyebrows<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:24.699> wasn't<00:06:25.630> working<00:06:25.779> it<00:06:26.080> was

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
for my eyebrows it wasn't working it was

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.480 
for my eyebrows it wasn't working it was
kind<00:06:26.409> of<00:06:26.469> like<00:06:26.620> it<00:06:26.770> would<00:06:26.889> look<00:06:26.979> great<00:06:27.190> when<00:06:27.460> I

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
kind of like it would look great when I

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.490 
kind of like it would look great when I
first<00:06:27.819> did<00:06:28.090> it<00:06:28.150> but<00:06:28.479> then<00:06:28.630> as<00:06:28.840> the<00:06:28.960> day<00:06:29.110> went<00:06:29.380> on

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
first did it but then as the day went on

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.499 
first did it but then as the day went on
it<00:06:29.830> was<00:06:29.889> just<00:06:30.009> making<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.580> powder<00:06:30.820> too<00:06:31.180> dark

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
it was just making the powder too dark

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.320 
it was just making the powder too dark
and<00:06:31.740> just<00:06:32.740> overall<00:06:33.009> I<00:06:33.699> just<00:06:34.000> like<00:06:34.149> the<00:06:34.300> way

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
and just overall I just like the way

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.950 
and just overall I just like the way
this<00:06:34.539> looks

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
this looks

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.379 
this looks
I<00:06:34.990> feel<00:06:35.380> like<00:06:35.590> when<00:06:36.100> I<00:06:36.130> use<00:06:36.520> the<00:06:36.550> brow<00:06:36.880> pencil<00:06:37.330> I

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
I feel like when I use the brow pencil I

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.330 
I feel like when I use the brow pencil I
can<00:06:37.419> actually<00:06:37.720> brush<00:06:38.650> it<00:06:38.860> out<00:06:38.949> with<00:06:39.190> the

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
can actually brush it out with the

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.520 
can actually brush it out with the
little<00:06:39.610> spooley<00:06:40.120> on<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.419> other<00:06:40.539> side<00:06:40.840> and<00:06:41.199> I

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
little spooley on the other side and I

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.290 
little spooley on the other side and I
can<00:06:41.710> actually<00:06:41.860> see<00:06:42.370> like<00:06:42.639> the<00:06:42.759> individual

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
can actually see like the individual

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.050 
can actually see like the individual
hairs<00:06:43.569> now<00:06:43.840> it's<00:06:44.050> not<00:06:44.229> just<00:06:44.470> like<00:06:44.680> a<00:06:45.060> large

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
this also it did not last very long I

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.969 
this also it did not last very long I
would<00:07:02.169> say<00:07:02.349> that<00:07:02.620> this<00:07:02.889> made<00:07:03.280> me<00:07:03.430> lasted<00:07:03.880> me

would say that this made me lasted me

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.089 
would say that this made me lasted me
two<00:07:05.979> months<00:07:06.220> or<00:07:06.669> so<00:07:07.389> maybe<00:07:07.990> not<00:07:08.289> even<00:07:08.320> so

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:09.099 
two months or so maybe not even so

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.589 
two months or so maybe not even so
that's<00:07:09.340> another<00:07:09.789> reason<00:07:09.970> why<00:07:10.120> I<00:07:10.210> got<00:07:10.389> another

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
so much so i definitely recommend this

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.020 
so much so i definitely recommend this
it's<00:07:17.680> like<00:07:17.710> 22<00:07:18.190> bucks<00:07:18.400> which<00:07:18.610> is<00:07:18.639> kind<00:07:18.970> of

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
it's like 22 bucks which is kind of

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.909 
it's like 22 bucks which is kind of
expensive<00:07:19.240> but<00:07:20.050> i<00:07:20.110> think<00:07:20.320> it's<00:07:20.440> totally<00:07:20.740> worth

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 
expensive but i think it's totally worth
