00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
hair quite a few times I've been

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.399 
hair quite a few times I've been
bleached<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:23.909> it's<00:04:24.479> gone<00:04:24.630> really<00:04:24.960> dry<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
brittle and worse so hopefully this will

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.570
