reason<00:00:05.819> why<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:05.970> want<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> check<00:00:06.480> out<00:00:06.569> this

reason why I want to check out this

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.700 
reason why I want to check out this
specific<00:00:07.350> game<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.890> because<00:00:08.929> it's<00:00:09.929> putting

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
specific game is because it's putting

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.459 
specific game is because it's putting
okay<00:00:11.340> graphics<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.599> device<00:00:12.990> has<00:00:13.200> warm

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
okay graphics and this device has warm

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.070 
okay graphics and this device has warm
to<00:00:13.650> hear<00:00:13.769> its<00:00:13.980> dual<00:00:14.219> core<00:00:14.639> processor<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.570> don't

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
to hear its dual core processor I don't

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.870 
to hear its dual core processor I don't
know<00:00:16.170> about<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.560> GPU<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.369> chipset

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
know about the GPU or the chipset

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.849 
know about the GPU or the chipset
because<00:00:18.150> i<00:00:18.270> couldn't<00:00:18.510> found<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.199> nation<00:00:19.770> on

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
because i couldn't found that nation on

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.060 
because i couldn't found that nation on

of<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.200> cheaper<00:00:41.739> Galaxy<00:00:42.340> devices<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.960> there

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
of the cheaper Galaxy devices out there

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.380 
of the cheaper Galaxy devices out there
you<00:00:44.890> can<00:00:45.040> get<00:00:45.129> like<00:00:45.340> five<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:48.190> five<00:00:48.670> four

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
you can get like five for like five four

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.450 
you can get like five for like five four
of<00:00:49.720> these<00:00:49.930> you<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.350> finally<00:00:50.559> get<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.920> galaxy

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
of these you can finally get the galaxy

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.530 
of these you can finally get the galaxy
s5<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:56.320> this<00:00:56.589> game<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:57.940> can<00:00:58.120> change<00:00:58.360> the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
s5 like this game and you can change the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.630 
s5 like this game and you can change the
graphics<00:00:58.960> from<00:00:59.140> what<00:00:59.290> I<00:00:59.320> did<00:00:59.620> see<00:00:59.890> in<00:01:00.400> the

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
graphics from what I did see in the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.670 
graphics from what I did see in the
settings<00:01:01.030> but<00:01:01.900> you<00:01:01.960> can<00:01:02.110> see<00:01:02.230> when<00:01:02.409> you<00:01:02.530> are

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
settings but you can see when you are

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.499 
settings but you can see when you are
alone<00:01:02.769> here<00:01:03.010> in<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.550> front<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:04.149> can<00:01:04.210> play

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
alone here in the front you can play

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.530 
alone here in the front you can play
this<00:01:04.659> game<00:01:04.720> pretty<00:01:05.080> ok<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.390> pretty

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
this game pretty ok which is pretty

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.420 
this game pretty ok which is pretty
interesting<00:01:07.869> but<00:01:08.619> when<00:01:08.830> there<00:01:09.009> are<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> lot<00:01:09.399> of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
interesting but when there are a lot of

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.600 
interesting but when there are a lot of
cars<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.000> they<00:01:10.119> close<00:01:10.450> close<00:01:11.200> up<00:01:11.410> you<00:01:12.399> can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
cars and they close close up you can

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.010 
cars and they close close up you can
kind<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.030> get<00:01:13.149> a<00:01:13.180> slow<00:01:13.450> down<00:01:13.690> on<00:01:13.930> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
kind of get a slow down on the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.980 
kind of get a slow down on the
performance<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.300> can<00:01:16.420> see<00:01:16.570> here<00:01:16.780> when

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
performance but you can see here when

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
performance but you can see here when
I'm<00:01:17.110> all<00:01:17.320> alone<00:01:17.560> it's<00:01:18.070> pretty<00:01:18.369> ok<00:01:18.789> actually

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.090 

this<00:01:25.210> device<00:01:25.509> s<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.020> reforma<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.590> jelly<00:01:26.890> bean

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
this device s and reforma to jelly bean

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.700 
this device s and reforma to jelly bean
and<00:01:27.399> I<00:01:27.580> use<00:01:27.729> installed<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.710> improvements

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
and I use installed a improvements

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.999 
and I use installed a improvements
performance<00:01:30.399> update<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.960> was<00:01:32.140> around<00:01:32.440> 100

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
performance update which was around 100

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.730 
performance update which was around 100
megabytes<00:01:33.429> so<00:01:34.270> maybe<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.690> updated<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.530> nice

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
megabytes so maybe that updated to nice

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.860 
megabytes so maybe that updated to nice
work

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:56.470 

I<00:01:43.930> guess<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.860> pretty<00:01:45.190> okay

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.950 

mom<00:01:57.480> dad

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.230 

and<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.490> memory<00:02:05.909> install

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and there's not that much memory install

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.469 
and there's not that much memory install
or<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> well<00:02:07.049> mostly<00:02:07.440> count<00:02:07.799> down<00:02:08.729> low<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.209> any

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
or a well mostly count down low down any

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:35.420 
or a well mostly count down low down any
single<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:13.220> see<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> got<00:02:14.459> first<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
single game see I got first now you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:58.150 
single game see I got first now you
can't<00:02:35.850> again<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.930> performance

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.380 

it's<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.250> car<00:02:59.550> here<00:03:01.220> pretty<00:03:02.220> nice<00:03:02.400> good<00:03:03.030> stuff

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.480 

yeah<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.510> bet<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.750> enjoyed<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.230> love<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.250> you

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
yeah I bet you enjoyed that love you you

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:18.470 
yeah I bet you enjoyed that love you you
know<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.760> some<00:03:17.940> slow<00:03:18.210> down

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
know so you can see here some slow down

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.920 
know so you can see here some slow down
sometimes<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.850> if<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.150> would<00:03:21.390> play<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> game

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
sometimes and if you would play a game

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.900 
sometimes and if you would play a game
here<00:03:22.200> if<00:03:22.350> proll<00:03:22.590> also<00:03:22.950> would<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.310> maybe<00:03:23.790> a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
here if proll also would be maybe a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.730 
here if proll also would be maybe a
little<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.210> slow<00:03:24.690> down<00:03:24.870> sometimes<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:25.560> yeah

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
little bit slow down sometimes but yeah

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.850 
little bit slow down sometimes but yeah
pretty<00:03:26.460> ok<00:03:26.820> performance<00:03:27.390> overall<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:28.830> a

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
pretty ok performance overall for a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.020 
pretty ok performance overall for a
cheap<00:03:29.280> phone<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:30.000> yeah<00:03:30.450> quick<00:03:30.870> lick
