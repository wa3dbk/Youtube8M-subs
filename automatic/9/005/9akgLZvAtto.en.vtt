this<00:00:15.179> Mike<00:00:15.570> bone<00:00:16.550> is<00:00:17.550> encased<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.439> piece

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this Mike bone is encased in this piece

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
this Mike bone is encased in this piece
that<00:00:20.130> sits<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.119> got<00:00:21.300> four<00:00:22.080> or<00:00:22.260> five

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that sits in there it's got four or five

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.939 
that sits in there it's got four or five
little<00:00:23.220> screws<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.410> now<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.619> take<00:00:25.890> that

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
little screws in it now you take that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.150 
little screws in it now you take that
out<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.609> reveals<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.990> end<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> Mike

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
out and it reveals the end of the Mike

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
out and it reveals the end of the Mike
bone<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.849> wire<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.480> comes<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
bone with this wire that comes out of it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.750 
bone with this wire that comes out of it
well<00:00:31.430> basically<00:00:32.430> there's<00:00:33.059> no<00:00:34.399> anything<00:00:35.399> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
well basically there's no anything in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.389 
well basically there's no anything in
here<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:37.010> make<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:39.770> movement<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.100> Mike

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
here to make the movement of this Mike

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.330 
here to make the movement of this Mike
bone<00:00:43.430> anywhere<00:00:44.430> near<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> should<00:00:45.480> be

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
bone anywhere near what it should be

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.270 
bone anywhere near what it should be
this<00:00:47.850> wire<00:00:48.570> gets<00:00:49.020> pulled<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.980> forth

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
this wire gets pulled back and forth

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
this wire gets pulled back and forth
back<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.610> forth<00:00:50.850> every<00:00:51.329> time<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.140> move<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
back and forth every time you move it in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.029 
back and forth every time you move it in
and<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.280> guess<00:00:54.140> what<00:00:55.140> has<00:00:55.350> happened<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and out and I guess what has happened is

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.720 
and out and I guess what has happened is
somewhere<00:00:57.050> inside<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.640> plastic<00:01:00.480> piece<00:01:01.730> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
somewhere inside this plastic piece the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.450 
somewhere inside this plastic piece the
wire<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.570> broken<00:01:04.159> I<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.460> can

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
wire is broken I know this because I can

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.230 
wire is broken I know this because I can
wiggle<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.290> Mike

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
wiggle it around and I can see the Mike

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
wiggle it around and I can see the Mike
connect<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.450> disconnect<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.170> connect<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
connect and disconnect and connect and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
connect and disconnect and connect and
disconnect<00:01:14.570> through<00:01:15.570> my<00:01:15.720> computer<00:01:17.150> anyway<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
disconnect through my computer anyway I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.100 
disconnect through my computer anyway I
don't<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> home<00:01:21.270> fix<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
don't really see a home fix for this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
don't really see a home fix for this
unless<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.590> replace<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.310> piece<00:01:23.520> all

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
unless you replace the piece all

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.620 
unless you replace the piece all
together<00:01:27.020> yeah<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.619> said<00:01:29.360> six<00:01:30.360> months

breaks<00:01:59.530> but<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.240> guessing<00:02:01.240> will<00:02:01.360> probably<00:02:01.780> the

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
breaks but a guessing will probably the

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.680 
breaks but a guessing will probably the
same<00:02:02.110> problem
