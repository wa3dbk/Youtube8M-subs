00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
store at the us it in-game stop and
since<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.330> same<00:00:24.449> prices<00:00:24.750> by<00:00:25.170> membership

since it's the same prices by membership
normally<00:00:26.460> I'll<00:00:26.970> probably<00:00:27.300> end<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.539> creating

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
normally I'll probably end up creating

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.660 
normally I'll probably end up creating
one<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> does<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.470> quite<00:00:28.800> cool<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
one because it does look quite cool and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
one because it does look quite cool and
so<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> hairstyle

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so what it is is you get the hairstyle

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.680 
so what it is is you get the hairstyle
and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> staff<00:00:32.910> which<00:00:33.239> has<00:00:33.270> four

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and then the staff which has four

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.049 
and then the staff which has four
different<00:00:33.809> forms<00:00:34.290> depending<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.670> magic

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
different forms depending on which magic

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.670 
different forms depending on which magic
level<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> want<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> use<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
level you want to use it at so you can

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
level you want to use it at so you can
switch<00:00:38.070> between<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.059> highest<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
switch between them the highest of the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
switch between them the highest of the
one<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:40.020> 60<00:00:40.500> magic<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.100> 40<00:00:41.879> attack<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.360> wield<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
one is 60 magic and 40 attack to wield I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
one is 60 magic and 40 attack to wield I
believe<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.559> exactly<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> same<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
believe it's exactly the same as a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.729 
believe it's exactly the same as a
battle<00:00:44.730> staff<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.510> even<00:00:46.320> though<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.620> not

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
battle staff so even though it's not

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.490 
battle staff so even though it's not
completely<00:00:47.370> cosmetic<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.379> not

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
completely cosmetic it's a it's not

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.100 
completely cosmetic it's a it's not
really<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> big<00:00:49.980> deal<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.370> mean<00:00:50.610> they've<00:00:50.820> also

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
really a big deal I mean they've also

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
really a big deal I mean they've also
things<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> barbed<00:00:52.590> bow<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.579> are

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
things like the barbed bow which are

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.819 
things like the barbed bow which are
pretty<00:00:54.449> much<00:00:54.600> useless<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.170> terms<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.500> combat

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
pretty much useless in terms of combat

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.819 
pretty much useless in terms of combat
it's<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> looks<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.620> has

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it's more just for the looks so it has

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.650 
it's more just for the looks so it has
the<00:00:59.100> four<00:00:59.340> different<00:00:59.489> forms<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the four different forms and then it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
the four different forms and then it
also<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> right-click<00:01:01.350> emote<00:01:01.920> option

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
also has a right-click emote option

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.020 
also has a right-click emote option
which<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.719> opinion<00:01:03.840> looks<00:01:04.170> quite<00:01:04.619> cool

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
which in my opinion looks quite cool

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.859 
which in my opinion looks quite cool
definitely<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.340> yeah<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.479> careful

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
definitely and yeah so just be careful

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
definitely and yeah so just be careful

a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.350> bit<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.680> he<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.490> really

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a little bit if he I don't really

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
a little bit if he I don't really
understand<00:01:18.030> why<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.299> don't<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.689> add<00:01:19.049> these

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
understand why they don't just add these

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
understand why they don't just add these
things<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> people<00:01:20.250> who<00:01:20.400> pay<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.700> credit

it shows the lighting through other help
headgear<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.630> any<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> hair<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.619> showing

randomly<00:01:58.049> he<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.350> messing<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.710> his<00:01:59.630> with

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
randomly he was messing with his with

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.050 
randomly he was messing with his with
his<00:02:00.750> stuff<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> psalm<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> customization

his stuff in the psalm and customization

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.590 
his stuff in the psalm and customization
thing<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:03.990> appeared<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.560> his<00:02:04.710> head

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
so that's a little bit odd but yeah it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.250 
so that's a little bit odd but yeah it
seems<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.910> pretty<00:02:12.030> clearly<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
seems like it's pretty clearly a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
seems like it's pretty clearly a
Facebook<00:02:13.560> promotional<00:02:14.040> things<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.459> they'll
