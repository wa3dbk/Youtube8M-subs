quite a bit if you have full signal like

quite a bit if you have full signal like

there's<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:27.739> some<00:02:27.950> latency<00:02:28.280> issues

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
there's going to be some latency issues

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.640 
there's going to be some latency issues
if<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.360> was<00:02:29.450> connected<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.900> say<00:02:30.110> my<00:02:30.260> macbook

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
if it was connected to say my macbook

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.310 
if it was connected to say my macbook
pro<00:02:30.890> through<00:02:31.280> USB<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:32.120> would<00:02:32.239> be<00:02:32.420> much<00:02:32.989> quicker

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
pro through USB it would be much quicker

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.370 
pro through USB it would be much quicker
and<00:02:33.530> much<00:02:34.190> lower<00:02:34.370> latency<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.140> I'm<00:02:36.230> not

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
and much lower latency so but I'm not

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.110 
and much lower latency so but I'm not
going<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.890> put<00:02:37.040> my<00:02:37.160> macbook<00:02:37.489> pro<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:37.910> on<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
treadmill around the bike alright that's

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.090 
treadmill around the bike alright that's
taking<00:02:41.780> forever<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.230> mean<00:02:42.500> let's<00:02:42.800> try<00:02:43.040> this

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
taking forever I mean let's try this

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.480 
taking forever I mean let's try this
then<00:02:43.489> let's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
then let's

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.950 
then let's

that hooked up pretty quick let's give

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.309 
that hooked up pretty quick let's give
it<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.769> second<00:03:31.220> there<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.030> let's<00:03:32.959> start<00:03:33.170> on

it a second there and let's start on

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.380 
it a second there and let's start on
netflix<00:03:33.799> see<00:03:34.010> if<00:03:34.129> it<00:03:34.280> sees<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.760> nope<00:03:35.180> not<00:03:35.480> yet

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
netflix see if it sees it nope not yet

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.830 
netflix see if it sees it nope not yet
make<00:03:37.870> sure<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.200> connected<00:03:39.660> there<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.750> is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
make sure it's connected there it is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.510 
make sure it's connected there it is
Thanks<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.500> few<00:03:41.680> seconds<00:03:42.010> against<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> it's

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
Thanks a few seconds against it it's

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.660 
Thanks a few seconds against it it's
over<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:43.569> cell<00:03:43.810> network<00:03:43.840> now<00:03:44.500> let's<00:03:44.740> try<00:03:45.010> with

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
over the cell network now let's try with

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.260 
over the cell network now let's try with
that<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.209> see<00:03:46.330> how<00:03:46.420> much<00:03:46.510> faster<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:47.020> might<00:03:47.260> be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
that and see how much faster it might be

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.730 
that and see how much faster it might be
see<00:03:49.270> if<00:03:49.330> we<00:03:49.450> even<00:03:49.510> have<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> successful<00:03:50.170> test<00:03:50.560> at

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
see if we even have a successful test at

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.290 
see if we even have a successful test at
all<00:03:50.860> with<00:03:51.069> this<00:03:51.250> oh<00:03:52.950> there<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.040> go<00:03:54.070> it's<00:03:54.550> came

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
all with this oh there we go it's came

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.150 
all with this oh there we go it's came
up<00:03:55.450> really<00:03:55.750> quick<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:56.770> let's<00:03:58.500> play<00:03:59.500> star<00:03:59.860> trek

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
up really quick so let's play star trek

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.790 
up really quick so let's play star trek
now<00:04:00.520> that's<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.790> lot<00:04:01.270> faster<00:04:01.690> than<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> evo<00:04:02.230> and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
now that's a lot faster than the evo and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.890 
now that's a lot faster than the evo and
this<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.400> off<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.760> next<00:04:03.940> one<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.810> the

the hotspot function you can't do that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.000 
the hotspot function you can't do that
with<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.430> evo<00:04:21.700> because<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.500> cdma<00:04:23.500> and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
with the evo because it's a cdma and

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.220 
with the evo because it's a cdma and
here<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.640> it's<00:04:25.510> playing<00:04:25.990> over<00:04:26.140> my

that's really nice so at least that

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.300 
that's really nice so at least that
works<00:05:10.640> on<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.740> proves<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.040> nexus

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310
