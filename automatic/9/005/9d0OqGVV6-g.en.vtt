00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.390
 Yonejimazaki Dojo also 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.480
 45 minutes 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.299
 It is a certain page 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.429
 Cover the lower eight 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.759
 Mr. Fujimori 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.739
 It's simple and easy 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.739
 wuxga 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.330
 We received a fair presentation, but we will do our best to make music 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.339
 There 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.529
 It is said that it brings one story 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.759
 In the heart 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.980
 If it is a story, play along with the story 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.960
 I can not do it 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 So only one in the story 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.590
 We went 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.590
 Everyone is stuck with Goba 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.100
 First of all 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.710
 It's nothing new 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.710
 In vain 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.160
 Then surprise 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.710
 It is to be surprised 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.970
 Then observe 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.970
 Observe that man 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.390
 Anxiety next 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.900
 Little intention 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.420
 Well there is a negative factor, but it is called anxiety 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.070
 prediction 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.670
 A little light comes out from the bottom in the hope 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.670
 Eventually it became a pleasure 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.440
 Nobuaki Net 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.400
 I will go back 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.630
 What kind of thing is it? 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 Become easier 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.120
 Excuse me 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.910
 In addition, we are training that it is a place of birth temporarily 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.660
 That latest 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.000
 I mean 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.350
 Do not leave 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.679
 Yes, not from each other's life 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.330
 It is love at first sight that deserves surprise 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.640
 I will 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.750
 It is that the person is entering slowly after the end 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.680
 The words are bad, but you are observing now 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.820
 Anxiety that you will have your own behavior next 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.210
 I'm worried about each other 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.299
 Talk it in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.580
 It's like each other by grabbing a little chance 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.999
 It is not likely to wind 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.369
 It is 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.589
 Be happy to do 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.589
 Marathon representative who gets married 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.559
 There is no theme or even sports 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.629
 The low price of cherry salmon 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.439
 I am watching a game 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.619
 The mountain is full of excitement 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.439
 Gladly 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.869
 I will try it from now on 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.889
 Hull discovery 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.029
 The final 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.619
 Become an observation 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.789
 Destabilization for resolutions 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 I said that I thought it was not as I thought 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:53.229
 Then I do development work and eventually fulfill my job 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.349
 As it is 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.369
 It is the most seasoning now 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.589
 So Calbee's 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.699
 I think you all know well so just some of it 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.309
 I will return while pulling 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.709
 I can not do it 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.399
 Asada is full 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:13.820
 Upper payment 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.879
 Muroran 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.529
 First of all 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:22.239
 It is not a surprise to take over and say something from inside 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.019
 Vodka 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.750
 Observe it slowly on it yeah 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.349
 Figure 1 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:43.059
 Although it is it, the theory which neither the year nor the left understands 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.569
 Anam 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.170
 If you give such a story, in combination of about m 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.779
 It is going to change 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.939
 I think I will die 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.699
 Did not do such a thing 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.019
 Apply 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:02.870
 New
