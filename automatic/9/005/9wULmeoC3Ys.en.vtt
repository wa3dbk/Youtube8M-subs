00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
all it is to keep it simple is they

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.099

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
this new one has a fifth creatine so

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.509

each one of the different creatine say

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.910 
each one of the different creatine say
that<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:47.879> takes<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.239> different<00:00:48.390> pathway<00:00:49.079> into

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that it takes a different pathway into

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.119 
that it takes a different pathway into
your<00:00:50.039> cells<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.199> they<00:00:52.199> added<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> fifth<00:00:52.920> one

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
