00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that in the rebound we make it 2-1 so we

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650

because<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.590> didn't<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.070> create<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
because we didn't really create that

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.910 
because we didn't really create that
many<00:01:26.790> chances<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.509> yeah<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.290> lost<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.530> game<00:01:28.650> we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
decided to switch to default cows club

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
decided to switch to default cows club
because<00:01:42.420> yeah<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.229> place<00:01:43.470> were<00:01:43.649> quite

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
because yeah the other place were quite

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.590 
because yeah the other place were quite
low<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.220> fitness<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.850> decided<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> play<00:01:45.420> with

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600

low and fitness I decided to play with
this<00:01:45.720> team<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.470> hopefully<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.189> either

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399

stay<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.780> Division<00:02:55.409> two<00:02:55.439> so<00:02:55.889> hopefully<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.459> can

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
stay in Division two so hopefully we can

shot on goal but his goalkeeper is there
to<00:04:42.180> save<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:42.840> we<00:04:43.020> draw<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.290> game<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
to save it so we draw the game in the

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.620 
to save it so we draw the game in the
antenna<00:04:44.250> my<00:04:44.370> opinion<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.910> was<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> fair<00:04:45.419> result

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
antenna my opinion it was a fair result

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.360 
antenna my opinion it was a fair result
because<00:04:46.080> we<00:04:46.260> both<00:04:46.410> had<00:04:46.650> eight<00:04:46.830> shots<00:04:46.889> on

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
because we both had eight shots on

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.790 
because we both had eight shots on
target<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:48.030> yeah<00:04:48.720> draw<00:04:49.050> would<00:04:49.230> have<00:04:49.350> been<00:04:49.530> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
target so yeah draw would have been the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.409 
target so yeah draw would have been the
best<00:04:49.950> result<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.490> my<00:04:50.639> opinion<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.240> we're

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
best result in my opinion so we're

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.210 
best result in my opinion so we're
moving<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.139> I<00:04:52.260> decided<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.710> play<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.040> last

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220
