Chilliwack lake and the lake we're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.120 
Chilliwack lake and the lake we're
looking<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.050> right<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.260> is<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.620> Lindemann

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
lake and the one we're going to is
called<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> green<00:01:34.350> drop<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:35.940> a<00:01:36.000> few

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
called a green drop I think it's a few

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
called a green drop I think it's a few
more<00:01:36.270> kilometers<00:01:36.480> in<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.620> this<00:01:37.800> Lake<00:01:37.980> had<00:01:38.190> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
more kilometers in but this Lake had a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.560 
more kilometers in but this Lake had a
lot<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.550> people<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:38.940> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.300> other<00:01:39.330> end

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
lot of people actually on the other end

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
lot of people actually on the other end
so<00:01:39.930> we're<00:01:40.080> gonna<00:01:40.200> keep<00:01:40.500> moving<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.670> camp<00:01:42.030> at

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so we're gonna keep moving and camp at

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
so we're gonna keep moving and camp at
the<00:01:42.330> other<00:01:42.480> lake<00:01:42.720> which<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.680> think<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:43.980> be

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the other lake which I think will be

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.860 
the other lake which I think will be
more<00:01:44.280> rewarding<00:01:44.460> people<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.480> told<00:01:45.570> us<00:01:45.690> it's

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.550 
more rewarding people have told us it's

fallen
God<00:03:56.790> knows<00:03:56.970> went<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.480> long<00:03:57.690> time<00:03:57.959> ago<00:03:58.170> that's

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
God knows went a long time ago that's

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.600 
God knows went a long time ago that's
for<00:03:58.800> sure<00:03:59.120> but<00:04:00.120> that's<00:04:00.690> pretty<00:04:00.900> cool<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:02.010> BC

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
for sure but that's pretty cool and BC

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.369 
for sure but that's pretty cool and BC
we've<00:04:02.790> got<00:04:02.940> some<00:04:03.150> massive<00:04:03.600> trees

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.509 

but<00:04:10.379> this<00:04:10.500> general<00:04:10.860> area<00:04:11.159> that<00:04:11.219> we're<00:04:11.430> in

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
but this general area that we're in

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.190 
but this general area that we're in
right<00:04:11.549> now<00:04:11.819> it's<00:04:12.150> kind<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.540> isolated<00:04:12.959> away

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
right now it's kind of isolated away

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.509 
right now it's kind of isolated away
from<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.469> other<00:04:13.590> campsites<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.340> that's

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
from the other campsites so that's

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.170 
from the other campsites so that's
pretty<00:04:14.730> sweet

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
pretty sweet

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.870 
pretty sweet
the<00:04:15.719> downside<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:17.220> know<00:04:17.310> not<00:04:17.489> as<00:04:17.639> good<00:04:17.789> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
the downside is you know not as good of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.129 
the downside is you know not as good of
a<00:04:17.940> view<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.299> lake<00:04:18.449> for<00:04:18.720> sure

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
a view of the lake for sure

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.020 
a view of the lake for sure
but<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.250> literally<00:04:20.459> walk<00:04:20.669> down<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.910> the

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
but you can literally walk down to the

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.080 
but you can literally walk down to the
water<00:04:21.239> right<00:04:21.449> over<00:04:21.630> there<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:22.940> see<00:04:23.940> that

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
water right over there I see that

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.450 
water right over there I see that
there's<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.330> lot<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.690> fires<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.460> there's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
there's a lot of fires here there's

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.040 
there's a lot of fires here there's
actually<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.820> fire<00:04:27.120> band<00:04:27.389> in<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.720> backcountry

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
actually a fire band in the backcountry

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.050 
actually a fire band in the backcountry
but<00:04:28.889> it<00:04:28.979> seems<00:04:29.160> like<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.340> lot<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.580> people<00:04:29.789> kind

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
but it seems like a lot of people kind

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.840 
but it seems like a lot of people kind
of<00:04:30.150> ignore<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:31.400> I've<00:04:32.400> got<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.639> say<00:04:32.729> it's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
of ignore that I've got to say it's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.370 
of ignore that I've got to say it's
pretty<00:04:33.000> tempting<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.930> make<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> fire

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
pretty tempting to to make a fire

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.600 
pretty tempting to to make a fire
because<00:04:34.590> that's<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.130> best<00:04:35.280> parts<00:04:35.550> of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
because that's one of the best parts of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.600 
because that's one of the best parts of
camping<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.350> don't<00:04:37.979> know<00:04:38.039> I<00:04:38.250> think<00:04:38.520> we'll

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
camping but I don't know I think we'll

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.850 
camping but I don't know I think we'll
probably<00:04:38.789> end<00:04:38.940> up<00:04:39.090> respecting<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.690> ban<00:04:39.860> it's

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
probably end up respecting the ban it's

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.170 
probably end up respecting the ban it's
been<00:04:41.009> a<00:04:41.039> long<00:04:41.190> day<00:04:41.370> anyways<00:04:41.729> and<00:04:41.940> we<00:04:42.000> probably

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
been a long day anyways and we probably

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.189 
been a long day anyways and we probably
don't<00:04:42.330> want<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.599> make<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> fire

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199
