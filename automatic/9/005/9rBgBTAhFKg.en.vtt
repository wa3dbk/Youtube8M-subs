00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 throughout history we thought that 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.730
 Spectrum appeared only in the third part 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.480
 but it looks like he was just hiding 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.509
 waited and studied us but some child 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.230
 either still noticed him so we can 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.230
 to see him 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.240
 all beaver dear friends you remember 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640
 this one here is a picture they are many more 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.070
 they said it was an image 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.290
 springtrap five nights at freddy's one 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.180
 I was done well 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.059
 I had to disassemble a lot of pictures 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.070
 however, it was decided that this is 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.000
 the picture is actually a picture 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.190
 springtrap 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.290
 there in the description will be a reference to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.059
 pictures that inspired me to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.980
 this job 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.290
 it is known from Scott's interview that Scott is 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.010
 development time fnaf1 didn't plan 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.290
 create 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.650
 the next part he thought that this game 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.049
 it will be his last however as can be seen from 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 many easter eggs he conceived many 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.549
 characters which realized in 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.280
 the following parts of this one 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.900
 puppet you presence can be determined 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 by pictures on the wall on which 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.070
 depicts a crying child who has become 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.049
 puppet 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.210
 but now it looks like itâ€™s like 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.490
 marionette then planned and 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.799
 springtrap but let's go to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.359
 evidence at the beginning carefully 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.299
 look at the picture that us 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.520
 depicted on the upper right we see that 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.429
 this picture is a continuation of that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
 most pictures for which supposedly 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.640
 Springtrap pictured 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 so let's get it compatible and see 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.319
 what will come of it immediately display 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.929
 straight lines that reflect the similarity 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.229
 springtrap of this figure we see that 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:53.380
 eyes mouth ears are located on one 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.990
 line truth is the only thing that is not visible 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.569
 such ascol as springtrap 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.520
 By the way pay more attention to 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.600
 one animatronica which is a little lower 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.810
 of our drawing 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.659
 he is also very similar to this springtrap 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.670
 it looks like even color so do children 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.000
 drew several different drawings 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.100
 This 1 animatronic perhaps but let's 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.260
 continue to dig the only thing that you 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.250
 I'll tell you now pay attention to him 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 ears 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.990
 ears are at different angles now 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150
 look at the background that we have in 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.980
 office and waiting for us to turn on it 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.050
 Attention 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.799
 let me mark that we should in it 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.650
 notice his ears his ears are located under 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.540
 right angle so it does not coincide with 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 the very picture that was drawn 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.500
 on the wall 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.690
 let's compare with springtrap I think 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.950
 all seeing that their ears are located in 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.739
 different sides 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.430
 so what does that really mean 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.780
 baths and springtrap are not related and it is possible 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.540
 what we thought before 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.480
 that springtrap is older 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.610
 version of the bath is wrong because if 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.010
 would they be so then they 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.730
 performed in the same way 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.879
 as well as the example happened with the fight from 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.609
 fnaf 2 and also baths from fnaf 1 which 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.069
 are older for each other 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.720
 and a newer version okay now we 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.640
 We are not talking about this at all. 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.950
 compare better with a picture and which 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.590
 we have in the hall we see what 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.760
 the direction and angle of the ears coincides with 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.859
 springtrap and this is a weighty guess 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.650
 especially considering that for 1 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.410
 2 parts of Kuban ears are always directed 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.690
 straight up and here in the picture and in 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.780
 springtrap in different directions 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.109
 but this is not all yet let's see 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.859
 on the shape of the head body ok let's 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.540
 now compare it with the head on the pictures 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.609
 You can see quite well in the bathhouse which 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.799
 represented in the game head more 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.000
 angular while while in drawing y 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.120
 his head 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.940
 even and round let's compare with 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.910
 springtrap I think itâ€™s clear that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.560
 drawing head more coincides with the head 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.650
 springtrap than rank 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.379
 This is another proof in the piggy bank 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.780
 this theory well and unfortunately the last 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.970
 what do dear friends hope you 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.700
 enough of these arguments because 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.229
 they seemed to me enough 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.389
 entertaining subscribe to new 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.280
 video leave your comments write 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.979
 your opinion about this theory and we 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.370
 See you in the next series for now. 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.130
 until 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.160
 where 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.160
