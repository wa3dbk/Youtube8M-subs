alright<00:00:02.460> so<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.210> actually<00:00:03.480> part<00:00:03.990> two<00:00:04.350> in

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
alright so this is actually part two in

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.160 
alright so this is actually part two in
laying<00:00:05.490> out<00:00:05.640> UVs<00:00:06.089> on<00:00:06.240> polygon<00:00:06.600> objects<00:00:07.080> and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
laying out UVs on polygon objects and

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.839 
laying out UVs on polygon objects and
the<00:00:07.319> first<00:00:07.529> part<00:00:07.799> actually<00:00:08.040> just<00:00:08.460> showed<00:00:08.670> you

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the first part actually just showed you

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.240 
the first part actually just showed you
how<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.830> projections<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
how to do the projections to get the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.549 
how to do the projections to get the
movies<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.940> then<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
movies and then this one I'm going to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.320 
movies and then this one I'm going to
show<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.799> some<00:00:14.099> things<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.700> inside

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
show you some things you can do inside

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.120 
show you some things you can do inside
of<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.719> UV<00:00:16.080> texture<00:00:16.470> editor<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
of this UV texture editor here to

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.740 
of this UV texture editor here to
improve<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> layout<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> ubs<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.420> relax

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
improve the layout of the ubs and relax

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.480 
improve the layout of the ubs and relax
them<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.350> they<00:00:22.590> appear<00:00:22.890> more<00:00:23.039> square<00:00:23.369> on

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
them so that they appear more square on

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.060 
them so that they appear more square on
the<00:00:23.580> surface<00:00:23.910> anyway<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> perspective

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the surface anyway so in the perspective

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.679 
the surface anyway so in the perspective
view<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.910> shaded<00:00:27.480> view

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
view here you can see I'm in shaded view

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.070 
view here you can see I'm in shaded view
i<00:00:28.130> turn<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.369> text<00:00:29.730> review<00:00:30.000> something<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.840> didn't

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
i turn my text review something I didn't

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
i turn my text review something I didn't
explain<00:00:31.320> last<00:00:31.619> time<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
explain last time as you see this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.850 
explain last time as you see this
transparent<00:00:33.270> looking<00:00:33.710> material<00:00:34.710> looks

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
transparent looking material looks

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
transparent looking material looks
transparent<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.329> means<00:00:36.480> there's<00:00:36.690> no<00:00:36.750> UVs

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
transparent it just means there's no UVs

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.959 
transparent it just means there's no UVs
a<00:00:37.680> side<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.250> part<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> polygon

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
a side of that part of the polygon

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.410 
a side of that part of the polygon
object<00:00:39.090> yet<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.239> doesn't<00:00:42.239> have

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
object yet so really it doesn't have

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.760 
object yet so really it doesn't have
anything<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> show<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> material<00:00:43.649> yet

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
anything to show the material yet

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.900 
anything to show the material yet
because<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> UV<00:00:44.340> czar<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.760> shows

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because the UV czar how it shows

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.440 
because the UV czar how it shows
textures<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:47.070> shaded<00:00:47.820> view<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.270> showing

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
textures and shaded view is just showing

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
textures and shaded view is just showing
the<00:00:48.660> base<00:00:48.780> material<00:00:49.020> we're<00:00:49.920> looking<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the base material we're looking at a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
the base material we're looking at a
texture<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.879> though<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:54.050> we<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.170> quite

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
texture do though now and we have quite

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.970 
texture do though now and we have quite
a<00:00:55.530> few<00:00:55.649> scenes<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:57.109> here<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
a few scenes here here here where the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
a few scenes here here here where the
patterns<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.760> disrupted<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.600> if

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
patterns just really disrupted and if

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.139 
patterns just really disrupted and if
you<00:01:00.809> had<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> Photoshop<00:01:01.500> image<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.309> going

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you had a Photoshop image on there going

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
you had a Photoshop image on there going
across<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.650> line

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
across you would actually see that line

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.179 
across you would actually see that line
cutting<00:01:05.400> into<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> urine<00:01:06.390> texturing<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
cutting into the urine texturing and it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
cutting into the urine texturing and it
would<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.580> nasty<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.960> went<00:01:10.049> over

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
would look really nasty so we went over

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.510 
would look really nasty so we went over
this<00:01:10.380> before<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.250> map<00:01:11.490> these

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this before and I just map these

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.600 
this before and I just map these
sections<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> you'll<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:14.250> select

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
sections and you'll see how I can select

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.999 
sections and you'll see how I can select
a<00:01:14.909> section<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> shell<00:01:16.290> hold<00:01:16.830> down

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
a section here go to shell hold down

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.120 
a section here go to shell hold down
control<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:18.150> mouse<00:01:18.330> button<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
control right mouse button and it's just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
control right mouse button and it's just
that<00:01:20.340> shell<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.390> map<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.049> did<00:01:22.320> one

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that shell that one map I did one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
that shell that one map I did one
projection<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.960> our<00:01:26.180> big<00:01:27.180> shells

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
projection and we have our big shells

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.670 
projection and we have our big shells
here<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> do

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
here and so and so so what we want to do

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.819 
here and so and so so what we want to do
is<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.600> maybe<00:01:34.020> refresh<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> little

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
is I'm going to maybe refresh a little

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.600 
is I'm going to maybe refresh a little
we<00:01:37.829> want<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.340> UM<00:01:39.619> just<00:01:40.619> select<00:01:40.860> these<00:01:41.159> edges

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
we want to UM just select these edges

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.289 
we want to UM just select these edges
and<00:01:43.100> I'm<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> zoom<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.180> can

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and I'm going to zoom in here so we can

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.470 
and I'm going to zoom in here so we can
see<00:01:45.540> what's<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> little

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.430 

select<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.600> edges<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:55.990> want<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.260> sew

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
select the edges you want to sew

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.560 
select the edges you want to sew
together<00:01:57.000> you'll<00:01:58.000> notice<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.360> it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
together you'll notice that it's

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.570 
together you'll notice that it's
selecting<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.350> edges<00:01:59.740> on<00:01:59.920> the<00:01:59.950> other<00:02:00.220> show

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
selecting the edges on the other show

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:14.120 
selecting the edges on the other show
that<00:02:02.970> basically<00:02:03.970> match<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:12.030> video<00:02:13.030> card<00:02:13.390> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
that basically match I video card is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.000 
that basically match I video card is
capture<00:02:15.130> rain<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.490> killing<00:02:15.700> me<00:02:15.940> here<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.680> once

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
capture rain is killing me here so once

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.680 
capture rain is killing me here so once
there<00:02:21.540> what's<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:22.720> selected<00:02:23.290> polygons

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
there what's all selected polygons

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.120 
there what's all selected polygons
moving<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.200> edges<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:26.739> can<00:02:26.890> look<00:02:26.980> at

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
moving so you the edges we can look at

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.360 
moving so you the edges we can look at
the<00:02:27.220> options<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.290> don't<00:02:29.890> ever<00:02:30.160> mess

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the options but really I don't ever mess

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.229 
the options but really I don't ever mess
these<00:02:30.550> options<00:02:31.350> moving<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.770> we<00:02:33.670> just<00:02:33.820> limited

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
these options moving so we just limited

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.699 
these options moving so we just limited
that<00:02:34.390> scene<00:02:34.660> at<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.810> bottom<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.380> see<00:02:35.410> them<00:02:35.650> at

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
that scene at the bottom you see them at

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.540 
that scene at the bottom you see them at
the<00:02:35.800> bottom<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:37.620> we'll<00:02:38.620> work<00:02:38.770> our<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.100> now

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
the bottom and we'll work our way up now

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.370 
the bottom and we'll work our way up now
an<00:02:40.120> easier<00:02:40.420> way<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.570> do<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:40.900> if<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.170> want<00:02:41.350> to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
an easier way to do this if I want to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.010 
an easier way to do this if I want to
select<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.920> whole<00:02:42.190> lung<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:45.070> whole<00:02:45.280> edge

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
select this whole lung this whole edge

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.300 
select this whole lung this whole edge
without<00:02:47.020> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.530> shift<00:02:47.770> selecting

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
without going to shift selecting

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.670 
without going to shift selecting
everyone<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.730> can<00:02:48.970> hold<00:02:49.120> down<00:02:49.150> control<00:02:49.680> rice

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
everyone I can hold down control rice

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.229 
everyone I can hold down control rice
mat<00:02:50.980> right<00:02:51.160> mouse<00:02:51.340> button<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.030> edge<00:02:52.690> Lee<00:02:54.239> and

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
mat right mouse button to edge Lee and

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.940 
mat right mouse button to edge Lee and
we'll<00:02:55.420> select<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.840> entire<00:02:55.959> loop<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.770> edge

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
we'll select the entire loop that edge

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.940 
we'll select the entire loop that edge
flows<00:02:57.280> through<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.239> I'll<00:02:59.110> move<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.709> you've

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
flows through and I'll move in so you've

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.130 
flows through and I'll move in so you've
easy<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.790> you'll<00:03:01.209> notice<00:03:01.510> how<00:03:01.660> they<00:03:01.810> update

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
easy and you'll notice how they update

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.020 
easy and you'll notice how they update
here<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.680> window<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.400> they<00:03:03.610> even<00:03:04.120> out

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
here in this window and they even out

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.199 
here in this window and they even out
the<00:03:07.030> idea<00:03:07.239> here<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:11.220> oz<00:03:12.220> video<00:03:12.700> captures

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
the idea here is to oz video captures

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.860 
the idea here is to oz video captures
killing<00:03:13.540> me<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:16.030> idea<00:03:16.420> here<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.600> least

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
killing me the idea here is to the least

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.259 
killing me the idea here is to the least
amount<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.230> seems<00:03:20.470> possible<00:03:20.739> now<00:03:21.640> i'm<00:03:21.820> at<00:03:22.030> my

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
amount of seems possible now i'm at my

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.009 
amount of seems possible now i'm at my
shells<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:22.930> shifted<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.440> little<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.870> i'm

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
shells have shifted a little so i'm

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.690 
shells have shifted a little so i'm
going<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.230> select<00:03:26.410> these<00:03:26.739> two<00:03:26.799> things<00:03:27.220> i'm

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
going to select these two things i'm

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.380 
going to select these two things i'm
just<00:03:27.910> going<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.180> because<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.260> want<00:03:29.500> them

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
just going to because you want them

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.740 
just going to because you want them
relatively<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.640> really<00:03:33.940> good<00:03:34.120> position<00:03:34.360> to

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
relatively in a really good position to

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.229 
relatively in a really good position to
line<00:03:35.140> up<00:03:35.380> really<00:03:35.620> well<00:03:35.860> before<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.030> do<00:03:37.209> your

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
line up really well before you do your

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.720 
line up really well before you do your
moving<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.070> there's<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.400> least

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
moving so so that there's the least

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.280 
moving so so that there's the least
amount<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.269> distortion<00:03:42.870> when<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.959> move<00:03:44.140> in

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
amount of distortion when you move in

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.240 
amount of distortion when you move in
cell<00:03:46.200> there's<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.290> least<00:03:47.500> amount<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.860> moving

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
cell there's a least amount of moving

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.930 
cell there's a least amount of moving
going<00:03:48.549> on<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.930> what<00:03:50.049> i'm<00:03:50.140> going<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.350> do<00:03:50.500> is

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
going on so what i'm going to do is

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.309 
going on so what i'm going to do is
select<00:03:51.940> yeah<00:03:52.209> j'ellooo

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
select yeah j'ellooo

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.509 
select yeah j'ellooo
see<00:03:55.319> that's<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> work<00:03:55.860> right<00:03:56.040> I'm<00:03:56.219> gonna<00:03:56.340> have

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
see that's it work right I'm gonna have

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:05.860 
see that's it work right I'm gonna have
to<00:03:56.610> manually<00:04:01.790> manually<00:04:02.790> select<00:04:03.120> these<00:04:03.239> edges

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.309 

we're<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.079> sew<00:04:08.989> all<00:04:09.989> those<00:04:10.349> moving<00:04:10.859> so

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
we're going to sew all those moving so

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.689 
we're going to sew all those moving so
you<00:04:13.319> just<00:04:13.500> saw<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.799> update<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.220> window<00:04:14.519> if<00:04:15.269> not

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
you just saw it update the window if not

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.110 
you just saw it update the window if not
alone<00:04:18.769> let's<00:04:19.769> see<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.039> happens<00:04:20.430> here<00:04:20.549> as<00:04:20.910> in

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
alone let's see what happens here as in

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.060 
alone let's see what happens here as in
Tampa<00:04:23.990> okay<00:04:24.990> we'll<00:04:25.199> zoom<00:04:25.229> in<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.860> an<00:04:25.979> idea

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
Tampa okay we'll zoom in to get an idea

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.110 
Tampa okay we'll zoom in to get an idea
what's<00:04:26.490> going<00:04:26.759> on<00:04:26.880> with<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:28.699> all<00:04:29.699> right<00:04:29.910> well

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
what's going on with that all right well

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.820 
what's going on with that all right well
right<00:04:30.449> now<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:30.690> can<00:04:30.990> see<00:04:31.199> where<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:31.530> cutting

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
right now you can see where it's cutting

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.920 
right now you can see where it's cutting
off<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.250> squares<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:33.060> it's<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.389> seam<00:04:33.660> they

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
off the squares and it's a seam they

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.779 
off the squares and it's a seam they
don't<00:04:34.110> meet<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.220> pattern<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.639> different

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
don't meet so the pattern is different

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.490 
don't meet so the pattern is different
he<00:04:36.599> also<00:04:36.720> happens<00:04:37.229> when<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.440> moving<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:39.500> they've

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
he also happens when I moving so they've

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.779 
he also happens when I moving so they've
all<00:04:40.650> shifted<00:04:41.070> into<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> right<00:04:41.430> pattern<00:04:44.449> now

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
all shifted into the right pattern now

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.779 
all shifted into the right pattern now
okay<00:04:47.789> another<00:04:48.419> thing<00:04:48.570> too<00:04:48.990> is<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:50.340> select<00:04:50.639> on

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
okay another thing too is you select on

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.370 
okay another thing too is you select on
your<00:04:50.910> object<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.479> perspective<00:04:52.050> window

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
your object in the perspective window

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.189 
your object in the perspective window
you<00:04:52.770> might<00:04:52.800> maximize<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.639> screen<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:57.139> go<00:04:58.139> to

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
you might maximize the screen and go to

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.189 
you might maximize the screen and go to
the<00:04:58.349> attributes<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.970> material<00:05:00.570> that's<00:05:00.960> on

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
the attributes of the material that's on

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.620 
the attributes of the material that's on
it<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.560> go<00:05:01.860> under<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.159> tab<00:05:02.479> there's<00:05:03.479> the

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
it and go under the tab there's the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.620 
it and go under the tab there's the
color<00:05:03.900> all<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.530> go<00:05:04.830> down<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.220> bottom

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
color all this go down to the bottom

hardware<00:05:06.630> texturing<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:08.250> can<00:05:08.400> go<00:05:08.550> under

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
hardware texturing and you can go under

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.120 
hardware texturing and you can go under
texture<00:05:10.139> resolution<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:13.500> it'll<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:13.740> really

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
texture resolution and it'll just really

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.420 
texture resolution and it'll just really
show<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.610> more<00:05:14.940> crisp<00:05:15.860> like<00:05:16.860> you'll<00:05:17.070> see<00:05:17.310> when

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
show it more crisp like you'll see when

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.089 
show it more crisp like you'll see when
them<00:05:18.830> low<00:05:19.830> 32<00:05:21.349> so<00:05:22.349> if<00:05:22.470> they<00:05:22.620> look<00:05:22.770> kind<00:05:23.039> of

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
them low 32 so if they look kind of

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.580 
them low 32 so if they look kind of
blurry<00:05:23.340> like<00:05:23.699> this<00:05:23.940> in<00:05:24.270> strange<00:05:25.080> on<00:05:25.470> your

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
blurry like this in strange on your

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.200 
blurry like this in strange on your
monitor<00:05:26.039> just<00:05:26.460> make<00:05:26.610> sure<00:05:26.639> they're<00:05:26.970> at<00:05:27.090> the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
monitor just make sure they're at the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.110 
monitor just make sure they're at the
highest<00:05:27.570> high<00:05:27.840> as<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.169> can<00:05:28.289> go<00:05:28.349> is<00:05:28.590> 256<00:05:29.280> I'm

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
highest high as it can go is 256 I'm

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.399 
highest high as it can go is 256 I'm
going<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.330> keep<00:05:30.449> it<00:05:30.570> on<00:05:30.659> default<00:05:31.080> from<00:05:31.229> right

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
going to keep it on default from right

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:39.890 
going to keep it on default from right
now<00:05:34.190> ok<00:05:36.409> so<00:05:38.000> what<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.180> other<00:05:39.479> things<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:39.780> was

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
now ok so what the other things I was

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.110 
now ok so what the other things I was
going<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.110> talk<00:05:40.260> about<00:05:40.409> is<00:05:40.740> is<00:05:41.039> so<00:05:41.940> we're

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
going to talk about is is so we're

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.060 
going to talk about is is so we're
trying<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.479> keep<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.780> square<00:05:43.260> and<00:05:43.289> uniform

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
trying to keep the square and uniform

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.700 
trying to keep the square and uniform
and<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.280> some<00:05:44.490> places<00:05:44.610> they<00:05:45.000> are<00:05:45.180> going<00:05:45.419> to

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
and in some places they are going to

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.240 
and in some places they are going to
kind<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.800> stretch<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.460> little<00:05:47.900> what<00:05:48.900> not<00:05:49.139> and<00:05:49.440> so

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
kind of stretch a little what not and so

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.430 
kind of stretch a little what not and so
you'll<00:05:50.460> see<00:05:50.550> actually<00:05:51.240> over<00:05:51.570> here<00:05:51.930> by<00:05:52.380> the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
you'll see actually over here by the

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.980 
you'll see actually over here by the
edge<00:05:52.680> of<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.949> chest<00:05:53.509> right<00:05:54.509> here<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.870> this

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
edge of the chest right here in this

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.649 
edge of the chest right here in this
corner<00:05:55.370> they<00:05:56.370> are<00:05:56.639> I<00:05:57.030> mean<00:05:57.180> if<00:05:57.300> we<00:05:57.419> map<00:05:57.630> the

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
corner they are I mean if we map the

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.270 
corner they are I mean if we map the
Restless<00:05:58.199> and<00:05:58.229> sewed<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:58.770> in<00:05:58.889> they<00:05:59.039> probably

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
Restless and sewed it in they probably

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.680 
Restless and sewed it in they probably
even<00:05:59.400> out<00:05:59.699> but<00:05:59.880> they're<00:06:00.000> distorted<00:06:00.509> right

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
even out but they're distorted right

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.990 
even out but they're distorted right
here<00:06:00.960> we<00:06:01.710> can<00:06:01.889> fix<00:06:02.159> some<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.669> little<00:06:02.849> bit

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
here we can fix some of the little bit

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.530 
here we can fix some of the little bit
of<00:06:03.120> distortion<00:06:03.450> like<00:06:03.900> that

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
of distortion like that

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.640 
of distortion like that
you're<00:06:06.540> going<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.750> want<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:06.990> go<00:06:07.140> into<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.470> UV

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
you're going to want to go into the UV

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.880 
you're going to want to go into the UV
texture<00:06:07.980> editor<00:06:09.080> let's<00:06:10.080> get<00:06:10.290> it<00:06:10.380> lined<00:06:10.530> up<00:06:10.710> so

texture editor let's get it lined up so

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.480 
texture editor let's get it lined up so
we<00:06:10.980> can<00:06:11.130> see<00:06:11.340> where<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.550> distorted<00:06:12.030> spa<00:06:12.240> days
