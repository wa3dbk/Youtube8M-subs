00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
package on its own now let's just say

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.770 
package on its own now let's just say
you<00:05:10.070> decided<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.730> have<00:05:10.850> pear<00:05:11.180> juice<00:05:11.510> instead

you decided to have pear juice instead
our<00:05:12.350> apple<00:05:13.040> juice<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.670> even<00:05:13.850> juiced<00:05:14.270> it

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
our apple juice and you even juiced it

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.330 
our apple juice and you even juiced it
well<00:05:15.110> first<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.530> all<00:05:15.650> you're<00:05:15.830> gonna<00:05:15.890> have<00:05:16.010> to

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
well first of all you're gonna have to

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.460 
well first of all you're gonna have to
juice<00:05:16.640> about<00:05:17.030> ten<00:05:17.360> times<00:05:17.570> that<00:05:17.900> amount<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.350> get

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
juice about ten times that amount to get

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.030 
juice about ten times that amount to get
a<00:05:18.530> small<00:05:19.360> sampling<00:05:20.360> of<00:05:20.390> juice<00:05:20.750> that's<00:05:21.230> gonna

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
a small sampling of juice that's gonna

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.010 
a small sampling of juice that's gonna
fit<00:05:22.340> not<00:05:22.640> even<00:05:22.910> fill<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.210> up<00:05:23.240> really<00:05:23.720> and

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
fit not even fill you up really and

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.040 
fit not even fill you up really and
basically<00:05:24.920> what<00:05:25.520> happens<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:26.150> it's<00:05:26.660> one<00:05:26.930> of

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
basically what happens is it's one of

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.840 
basically what happens is it's one of
jacks<00:05:27.320> up<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.680> blood<00:05:27.920> sugar<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.490> then<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.730> can

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
jacks up the blood sugar and then it can

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.340 
jacks up the blood sugar and then it can
come<00:05:29.060> plummeting<00:05:29.660> down<00:05:29.690> if<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.170> don't

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
come plummeting down if you don't

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.900 
come plummeting down if you don't
incorporate<00:05:30.620> some<00:05:31.130> other<00:05:31.250> things<00:05:31.640> with<00:05:31.880> that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
incorporate some other things with that

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.110 
incorporate some other things with that
like<00:05:32.390> I<00:05:32.630> don't<00:05:32.840> know<00:05:33.200> greens<00:05:33.730> this<00:05:34.730> is<00:05:34.910> why<00:05:35.090> I

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
like I don't know greens this is why I

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.410 
like I don't know greens this is why I
like<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.360> smoothie<00:05:36.080> instead<00:05:36.500> really<00:05:36.770> because

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
like a smoothie instead really because

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.000 
like a smoothie instead really because
it<00:05:38.420> balances<00:05:39.140> because<00:05:39.320> you<00:05:39.590> still<00:05:39.830> have<00:05:39.980> the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
it balances because you still have the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.190 
it balances because you still have the
fiber<00:05:40.400> but<00:05:41.090> you're<00:05:41.270> able<00:05:41.660> to<00:05:41.690> blend<00:05:42.050> in

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
fiber but you're able to blend in

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.500 
fiber but you're able to blend in
agreeance<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.100> perfect<00:05:43.400> existence<00:05:44.300> of

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
agreeance it is the perfect existence of

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.840 
agreeance it is the perfect existence of
fruit<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:44.990> greens<00:05:45.260> all<00:05:45.980> in<00:05:46.310> one<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.640> green

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
smoothie but when you're on the go and

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.340 
smoothie but when you're on the go and
you<00:05:48.620> can't<00:05:48.920> do<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:50.840> know<00:05:50.930> I<00:05:50.960> could

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
you can't do that you know I could

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.710 
you can't do that you know I could
really<00:05:51.620> if<00:05:52.040> it's<00:05:52.280> cool<00:05:52.640> or<00:05:53.000> it's<00:05:53.180> mild

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
really if it's cool or it's mild

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.690 
really if it's cool or it's mild

ourself off the hook when ultimately we

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.140 
ourself off the hook when ultimately we
