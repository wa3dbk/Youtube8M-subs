 Let's introduce any of you there. 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 to see that the course here really is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.600
 who is starting today is have to talk 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.160
 something is, above all, the work that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.920
 we are developing for you that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 came there with my channel was to be a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.350
 few of these students know what they have 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.289
 to talk because you too are motivated 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 We're talking to an eduardo. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.090
 loaded this group is watching the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.090
 people go out at last kaboul confer 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 think he was the driver 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.840
 I learned to learn, we are not here. 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 also the dae like rafael the fame of gay 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.190
 to go through this group there as is the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 interesting scheme theory in practice is 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.940
 Then he not watching there not only 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.260
 than working better 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.380
 let's go to the bajaki something and like the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.490
 name plus ipod some is very good 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.300
 very good and you really know it's good to catch 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 here navigate in the direction of the angle 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.940
 heavy the heavy car to know what it is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.540
 he is very go is learning is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:47.600
 learning'm even here I do not even care 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 I knew I knew the category since then. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.780
 He said it begins our'll have to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 working with a new rule is france 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.680
 work with a new one and do everything else 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.530
 How are we going to show you photos? 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:07.620
 They were all that have patience to teach 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.450
 and learn to rely on traffic there 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.730
 so this course here is very good to see 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.600
 You just have to win very differently. 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.950
 because here is a bit the swine staff and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.140
 this one was the only one that voted yesterday 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.590
 Rio means a good message over there. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.360
 The group that is seeing us there is good because 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.790
 treatment teaches us as a 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.260
 true driver is patient not like 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.160
 those ordinary drivers that we see 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.780
 around and driving, how do I work? 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.640
 as a driver suffering much more from the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.549
 that I thought I knew 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.070
 say there is very different and our right 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.350
 and our friend the open vote is the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.120
 roberto roberto and it already goes in search 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.610
 also with this fear not having 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.820
 knowledge qualification that I thought 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.800
 that happened but there were 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.990
 Improved work the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.630
 out of space to pole get advice 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.910
 to everyone who comes first 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.040
 It's worth it in this huge and acting 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.410
 doing here because I do not know this here 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.720
 that is not sold to us all, why not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.710
 I just thought I'd leave the line 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.180
 do not learn anymore 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:18.180
 and so do I in legislation but in the 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.550
 practice on Saturday that the qualification 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.140
 technical team in practice and also 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.550
 so you there that you still need 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.740
 who is a professional who is to be a 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.660
 qualified professional in the 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.220
 work I do not have more time here alone 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.500
 had you been divided right? 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.680
 showing me that you watch me and now it's 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.660
 getting and enjoying the whole 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.010
 knowledge that is necessary for the 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.640
 people have a differential in the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.290
 job 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.200
 So I hope you guys see us soon. 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.420
 there take advantage of a promotion and it's ending 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.610
 or is running out and we will lose 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.010
 promotion, then it makes contact with 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.140
 the lady is driving with or entered 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.860
 in contact with the lÃ­lian secretary there 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.380
 behind 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.630
 The biggest problem here to know is already 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.550
 line 10 talk to her will schedule and 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:06.810

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:09.209
 UN 3265 or else 4307 34 27 54 00 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.440
