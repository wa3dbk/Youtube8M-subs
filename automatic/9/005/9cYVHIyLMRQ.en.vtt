00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.750
 without knowing it we were very far 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.720
 the comfort of our home 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.790
 suddenly the car we were traveling in 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.280
 stopped in the middle of two stations of the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.280
 line of courts and nine 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.180
 We were hundreds 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.500
 we were standing 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.030
 ghost that we all imagine 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.030
 in first person 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.940
 more people walked through life the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.079
 first in the north direction returned to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.079
 the courts station 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.940
 but then we saw how dozens of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.769
 passengers took the opposite direction 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.769
 that confused us even more 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.799
 had to wait about ten minutes until 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.260
 that one of us activated the mechanism 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.310
 of emergency and manually opened the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.270
 doors 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.270
 10 minutes underground is a long time 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 the passengers helped each other 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.000
 others to come down from the formations 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.850
 the first ones had jumped us 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.960
 we had more luck someone found the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.960
 emergency stairs 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.020
 only then did the tour begin 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.880
 the tracks we still did not know how much we 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.910
 it was about to walk in that territory 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.060
 inhospitable full of cables and half 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.060
 light 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.860
 there is only one for him 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.170
 we covered about 30 meters without having very 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.930
 clear how we would get out of there suddenly 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.460
 the tracks were divided and we took for a 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.460
 smaller tunnel 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.010
 the march stopped the tunnel was 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 full 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.960
 in all stations at the end of each 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.750
 platform there is a ladder that links this with 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.880
 the tracks and we went up 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.920
 leave behind that moment that we had 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.500
 preferred not to live 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.840
 the mouth of the subway a few meters from 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.330
 Obelisk ambulances awaited us 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.670
 police and fire trucks 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.670
 the worst had been left behind 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.400
 good to see this exodus impressive 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.910
 Luciana was there there were people 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.440
 large there were pregnant people and guys 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.990
 the one who suffers that austro phobia that 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.070
 tremendous 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.070
 frightful they said in the chronicle
