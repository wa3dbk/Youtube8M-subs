for an air rifle especially for spring

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.680 
for an air rifle especially for spring
now<00:03:55.340> you've<00:03:56.340> got<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> lot<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.640> PCP<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.269> out<00:03:57.510> there

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
now you've got a lot of PCP is out there

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.270 
now you've got a lot of PCP is out there
in<00:03:57.750> 25<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.120> this<00:04:00.120> thing<00:04:00.480> it's<00:04:00.690> producing<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
in 25 and this thing it's producing the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.080 
in 25 and this thing it's producing the
same<00:04:02.549> foot-pounds<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.269> energy

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
same foot-pounds of energy

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.940 
same foot-pounds of energy
same<00:04:05.659> speed<00:04:06.140> ft/s<00:04:07.099> as<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.480> lot<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.840> PCPs<00:04:09.620> in

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
same speed ft/s as a lot of the PCPs in

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.280 
same speed ft/s as a lot of the PCPs in
the<00:04:10.040> same<00:04:10.250> caliber<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.659> you<00:04:11.720> get<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.930> for<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.110> lot

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the same caliber so you get it for a lot

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.250 
the same caliber so you get it for a lot
cheaper<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> weapon<00:04:14.780> here<00:04:15.049> that

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
cheaper so this is a weapon here that

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.319 
cheaper so this is a weapon here that
for<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.680> larger<00:04:16.340> bombers<00:04:16.699> coming<00:04:16.850> around<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270 
squirrels one you can take pigeons we
take<00:04:27.020> about<00:04:27.199> everything<00:04:27.620> with<00:04:27.740> it

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
take about everything with it

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.280 
take about everything with it
thing<00:04:28.820> is<00:04:28.970> though<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.540> heavy<00:04:29.840> weights

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
thing is though it is heavy weights

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.020 
thing is though it is heavy weights
about<00:04:30.500> nine<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:31.070> half<00:04:31.190> pounds

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
about nine and a half pounds

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.150 
about nine and a half pounds
I<00:04:32.060> think<00:04:32.930> after<00:04:33.229> put<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.470> scope<00:04:33.680> on<00:04:33.860> will<00:04:34.040> be

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
I think after put the scope on will be

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.629 
I think after put the scope on will be
probably<00:04:34.550> closer<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.940> 11<00:04:35.510> pounds<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:37.220> you've

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
probably closer to 11 pounds so you've

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.860 
probably closer to 11 pounds so you've
got<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:37.970> eat<00:04:38.060> your<00:04:38.210> Wheaties<00:04:38.360> if<00:04:38.660> you're<00:04:38.780> going

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.740 
got to eat your Wheaties if you're going
to<00:04:38.960> have<00:04:39.080> this<00:04:39.260> one<00:04:39.500> those<00:04:40.070> people<00:04:40.430> out<00:04:40.580> here

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
to have this one those people out here
