00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.099
 in ancient Rome and the ancient 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.610
 Egypt they used artificial eyes of 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 clay painted in the 16th century in europe 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.160
 they began to be made of enameled gold 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.100
 and shortly after glass that was what 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.749
 usual for hundreds of years today the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 Most artificial eyes are 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.109
 acrylics 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.990
 [Music] 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.509
 If you lose an eye in an accident or 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 a disease a specialist called 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.360
 ocular ista can provide you with an eye 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.860
 artificial can opt for a model 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.629
 or prefabricated prosthesis as 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.990
 like the one you're placing on this 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.210
 patient 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.190
 the eye sockets are different 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 in each person that's why the first step 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.690
 is to make a mold after inserting the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.910
 impression mold is injected a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.970
 stuff called alginate that you fill 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.130
 the entire eye socket in 90 seconds the 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.150
 Alginate dries and can be removed 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.540
 the impression 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.240
 and the impression is placed in a mold and 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 a kind of plaster is poured 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 Y 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.790
 what remains in the mold is a replica 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 of the gypsum basin 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.160
 then jones jones to a little 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.350
 Acrylic in the mold gets the mold in 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.480
 a press and it dives for 25 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 minutes in a high-speed drying machine 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.060
 pressure after the mold is cooled in 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060
 cold water 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.240
 i 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.830
 this is the original impression compared 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.190
 with acrylic model just 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.190
 be created 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.789
 This model is called adjustment model 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.079
 because it is used to adjust and mark the 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.079
 false iris position 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.080
 marks are accentuated and a 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.570
 peg with a drop of wax the plug 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.229
 indicates the natural angle of the iris when 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.360
 the patient looks forward after 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 wax is added perimeter to 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.470
 enlarge the adjustment model 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 this leftover material will match the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.790
 eyepiece for the final finish 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.250
 the next step is to take the model of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.930
 fit and make a cast of plaster 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.660
 then that mold will be used to make the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.990
 artificial eye 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.540
 but first make the iris 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.820
 takes a curved black acrylic disk and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.610
 paint as realistically as possible with 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.200
 high quality paints the patient 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.430
 must be present so that the color 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 matches the one in the other eye 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.790
 then an acrylic cornea is stuck with 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 the pupil of the appropriate size in the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.080
 iris painted at this time the iris 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.510
 artificial is 13 mm in diameter if the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.250
 Real iris is smaller patient is 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.860
 reduces the size of the replica so that 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.900
 match the iris goes to the mold of 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.970
 plaster where it is covered with a dough 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.890
 white acrylic after the same 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.310
 High pressure drying process 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.800
 before 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.300
 the artificial eye covered with 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.300
 excess acrylic material 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.160
 the excess material and the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.190
 peg using a polisher and a 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.040
 blade this polishes the shape and leaves the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.810
 seen the iris that is below equals 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.550
 the surface with a grindstone and 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.650
 verify the measurements 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.170
 [Music] 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.299
 with colored pencils the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.730
 last touches to the iris and are drawn 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.250
 the veins 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.380
 [Music] 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.660
 the eye is labeled with the initials of 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.310
 patient and an acrylic bath is applied 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.310
 to seal the pencil marks 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.150
 to create veins with a certain dimension 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.650
 the technicians use the same acrylic bath 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.650
 to stick some silk threads 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.459
 [Music] 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.010
 once satisfied with the eye 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.669
 artificial is sealed the artwork with 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.709
 another acrylic bath when it dries is 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.709
 Brings out shine with a cotton wheel 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.000
 and the shapes and colors of the eyes 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.350
 artificial are innumerable since 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.420
 Basins and irises vary 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.840
 enormously like the white of 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.840
 the eyes 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.400
 this artificial eye or ocular prosthesis already 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.500
 ready 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.050
 The next step is to verify that 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.610
 perfectly fits the muscles 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.830
 patient's eyepieces join the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.720
 implant so that your artificial eye will 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.720
 move in unison with your real eye 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.640
