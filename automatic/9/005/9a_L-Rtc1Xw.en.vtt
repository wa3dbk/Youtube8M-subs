00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
it's a little bit different looking you

can<00:00:38.620> see<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.920> right<00:00:39.010> away<00:00:39.070> from<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.550> just

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
can see it right away from the just

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.250 
can see it right away from the just
looking<00:00:40.000> at<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.149> front<00:00:40.360> panel<00:00:40.510> of<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:40.960> does

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
looking at the front panel of it it does

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260 
looking at the front panel of it it does
use<00:00:41.440> new<00:00:41.649> generation<00:00:42.190> service<00:00:42.550> mount<00:00:42.760> LEDs

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
use new generation service mount LEDs

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.389 
use new generation service mount LEDs
that<00:00:44.079> are<00:00:44.440> actually<00:00:44.530> able<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.860> output<00:00:45.129> four

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
that are actually able to output four

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.069 
that are actually able to output four
times<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.850> power<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.420> traditional<00:00:46.929> one

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
times the power of the traditional one

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.200 
times the power of the traditional one
by<00:00:47.199> one<00:00:47.410> we'll<00:00:48.249> start<00:00:48.429> really<00:00:48.640> well<00:00:48.820> for<00:00:48.969> us<00:00:49.030> in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
by one we'll start really well for us in

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
by one we'll start really well for us in
the<00:00:49.239> situation<00:00:49.719> because<00:00:49.870> as<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.079> can<00:00:50.109> imagine

Center but this one light here has been

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.259 
Center but this one light here has been
enough<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:54.010> power<00:00:54.280> through<00:00:54.999> this<00:00:55.089> whole

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269

well<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.550> back<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:09.940> there's<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.210> module

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
well in the back of it there's a module

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.120 
well in the back of it there's a module
you<00:01:10.659> know<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.870> can't<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.140> chat<00:01:11.320> dmx<00:01:11.710> unit<00:01:11.979> so

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
you know you can't a chat dmx unit so

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.710 
you know you can't a chat dmx unit so
currently<00:01:12.430> we<00:01:12.550> have<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.729> DMX<00:01:13.120> unit<00:01:13.360> attached

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
currently we have the DMX unit attached

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.080 
currently we have the DMX unit attached
when<00:01:14.380> that's<00:01:14.590> attached<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.610> actually<00:01:15.790> have

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
when that's attached you actually have

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.350 
when that's attached you actually have
the<00:01:16.300> ability<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.040> switch<00:01:18.040> internally<00:01:18.880> from

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
the ability to switch internally from

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.490 
the ability to switch internally from
basically<00:01:19.810> what<00:01:19.930> they<00:01:20.020> call<00:01:20.140> high<00:01:20.320> output

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
basically what they call high output

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.370 
basically what they call high output
mode<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.689> standard<00:01:22.689> output<00:01:22.869> mode<00:01:23.110> which

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
mode to a standard output mode which

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.410 
mode to a standard output mode which
dictates<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.369> fan<00:01:24.610> speed<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:25.060> know<00:01:25.119> when<00:01:25.329> you

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
dictates the fan speed you know when you

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.850 
dictates the fan speed you know when you
have<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.570> fan<00:01:25.869> speed<00:01:26.110> running<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.469> full<00:01:26.619> blast

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
have a fan speed running a full blast

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100 
have a fan speed running a full blast
you<00:01:27.460> can<00:01:27.610> get<00:01:27.700> four<00:01:27.909> times<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.240> power<00:01:28.390> when

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
you can get four times the power when

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.330 
you can get four times the power when
you<00:01:29.200> don't<00:01:29.380> have<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.649> fans<00:01:29.829> running<00:01:30.070> again

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
you don't have the fans running again

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.679 
you don't have the fans running again
about<00:01:30.430> twice<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.729> amount<00:01:30.909> of<00:01:31.060> power<00:01:31.180> still<00:01:31.509> of

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
about twice the amount of power still of

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.999 
about twice the amount of power still of
the<00:01:31.780> old<00:01:31.960> one<00:01:32.110> by<00:01:32.229> one<00:01:32.409> switch<00:01:32.619> is<00:01:32.740> kind<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:32.950> a

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
the old one by one switch is kind of a

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.859 
the old one by one switch is kind of a
great<00:01:33.130> feature<00:01:33.340> dimmer<00:01:34.149> in<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.360> back<00:01:34.509> for

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
put it in a grid somewhere and had to go

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.870 
put it in a grid somewhere and had to go
real<00:02:07.689> silence<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.710> use<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> DMX<00:02:09.310> fader<00:02:09.490> drop

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
real silence you use a DMX fader drop

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.520 
real silence you use a DMX fader drop
the<00:02:10.030> fan<00:02:10.210> speed<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.509> basically<00:02:10.780> zero<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.380> uses

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the fan speed to basically zero it uses

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.780 
the fan speed to basically zero it uses
what<00:02:11.740> they<00:02:11.830> call<00:02:11.950> passive<00:02:12.160> cooling<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.640> just

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
what they call passive cooling to just

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.480 
what they call passive cooling to just
keep<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:14.530> know<00:02:14.620> use<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.070> heat<00:02:15.190> sinks<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
keep it you know use the heat sinks to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.310 
keep it you know use the heat sinks to
keep<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> cool<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.690> again<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.020> still<00:02:17.140> get

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
keep it cool and again you still get

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.720 
keep it cool and again you still get
