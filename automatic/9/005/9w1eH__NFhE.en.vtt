but I thought I would share it with you
guys<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.740> I'm<00:02:34.890> going<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.070> quickly<00:02:35.340> go<00:02:36.210> over

it<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.020> quickly<00:02:37.350> discuss<00:02:37.890> what<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.220> says

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
it and just quickly discuss what it says

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.040 
it and just quickly discuss what it says

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and so the following text read Gears of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.930 
and so the following text read Gears of
War<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.380> Xbox<00:02:43.830> one<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.580> be<00:02:44.790> a

War on the Xbox one is going to be a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.090 
War on the Xbox one is going to be a
prequel<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.930> ver<00:02:46.050> may<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.320> getting<00:02:46.650> another

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100

Gears<00:02:49.560> war<00:02:49.770> from<00:02:49.950> now<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.490> definitely<00:02:50.910> be

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
Gears war from now on will definitely be

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.699 
Gears war from now on will definitely be
a<00:02:51.030> prequel<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.720> Gears<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.470> War<00:02:52.530> 3

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
a prequel because Gears of War 3

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.530 
a prequel because Gears of War 3
finished<00:02:53.370> off<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.760> storyline<00:02:54.300> with<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
finished off the storyline with the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.510 
finished off the storyline with the
locust<00:02:54.930> being<00:02:55.170> defeated<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.100> don't<00:02:56.280> think

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
locust being defeated and I don't think

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.790 
locust being defeated and I don't think
there<00:02:56.700> should<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.850> any<00:02:56.970> story<00:02:57.510> after<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.900> so

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
there should be any story after that so

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.500 
there should be any story after that so
the<00:02:59.010> next<00:02:59.160> game<00:02:59.489> will<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.790> going<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.330> going
