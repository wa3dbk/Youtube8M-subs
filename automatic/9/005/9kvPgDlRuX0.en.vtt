00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.780 
when I swipe down when my device is off
it<00:01:41.880> will<00:01:42.090> launch<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.540> app<00:01:42.659> store<00:01:42.960> app<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> we

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it will launch the app store app so we

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.370 
it will launch the app store app so we
also<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.270> windscreen<00:01:46.020> his<00:01:46.170> own

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
also have some windscreen his own

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
also have some windscreen his own
options<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.100> double<00:01:47.430> tap<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.850> unlock<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
options so double tap will unlock on the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
options so double tap will unlock on the
home<00:01:48.689> screen<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> lock<00:01:49.680> screen<00:01:49.950> that's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
home screen or on the lock screen that's
good<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.880> both<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> those<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> then

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
good we want both of those on and then

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
good we want both of those on and then
there's<00:01:52.409> smart<00:01:52.740> touch<00:01:53.009> detection<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
there's smart touch detection so if it's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
there's smart touch detection so if it's
in<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.720> pocket<00:01:54.960> obviously<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> iPad

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
in your pocket obviously with the iPad

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
in your pocket obviously with the iPad
probably<00:01:56.490> doesn't<00:01:56.700> apply<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.420> if

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
probably doesn't apply as much but if

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.870 
probably doesn't apply as much but if
it's<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.750> phone<00:01:58.049> it'll<00:01:58.590> it'll<00:01:58.920> smartly<00:01:59.670> know

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it's your phone it'll it'll smartly know

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's your phone it'll it'll smartly know
whether<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> genuine<00:02:01.200> DoubleTap

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
whether or not it's a genuine DoubleTap

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440 
whether or not it's a genuine DoubleTap
and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.250> there's<00:02:02.399> prevent<00:02:02.850> idle<00:02:03.180> sleep

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and then there's prevent idle sleep

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.410 
and then there's prevent idle sleep
which<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:03.930> turn<00:02:04.409> off<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> digitizer<00:02:05.420> after

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
which will turn off the digitizer after

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
which will turn off the digitizer after
2<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> 3<00:02:06.869> minutes<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.829> disable<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.610> here

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
2 to 3 minutes if you disable that here

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.420 
2 to 3 minutes if you disable that here
so<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.929> obviously<00:02:10.310> render<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
so that will obviously render this

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.740 
so that will obviously render this

altogether<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.180> that's<00:02:25.360> good<00:02:25.600> if<00:02:25.720> you're

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.620 
really concerned about battery life
battery<00:02:27.340> shouldn't<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> huge<00:02:28.330> deal

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
battery shouldn't be a huge deal

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.870 
battery shouldn't be a huge deal
according<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> developer<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.400> obviously

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
according to the developer but obviously

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880 
according to the developer but obviously
there<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.209> going<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.510> some<00:02:31.900> impact<00:02:32.470> that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
there is going to be some impact that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.010 
there is going to be some impact that
having<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.190> digitizer<00:02:33.700> always<00:02:34.180> running<00:02:34.510> so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
having that digitizer always running so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.660 
having that digitizer always running so
the<00:02:35.290> double<00:02:35.530> tap<00:02:35.709> gesture<00:02:36.100> works<00:02:36.310> as<00:02:36.520> you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
the double tap gesture works as you

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.000 
the double tap gesture works as you
would<00:02:36.790> expect<00:02:36.880> double<00:02:37.630> tap<00:02:37.810> turns<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> off<00:02:38.410> now

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
would expect double tap turns it off now

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.160 
would expect double tap turns it off now
swipe<00:02:39.430> down<00:02:39.760> gesture<00:02:40.300> should<00:02:40.570> launch<00:02:40.959> an

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
swipe down gesture should launch an

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.750 
swipe down gesture should launch an
