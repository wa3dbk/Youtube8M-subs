roll<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.559> turn<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.040> bit<00:00:44.340> real

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
roll up and just turn a little bit real

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.080 
roll up and just turn a little bit real
slow<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.649> kind<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> feel

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of the ramp pick a little speed up and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.900 
of the ramp pick a little speed up and
then<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> pump<00:00:51.350> what<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> pump<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> where

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
then you pump what a pump is is where

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.569 
then you pump what a pump is is where
you<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> bend<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.289> knees<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:56.430> your

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you kind of bend your knees and use your

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
you kind of bend your knees and use your
body<00:00:56.760> weight<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> transition

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
body weight to come down the transition

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
body weight to come down the transition
of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> ramp<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> bottom<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.940> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
of the ramp which is the bottom of the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.020 
of the ramp which is the bottom of the
ramp<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.770> first<00:01:02.010> basic<00:01:02.489> thing<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.879> need

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
ramp now the first basic thing you need

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020 
ramp now the first basic thing you need
to<00:01:03.180> learn<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.899> doing<00:01:04.229> BMX<00:01:04.799> freestyle<00:01:05.309> will

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to learn when doing BMX freestyle will

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.500 
to learn when doing BMX freestyle will
be<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> 180<00:01:06.780> well<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> 180<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.030> exactly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
be the 180 well what a 180 is is exactly

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.910 
be the 180 well what a 180 is is exactly
what<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> sounds<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> take

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
what it sounds like it's when you take

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.000 
what it sounds like it's when you take
your<00:01:11.100> body<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.119> bike<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> rotate<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> 180

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
your body and the bike and rotate it 180

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730 
your body and the bike and rotate it 180
degrees<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.470> come<00:01:16.710> up

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
degrees so what you do is you come up

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.030 
degrees so what you do is you come up
and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> turn<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> bike<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.350> land<00:01:19.799> back

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and then you turn the bike and land back

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.289 
and then you turn the bike and land back
down<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.229> in<00:01:22.229> order<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:24.030> come<00:01:24.270> up

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
down and in order to do that you come up

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
down and in order to do that you come up
just<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.380> were<00:01:25.500> doing

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
just kind of like you were doing

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.240 
just kind of like you were doing
get<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.330> speed<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.100> then<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
get your little speed and then you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.080 
get your little speed and then you
bunnyhop<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.150> turn<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> same<00:01:31.380> time<00:01:32.090> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
bunnyhop and turn at the same time and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.640 
bunnyhop and turn at the same time and
then<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.240> pump<00:01:36.650> more

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
then the more you do it and pump more

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.429 
then the more you do it and pump more
momentum<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:39.900> faster

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
momentum you get then you can get faster

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
momentum you get then you can get faster
and<00:01:40.920> faster<00:01:42.979> now<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.250> bunnyhop<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.030> those<00:01:45.180> who

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and faster now a bunnyhop for those who

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
and faster now a bunnyhop for those who
don't<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.049> where<00:01:46.409> you're<00:01:46.530> actually<00:01:46.710> on

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
don't know is where you're actually on

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
don't know is where you're actually on
flat<00:01:48.000> ground<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.659> no<00:01:48.899> ramp<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.439> transition

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
flat ground with no ramp or transition

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.990 
flat ground with no ramp or transition
and<00:01:50.250> lift<00:01:50.790> both<00:01:51.000> tires<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.729> just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and lift both tires up so you just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.999 
and lift both tires up so you just
practice<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.820> by<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> rolling<00:01:57.829> pick<00:01:58.829> up

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
practice that by just rolling pick up

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.010 
practice that by just rolling pick up
your<00:01:59.159> front<00:01:59.340> wheel<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.180> pick<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.479> both<00:02:00.750> up

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
your front wheel you can pick up both up

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
your front wheel you can pick up both up
and<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.280> go

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and there you go

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.999 
and there you go
that's<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.880> bunny<00:02:03.119> hop<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.560> next<00:02:04.860> thing

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that's a bunny hop and the next thing

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
that's a bunny hop and the next thing
you're<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> learn<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.820> far<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.360> riding

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you're going to learn as far as riding

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.660 
you're going to learn as far as riding
vert<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.350> mini<00:02:07.590> ramps<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.190> anything<00:02:08.399> along

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
vert or mini ramps or anything along

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.900 
vert or mini ramps or anything along
those<00:02:09.030> lines<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.780> how<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> roll<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:11.610> first

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
those lines is how to roll in now first

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
those lines is how to roll in now first
what<00:02:12.150> you're<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> want<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.720> do<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.080> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
what you're going to want to do is this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380 
what you're going to want to do is this
which<00:02:14.010> way<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> roll<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:15.030> either

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
which way you want to roll in either

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.320 
which way you want to roll in either
this<00:02:15.870> direction<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.370> other<00:02:17.400> direction<00:02:17.850> so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
this direction or the other direction so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.199 
this direction or the other direction so
what<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.020> do<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.130> look<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:21.000> which

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
what you do is you look and see which

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.110 
what you do is you look and see which
pedal<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.780> ride<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.290> front<00:02:22.709> if<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.670> ride<00:02:23.910> your

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
pedal you ride in front if you ride your

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480 
pedal you ride in front if you ride your
left<00:02:24.390> pedal<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.870> front<00:02:25.170> you're<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> want

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
left pedal in front you're going to want

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.940 
left pedal in front you're going to want
to<00:02:26.610> drop<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.330> opposite<00:02:27.810> side<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.860> you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
to drop in to the opposite side if you

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220 
to drop in to the opposite side if you
ride<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.370> right<00:02:29.610> pedal<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.060> front<00:02:30.360> vice

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
ride your right pedal in front vice

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.460 
ride your right pedal in front vice
versa<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.580> basically<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.870> do<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.080> you

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
versa so basically what you do is you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.309 
versa so basically what you do is you
get<00:02:34.620> rolling<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.900> you're<00:02:36.900> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> pick

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
get rolling and you're going to pick

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.590 
get rolling and you're going to pick
your<00:02:37.350> front<00:02:37.739> wheel<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:39.150> when<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.450> pick

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
your front wheel up now when you pick

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.960 
your front wheel up now when you pick
your<00:02:39.660> front<00:02:40.050> wheel<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.670> kind<00:02:41.850> of

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
your front wheel up you just kind of

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.120 
your front wheel up you just kind of
lift<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.360> over<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.810> metal<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.410> here<00:02:43.680> this

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
lift it over this metal right here this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.670 
lift it over this metal right here this
is<00:02:44.190> called<00:02:44.550> coping<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> use

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
is called coping this is what you use

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.310 
is called coping this is what you use
grinds<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.400> stuff<00:02:47.640> for<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.170> get

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
grinds and stuff for for when you get

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.870 
grinds and stuff for for when you get
your<00:02:49.500> skill<00:02:49.769> down<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.250> learn<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> few<00:02:50.670> more

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
your skill down and learn a few more

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.270 
your skill down and learn a few more
tricks<00:02:51.110> but<00:02:52.110> we'll<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:52.739> into<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.100> at

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
tricks but we'll get into that at

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.729 
tricks but we'll get into that at
another<00:02:53.610> time<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.959> you're<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.350> do<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
another time what you're going to do is

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.800 
another time what you're going to do is
just<00:02:56.190> kind<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.430> pick<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:56.670> wheel<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.180> turn<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
just kind of pick your wheel up turn it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.500 
just kind of pick your wheel up turn it
and<00:02:57.959> place<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.620> over<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.160> coping<00:02:59.670> what<00:03:00.330> this

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and place it over the coping what this

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.540 
and place it over the coping what this
does<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.380> allows<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.680> rest<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.280> your<00:03:02.370> bike

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
does is it allows the rest of your bike

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.960 
does is it allows the rest of your bike
to<00:03:02.910> clear<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.510> roll<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:05.280> remember<00:03:05.790> when

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
to clear and roll in now remember when

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.759 
to clear and roll in now remember when
you<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.300> come<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.050> turn<00:03:07.410> your<00:03:07.620> wheel

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
you do come in to turn your wheel

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.100 
you do come in to turn your wheel
towards<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> ramp<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.910> too<00:03:09.150> much<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:10.050> not

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
towards the ramp not too much but not

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.930 
towards the ramp not too much but not
too<00:03:10.440> little<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:10.830> if<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.340> too<00:03:11.400> little

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
too little because if you go too little

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.790 
too little because if you go too little
you'll<00:03:12.420> slide<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.200> go<00:03:13.350> too<00:03:13.410> much

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
you'll slide out if you go too much

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.590 
you'll slide out if you go too much
you'll<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> same<00:03:14.730> thing<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.269> kind<00:03:15.510> of

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
you'll do the same thing it's kind of

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.250 
you'll do the same thing it's kind of
like<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> break<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.190> basically<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:18.840> get

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
like a break so basically you just get

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.569 
like a break so basically you just get
back<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.970> set<00:03:21.209> your<00:03:21.390> pedals<00:03:21.750> up<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:23.250> start

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
back you set your pedals up you start

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.569 
back you set your pedals up you start
rolling<00:03:23.930> pick<00:03:24.930> your<00:03:25.079> wheel<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.680> go<00:03:27.170> now

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
rolling pick your wheel up and go now

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.460 
rolling pick your wheel up and go now
when<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.730> get<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> other<00:03:30.390> side<00:03:30.720> you're

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
when you get to the other side you're

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
when you get to the other side you're
going<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.680> practice<00:03:31.890> what<00:03:32.340> we<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:32.730> discussed

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
going to practice what we just discussed

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.810 
going to practice what we just discussed
you're<00:03:33.780> going<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.019> go<00:03:34.200> up<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.700> you're<00:03:35.700> going

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
you're going to go up and you're going

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.910 
you're going to go up and you're going
to<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:36.090> your<00:03:36.269> 180<00:03:36.720> which<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.290> where<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.620> turn<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
to do your 180 which is where you turn a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.979 
to do your 180 which is where you turn a
little<00:03:38.190> bit<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.670> bunnyhop<00:03:39.239> at<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.510> same<00:03:39.720> time

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
little bit and bunnyhop at the same time

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.800 
little bit and bunnyhop at the same time
turn<00:03:40.680> your<00:03:40.920> whole<00:03:41.100> body<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.610> your<00:03:41.670> bike<00:03:42.120> 180

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
turn your whole body and your bike 180

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.740 
turn your whole body and your bike 180
degrees<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:44.519> when<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.850> land<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.420> do

degrees and then when you land you do
the<00:03:45.900> pump<00:03:46.140> which<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.890> basically<00:03:47.430> where<00:03:47.730> you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
the pump which is basically where you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.150 
the pump which is basically where you
just<00:03:48.060> bend<00:03:48.299> your<00:03:48.390> knees<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.079> push<00:03:49.739> down<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
transition what this does is it keeps

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.259 
transition what this does is it keeps
your<00:03:52.440> momentum<00:03:52.799> up<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.310> then<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.820> come<00:03:54.060> back

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
your momentum up and then you come back

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.590 
your momentum up and then you come back
and<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.170> do<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.560> now<00:03:56.280> as<00:03:56.579> far<00:03:57.150> as<00:03:57.209> doing<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
and you do that now as far as doing the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.289 
and you do that now as far as doing the
180<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.320> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> be<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> same<00:03:59.489> concept<00:04:00.120> as

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
180 is going to be the same concept as

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.770 
180 is going to be the same concept as
your<00:04:00.480> pedals<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.519> rolling<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.269> ride
