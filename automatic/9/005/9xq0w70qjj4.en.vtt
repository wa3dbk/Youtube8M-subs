00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
alright today I have a review of the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.360 
alright today I have a review of the
cooler<00:00:04.080> master<00:00:04.589> hyper<00:00:04.620> tx3<00:00:05.580> on<00:00:06.680> heat<00:00:07.680> sink<00:00:07.950> for

means 1155 1156 but 1156 1155 with Sam

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
means 1155 1156 but 1156 1155 with Sam
and<00:00:20.330> 1366<00:00:21.330> socket<00:00:22.189> open<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.689> what's<00:00:24.689> out

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and 1366 socket open this up what's out

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.220 
and 1366 socket open this up what's out
here<00:00:24.980> here's<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> heatsink<00:00:26.640> comes<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> 90

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
here here's the heatsink comes with a 90

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.430 
here here's the heatsink comes with a 90
2<00:00:28.500> millimeter<00:00:28.920> fan<00:00:29.570> good<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:33.440> bottom

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
2 millimeter fan good to see that bottom

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.979 
2 millimeter fan good to see that bottom
let's<00:00:35.219> peel<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.790> off<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.570> nice<00:00:36.780> it

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
let's peel this off and see how nice it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.799 
let's peel this off and see how nice it
is<00:00:37.050> under<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:39.590> pretty<00:00:40.590> smooth<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.460> has<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
is under here pretty smooth but it has a

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.180 
is under here pretty smooth but it has a
I'd<00:00:42.809> expected<00:00:43.320> since<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> copper<00:00:43.860> pipes<00:00:44.040> go

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I'd expected since the copper pipes go

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.670 
I'd expected since the copper pipes go
through<00:00:44.430> direct<00:00:45.000> touch<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.899> gotta<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.500> some

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
through direct touch it's gotta got some

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.090 
through direct touch it's gotta got some
grooves<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.329> fine

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
grooves in here but you know that's fine

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
grooves in here but you know that's fine
let's<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.430> over<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.629> what's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
let's put that down over here see what's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:10.609 
let's put that down over here see what's
in<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.309> guess<00:00:53.309> accessory<00:00:53.879> box<00:00:59.510> okay<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:09.619> we

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
in this I guess accessory box okay so we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.789 
in this I guess accessory box okay so we
have<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.010> mounting<00:01:11.460> screws<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.799> thermal

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
have some mounting screws and thermal

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.520 
have some mounting screws and thermal
compound<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.840> some<00:01:15.990> mounting<00:01:16.290> screws

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
compound so there's some mounting screws

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.910 
compound so there's some mounting screws
thermal<00:01:16.830> compound<00:01:17.479> um<00:01:23.750> guessing<00:01:24.750> AMD<00:01:25.560> clips

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
thermal compound um guessing AMD clips

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.580 
thermal compound um guessing AMD clips
for<00:01:26.990> installing<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:31.610> these<00:01:32.610> pushpin<00:01:33.270> ones

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
for installing and these pushpin ones

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.429 
for installing and these pushpin ones
for<00:01:34.590> Intel<00:01:35.159> sockets<00:01:35.579> I'm<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:35.939> sure<00:01:39.049> yeah

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.039 

and<00:01:43.439> let's<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.149> show<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> some<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and let's see got that show you some of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.100 
and let's see got that show you some of
those<00:01:47.840> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:01.469 

comes<00:01:53.110> with<00:01:54.930> instructions<00:01:57.479> um<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:01.180> so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
comes with instructions um yeah so

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.810 
comes with instructions um yeah so
that's<00:02:01.899> all<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.049> got<00:02:02.310> here's<00:02:03.310> another<00:02:03.399> look<00:02:03.700> at

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
that's all we got here's another look at

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.109 
that's all we got here's another look at
the<00:02:03.880> heat<00:02:04.030> sink<00:02:04.210> again<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:06.549> we'll<00:02:06.880> do

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
the heat sink again and then we'll do

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.540 
the heat sink again and then we'll do
the<00:02:07.149> review<00:02:07.630> when<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:08.769> my<00:02:09.009> system

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.500 

alright<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.790> today<00:02:13.030> I'm<00:02:13.239> going<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.420> be

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
alright so today I'm going to be

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.120 
alright so today I'm going to be
reviewing<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.110> performance<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.860> cooler

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
reviewing the performance of the cooler

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
reviewing the performance of the cooler
master<00:02:15.610> hyper<00:02:15.640> tx3<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.519> my<00:02:18.519> tests<00:02:18.819> are<00:02:19.060> going

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
master hyper tx3 and my tests are going

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.680 
master hyper tx3 and my tests are going
to<00:02:19.269> involve<00:02:21.000> testing<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> fan<00:02:22.300> speed<00:02:22.450> from

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
to involve testing the fan speed from

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.660 
to involve testing the fan speed from
the<00:02:22.720> motherboard<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.470> fan<00:02:23.890> speed<00:02:24.130> level<00:02:24.430> one

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the motherboard on fan speed level one

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.970 
the motherboard on fan speed level one
and<00:02:24.850> seeing<00:02:25.720> what<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> temperature<00:02:26.350> are<00:02:26.680> on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
and seeing what the temperature are on

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.009 
and seeing what the temperature are on
idle<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:27.790> when<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.239> put<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> load<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
idle and then when you put a load on the

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.140 
idle and then when you put a load on the
CPU<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.799> fans<00:02:30.280> video<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.730> up<00:02:30.880> what<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
CPU and the fans video is up what the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.030 
CPU and the fans video is up what the
temperature<00:02:31.480> are<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.989> then<00:02:32.739> put<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
temperature are then and then put the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.220 
temperature are then and then put the
fan<00:02:33.190> speed<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.549> all<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.940> way<00:02:34.060> on<00:02:34.180> 10<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.660> see

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
fan speed on all the way on 10 and see

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
fan speed on all the way on 10 and see
what<00:02:35.319> happens<00:02:35.530> when<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.709> put<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.100> load

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
what happens when you put it on the load

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.620 
what happens when you put it on the load
if<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.760> stays<00:02:36.940> cooler<00:02:37.239> because<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
if it's just stays cooler because the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.110 
if it's just stays cooler because the
fan<00:02:37.780> speeds<00:02:38.049> been<00:02:38.200> high<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.410> whole<00:02:38.590> time<00:02:39.120> so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
fan speeds been high the whole time so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.729 
fan speeds been high the whole time so
right<00:02:40.269> now<00:02:40.299> my<00:02:40.660> fan<00:02:40.840> speeds<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.590> my

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
right now my fan speeds on one and my

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.520 
right now my fan speeds on one and my
test<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:43.150> fan<00:02:43.360> speeds<00:02:43.600> on<00:02:43.690> one<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.140> 25

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
test on my fan speeds on one we have 25

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.740 
test on my fan speeds on one we have 25
degrees<00:02:44.890> Celsius<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.519> minimum<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:45.970> about

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
degrees Celsius on the minimum and about

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.809 
degrees Celsius on the minimum and about
31<00:02:47.319> degrees<00:02:47.560> Celsius<00:02:48.069> max<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.430> all<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.610> course

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
31 degrees Celsius max in all the course

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:49.830 
31 degrees Celsius max in all the course
so<00:02:48.970> that's<00:02:49.120> good<00:02:49.330> that's<00:02:49.540> really<00:02:49.720> good

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
so that's good that's really good

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.979 
so that's good that's really good
temperatures<00:02:50.349> so<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:51.370> my<00:02:51.519> test<00:02:51.870> believe<00:02:52.870> it

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
temperatures so now my test believe it

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.960 
temperatures so now my test believe it
or<00:02:53.049> not<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.410> going<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.340> runescape

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
or not is going to be for runescape

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.520 
or not is going to be for runescape
pages<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.109> if<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.260> don't<00:02:56.380> know<00:02:56.440> what

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
pages and if you don't know what

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.970 
pages and if you don't know what
runescape<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.280> heavily<00:02:57.700> heavily<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.950> a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
runescape is it's heavily heavily like a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.910 
runescape is it's heavily heavily like a
really<00:03:00.340> heavy<00:03:00.579> game<00:03:00.910> java<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:01.799> we're<00:03:02.799> going

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
really heavy game java and we're going

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.229 
really heavy game java and we're going
to<00:03:02.950> open<00:03:03.190> these<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.700> i'm<00:03:03.850> going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.000> fast

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
to open these up and i'm going to fast

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.250 
to open these up and i'm going to fast
take<00:03:04.420> out<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:04.690> i'm<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.900> showing<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.109> what

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
take out here i'm just showing you what

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.300 
take out here i'm just showing you what
i<00:03:05.290> mean<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.560> we're<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.799> open<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.040> four<00:03:06.250> of

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
i mean if we're going to open up four of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.009 
i mean if we're going to open up four of
these<00:03:06.400> pages<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.329> we're<00:03:07.420> going<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.570> run<00:03:07.780> them

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
these pages and we're going to run them

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.080 
these pages and we're going to run them
in<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.320> java<00:03:08.560> icon<00:03:09.040> will<00:03:09.220> be<00:03:09.489> down<00:03:09.670> here<00:03:09.700> which

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
in the java icon will be down here which

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.360 
in the java icon will be down here which
is<00:03:10.209> already<00:03:10.359> is<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.930> when<00:03:11.380> we<00:03:11.470> take<00:03:11.950> back<00:03:12.160> i'll

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
is already is and when we take back i'll

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.680 
is already is and when we take back i'll
show<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.579> it's<00:03:12.760> all<00:03:12.850> high<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
show you it's all high but and that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.759 
show you it's all high but and that
cores<00:03:13.959> are<00:03:14.079> going<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.260> be<00:03:14.320> even<00:03:14.440> they're<00:03:14.739> just

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
cores are going to be even they're just

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.300 
cores are going to be even they're just
going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.100> pounded<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:16.239> i<00:03:16.769> will<00:03:17.769> be<00:03:17.799> back

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.580 

alright<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.090> now<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.510> see<00:03:21.750> from<00:03:22.349> over

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
alright so now you can see from over

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.860 
alright so now you can see from over
here<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> CPU<00:03:23.790> usage<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.630> pounding

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
here that the CPU usage is just pounding

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.750 
here that the CPU usage is just pounding
because<00:03:25.410> i<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.680> three<00:03:25.920> runescape<00:03:26.310> pages<00:03:26.610> up

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
because i have three runescape pages up

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.449 
because i have three runescape pages up
all<00:03:27.599> in<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.410> java<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:29.190> doing<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
all in the java and that's doing the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.160 
all in the java and that's doing the
inmates<00:03:29.760> screen<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.300> just<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:31.110> if

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
inmates screen and it's just see if

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.229 
inmates screen and it's just see if
users<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.680> load<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.640> can<00:03:32.670> even<00:03:32.849> see<00:03:32.970> that

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
users going load you can even see that

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.030 
users going load you can even see that
all<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> cores<00:03:34.020> on<00:03:34.170> their<00:03:34.260> minimum<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> 24<00:03:34.890> but

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
all the cores on their minimum is 24 but

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.850 
all the cores on their minimum is 24 but
now<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.160> highest<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.580> 40<00:03:36.000> now<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.709> came

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
now the highest is 40 now I just came

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.229 
now the highest is 40 now I just came
here<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.069> show<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.519> runescape<00:03:38.849> pages<00:03:39.150> are

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
here to show you the runescape pages are

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.000 
here to show you the runescape pages are
running<00:03:39.510> I'll<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.900> back<00:03:40.110> here<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.530> about<00:03:40.620> 10

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
running I'll be back here in about 10

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.400 
running I'll be back here in about 10
minutes<00:03:41.220> it's<00:03:41.760> 1252<00:03:42.239> I'll<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:43.050> back<00:03:43.200> here<00:03:43.380> on

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
minutes it's 1252 I'll be back here on

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.710 
minutes it's 1252 I'll be back here on
one<00:03:43.769> or<00:03:43.950> someone<00:03:44.220> may<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.730> 105<00:03:45.300> or<00:03:45.510> something

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
one or someone may be 105 or something

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.050 
one or someone may be 105 or something
and<00:03:46.019> we'll<00:03:46.170> see<00:03:46.410> how<00:03:46.769> heavy<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.700> CPU

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
and we'll see how heavy the CPU

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.089 
and we'll see how heavy the CPU
temperatures<00:03:48.420> are<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.080> also<00:03:49.230> don't

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
temperatures are then but also don't

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.890 
temperatures are then but also don't
think<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.760> bad<00:03:51.030> because<00:03:51.269> these<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.720> really

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
think it's bad because these are really

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.580 
think it's bad because these are really
heavy<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.690> really<00:03:54.690> heavy<00:03:54.989> stuff

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
heavy this is like a really heavy stuff

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.300 
heavy this is like a really heavy stuff
coming<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.100> here<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.850> also<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.680> totally<00:03:59.190> is

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
coming on here so also this totally is

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.050 
coming on here so also this totally is
wiping<00:03:59.549> out<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.030> stock<00:04:00.780> AMD<00:04:01.400> cpu<00:04:02.400> cooler<00:04:02.640> just

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
wiping out the stock AMD cpu cooler just

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.220 
wiping out the stock AMD cpu cooler just
for<00:04:03.150> information<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.750> i'll<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:03.989> those

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
for information and i'll have those

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.780 
for information and i'll have those
results<00:04:04.410> for<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.830> old<00:04:04.980> one<00:04:05.190> at<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> end<00:04:05.430> it's

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
results for the old one at the end it's

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.220 
results for the old one at the end it's
just<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.090> didn't<00:04:06.330> do<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> video<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.780> those<00:04:06.989> ones

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
just I didn't do a video on those ones

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
just I didn't do a video on those ones
because<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.530> totally<00:04:08.010> forgot<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.489> recall<00:04:08.760> my

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
because I totally forgot to recall my

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.600 
because I totally forgot to recall my
recorder<00:04:09.630> was<00:04:09.750> messed<00:04:09.930> up<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.739> we'll<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.430> back

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
recorder was messed up so we'll be back

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.320 
recorder was messed up so we'll be back
then<00:04:13.190> ok<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.220> didn't<00:04:14.459> even<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.760> wait<00:04:15.060> that

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
then ok I didn't even have to wait that

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.240 
then ok I didn't even have to wait that
long<00:04:15.840> because<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.440> already<00:04:16.620> doing<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.950> you

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
long because it's already doing it you

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.129 
long because it's already doing it you
could<00:04:17.400> probably<00:04:17.609> hear<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.060> fan<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.660> ramped

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
could probably hear the fan it is ramped

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.560 
could probably hear the fan it is ramped
up<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.440> lot<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.250> all<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.579> 10<00:04:20.820> 10<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.299> mean<00:04:21.450> on

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
up a lot it's all in the 10 10 I mean on

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.900 
up a lot it's all in the 10 10 I mean on
the<00:04:21.600> 10<00:04:21.959> fan<00:04:22.440> speed<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.710> know<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.220> because<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
the 10 fan speed I know it because the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.170 
the 10 fan speed I know it because the
RPM<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.419> at<00:04:24.570> 3,000<00:04:25.440> almost<00:04:26.160> that's<00:04:26.640> more<00:04:27.120> than

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
RPM is at 3,000 almost that's more than

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.950 
RPM is at 3,000 almost that's more than
double<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.650> was<00:04:28.800> when<00:04:29.070> it's<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.370> on

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
double that it was when it's on I on

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.100 
double that it was when it's on I on
level<00:04:30.960> one<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.880> lowest<00:04:33.240> score<00:04:33.419> still<00:04:33.660> 24

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
level one so the lowest score still 24

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.080 
level one so the lowest score still 24
by<00:04:34.260> think<00:04:34.440> that's<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.770> glitch<00:04:35.090> the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
by think that's just a glitch the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.900 
by think that's just a glitch the
highest<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.600> 44<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.229> average<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.650> 40<00:04:37.979> so<00:04:38.789> the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
highest is 44 the average is 40 so the

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.750 
highest is 44 the average is 40 so the
average<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.419> 40<00:04:39.750> degrees<00:04:40.080> Celsius<00:04:40.620> what<00:04:41.580> they

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
average is 40 degrees Celsius what they

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.279 
average is 40 degrees Celsius what they
cpu<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.479> totally<00:04:43.229> stressed<00:04:43.800> out<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.780> at<00:04:45.780> 44

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
cpu just totally stressed out and at 44

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.120 
cpu just totally stressed out and at 44
so<00:04:46.640> that's<00:04:47.640> your<00:04:47.850> average<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:48.570> for<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:49.130> and

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
so that's your average but for that and

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.879 
so that's your average but for that and
what<00:04:50.550> we're<00:04:50.970> going<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.150> do<00:04:51.240> then<00:04:51.450> now<00:04:51.740> is<00:04:52.740> I'm

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
what we're going to do then now is I'm

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.219 
what we're going to do then now is I'm
going<00:04:53.039> to<00:04:53.100> shut<00:04:53.340> all<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:53.639> off<00:04:53.789> in<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.000> sec<00:04:54.240> do

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
going to shut all this off in a sec do

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.629 
going to shut all this off in a sec do
it<00:04:55.350> on<00:04:55.440> fan<00:04:55.650> speed<00:04:55.889> one

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.480 

and<00:04:58.879> then<00:04:59.349> after<00:05:00.349> and<00:05:00.770> then<00:05:00.889> I<00:05:00.949> mean<00:05:01.099> on<00:05:01.219> fan

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
and then after and then I mean on fan

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.890 
and then after and then I mean on fan
speed<00:05:01.729> 10<00:05:01.909> and<00:05:02.060> then<00:05:02.120> after<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.479> i'll<00:05:02.689> show

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
speed 10 and then after that i'll show

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.529 
speed 10 and then after that i'll show
you<00:05:02.960> on<00:05:03.520> Microsoft<00:05:04.520> Paint<00:05:04.729> that<00:05:05.060> I've<00:05:05.180> written

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
you on Microsoft Paint that I've written

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.769 
you on Microsoft Paint that I've written
down<00:05:05.689> of<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.020> averages<00:05:06.469> of<00:05:06.499> the<00:05:06.999> old<00:05:07.999> stock

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
down of the averages of the old stock

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.989 
down of the averages of the old stock
heatsink<00:05:09.069> but<00:05:10.069> I<00:05:10.099> didn't<00:05:10.520> do<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.759> for<00:05:10.789> all<00:05:10.969> the

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:10.999 
heatsink but I didn't do it for all the

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:12.610 
heatsink but I didn't do it for all the
fan<00:05:11.240> speeds<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.569> automatically<00:05:12.020> had<00:05:12.349> it<00:05:12.499> on

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
fan speeds I automatically had it on

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.040 
fan speeds I automatically had it on
choose<00:05:13.460> where<00:05:13.789> I'd<00:05:13.879> just<00:05:14.210> totally<00:05:14.779> beyond

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
choose where I'd just totally beyond

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.379 
choose where I'd just totally beyond
like<00:05:15.259> a<00:05:15.289> three<00:05:15.770> or<00:05:15.860> four<00:05:16.069> on<00:05:16.219> Idol<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.729> went<00:05:17.300> to

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
like a three or four on Idol and went to

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.360 
like a three or four on Idol and went to
10<00:05:17.599> so<00:05:17.840> I'm<00:05:17.930> sorry<00:05:18.169> for<00:05:18.409> that<00:05:18.529> so<00:05:19.159> it's<00:05:19.279> not

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
10 so I'm sorry for that so it's not

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.950 
10 so I'm sorry for that so it's not
that<00:05:19.430> accurate<00:05:19.849> but<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.449> is<00:05:20.569> pretty<00:05:20.749> accurate

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
that accurate but it is pretty accurate

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.450 
that accurate but it is pretty accurate
and<00:05:21.319> then<00:05:21.439> i'll<00:05:21.529> show<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.860> average<00:05:22.099> fan

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
and then i'll show you the average fan

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.489 
and then i'll show you the average fan
speed<00:05:22.669> one<00:05:22.819> fan<00:05:22.999> speed<00:05:23.210> 10<00:05:23.419> here<00:05:23.659> I<00:05:23.840> don't<00:05:24.439> know

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:24.499 
speed one fan speed 10 here I don't know

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:25.480 
speed one fan speed 10 here I don't know
if<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.650> much<00:05:24.770> it's<00:05:24.919> going<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.069> chain<00:05:25.279> from

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
if you much it's going to chain from

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.689 
if you much it's going to chain from
here<00:05:25.699> but<00:05:26.629> the<00:05:27.110> average<00:05:27.259> 39<00:05:27.949> degrees<00:05:28.129> Celsius

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
here but the average 39 degrees Celsius

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.070 
here but the average 39 degrees Celsius
so<00:05:29.240> now<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.389> just<00:05:29.539> automatically<00:05:30.169> be<00:05:30.379> on<00:05:30.499> 10<00:05:30.740> and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
so now I just automatically be on 10 and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.760 
so now I just automatically be on 10 and
we<00:05:33.080> will<00:05:33.409> be<00:05:33.680> back<00:05:33.979> then

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
we will be back then

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.490 
we will be back then
alright<00:05:36.550> so<00:05:36.729> we're<00:05:36.970> on<00:05:37.090> fan<00:05:37.330> speed<00:05:37.599> 10<00:05:37.840> now<00:05:38.020> by

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
alright so we're on fan speed 10 now by

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.920 
alright so we're on fan speed 10 now by
default<00:05:38.680> on<00:05:39.009> Idol<00:05:39.340> or<00:05:39.789> getting<00:05:40.120> about<00:05:40.300> 26

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
default on Idol or getting about 26

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.339 
default on Idol or getting about 26
degrees<00:05:41.289> average<00:05:42.069> 24<00:05:42.729> minimum<00:05:43.629> and<00:05:43.840> 29

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
degrees average 24 minimum and 29

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.950

maximum<00:05:45.120> completely<00:05:46.120> doing<00:05:46.389> nothing<00:05:46.629> so<00:05:46.780> that

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
maximum completely doing nothing so that

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.510 
maximum completely doing nothing so that
doesn't<00:05:47.289> really<00:05:47.319> change<00:05:47.500> that<00:05:48.009> much<00:05:48.069> from<00:05:48.400> one

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
doesn't really change that much from one

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.240 
doesn't really change that much from one
is<00:05:48.639> on<00:05:48.729> fan<00:05:48.940> speed<00:05:49.240> one<00:05:49.509> but<00:05:50.379> it<00:05:50.590> will<00:05:50.949> probably

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
is on fan speed one but it will probably

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.249 
is on fan speed one but it will probably
change<00:05:51.550> when<00:05:51.819> we<00:05:51.909> kick<00:05:52.090> it<00:05:52.210> up<00:05:52.330> now<00:05:52.750> just<00:05:53.139> a

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
change when we kick it up now just a

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.800 
change when we kick it up now just a
little<00:05:53.710> you<00:05:54.180> probably<00:05:55.180> hear<00:05:55.419> when<00:05:55.599> I<00:05:55.629> move

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
little you probably hear when I move

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.450 
little you probably hear when I move
them<00:05:55.990> like<00:05:56.139> if<00:05:56.319> you<00:05:56.440> hear<00:05:56.650> that<00:05:56.830> fan<00:05:58.979> so<00:05:59.979> now

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
them like if you hear that fan so now

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.700 
them like if you hear that fan so now
I'm<00:06:00.819> going<00:06:00.970> to<00:06:01.090> stop<00:06:01.750> do<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.199> runescape<00:06:02.560> page

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
I'm going to stop do the runescape page

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.159 
I'm going to stop do the runescape page
just<00:06:02.889> got<00:06:03.099> show<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.460> guys<00:06:03.669> just<00:06:04.000> for<00:06:04.060> now<00:06:04.330> but

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
this time I'm not going to do the double

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.800 
this time I'm not going to do the double
take<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.639> show<00:06:06.909> you<00:06:06.970> if<00:06:07.090> me<00:06:07.240> open<00:06:07.599> it<00:06:07.659> i'm<00:06:07.780> just

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.339 
for about five or ten minutes show you
out<00:06:11.889> what<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.520> temperatures<00:06:12.970> are<00:06:13.120> then<00:06:13.930> we'll

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
out what the temperatures are then we'll

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.320 
out what the temperatures are then we'll
go<00:06:14.590> back<00:06:14.830> i'll<00:06:15.159> put<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.669> fan<00:06:15.849> speed<00:06:15.970> back<00:06:16.210> to

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
go back i'll put the fan speed back to

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.430 
go back i'll put the fan speed back to
one<00:06:16.449> or<00:06:16.569> whatever<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:16.960> then<00:06:17.080> i'll<00:06:17.199> show<00:06:17.380> you

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
one or whatever and then i'll show you

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.680 
one or whatever and then i'll show you
the<00:06:17.740> temperatures<00:06:18.159> on<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.460> screen<00:06:18.880> from<00:06:19.419> the

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
the temperatures on the screen from the

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.050 
the temperatures on the screen from the
old<00:06:19.840> hand<00:06:20.050> sink<00:06:20.289> to<00:06:20.440> now<00:06:20.650> and<00:06:20.949> what<00:06:21.819> a

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
old hand sink to now and what a

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.820 
old hand sink to now and what a
difference<00:06:22.539> it<00:06:22.720> is<00:06:22.750> when<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.110> cpu<00:06:23.289> is<00:06:23.590> just

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
difference it is when the cpu is just

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.959 
difference it is when the cpu is just
totally<00:06:24.130> stressed<00:06:24.490> so<00:06:25.120> we<00:06:25.960> will<00:06:26.259> be<00:06:26.409> back<00:06:26.620> then

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.080 

so<00:06:31.969> the<00:06:32.659> fan<00:06:32.900> speeds<00:06:33.370> on<00:06:34.370> 10<00:06:34.699> didn't<00:06:34.939> really

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
so the fan speeds on 10 didn't really

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.749 
so the fan speeds on 10 didn't really
make<00:06:35.210> much<00:06:35.360> of<00:06:35.389> a<00:06:35.539> difference<00:06:36.279> the<00:06:37.279> average<00:06:37.460> if

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
make much of a difference the average if

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.619 
make much of a difference the average if
you<00:06:37.879> look<00:06:37.999> in<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.150> video<00:06:38.360> is<00:06:38.419> the<00:06:38.509> average

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
you look in the video is the average

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.140 
you look in the video is the average
still<00:06:38.960> 39<00:06:39.259> but<00:06:40.189> the<00:06:40.219> Max's<00:06:40.789> are<00:06:40.909> different

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
still 39 but the Max's are different

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.269 
still 39 but the Max's are different
than<00:06:41.240> max<00:06:41.389> vs<00:06:41.689> 4<00:06:41.870> for<00:06:42.020> 24<00:06:42.169> in<00:06:42.319> the<00:06:42.439> max<00:06:42.680> it's<00:06:42.919> 39

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.279 
than max vs 4 for 24 in the max it's 39

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.920 
than max vs 4 for 24 in the max it's 39
remember<00:06:43.849> a<00:06:43.879> hardware<00:06:44.300> monitor<00:06:44.479> screen

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
remember a hardware monitor screen

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.619 
remember a hardware monitor screen
village<00:06:45.169> so<00:06:46.159> the<00:06:46.310> max<00:06:46.520> is<00:06:46.729> still<00:06:46.819> 39<00:06:47.210> so<00:06:47.479> that

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
village so the max is still 39 so that

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.580 
village so the max is still 39 so that
so<00:06:48.379> the<00:06:48.740> average<00:06:48.889> is<00:06:49.159> about<00:06:49.249> I<00:06:50.199> don't<00:06:51.199> know<00:06:51.259> I'm

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
so the average is about I don't know I'm

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.839 
so the average is about I don't know I'm
not<00:06:51.740> going<00:06:51.919> to<00:06:52.009> do<00:06:52.099> the<00:06:52.189> math<00:06:52.370> on<00:06:52.520> this<00:06:52.580> one

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
not going to do the math on this one

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:53.980 
not going to do the math on this one
because<00:06:52.969> it's<00:06:53.210> not<00:06:53.389> really<00:06:53.629> it's<00:06:53.840> not<00:06:53.900> really

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
because it's not really it's not really

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.360 
because it's not really it's not really
that<00:06:54.259> pointless<00:06:54.560> but<00:06:54.830> it's<00:06:54.979> a<00:06:55.039> couple<00:06:55.279> degrees

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
that pointless but it's a couple degrees

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.969 
that pointless but it's a couple degrees
less<00:06:55.759> because<00:06:56.659> if<00:06:56.900> the<00:06:57.020> max<00:06:57.199> was<00:06:57.379> 44<00:06:57.770> now<00:06:57.919> the

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
less because if the max was 44 now the

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:59.860 
less because if the max was 44 now the
max<00:06:58.189> is<00:06:58.310> 39<00:06:58.699> but<00:06:58.909> the<00:06:58.939> average<00:06:59.120> is<00:06:59.360> still<00:06:59.569> 39

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
max is 39 but the average is still 39

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.119 
max is 39 but the average is still 39
that<00:07:00.199> doesn't<00:07:00.409> really<00:07:00.499> make<00:07:00.650> sense<00:07:00.710> to<00:07:01.039> me

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:01.129 
that doesn't really make sense to me

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.709 
that doesn't really make sense to me
that's<00:07:01.669> why<00:07:01.849> I<00:07:01.879> hardware<00:07:02.240> monitor<00:07:02.389> is<00:07:02.599> at

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:02.719 
that's why I hardware monitor is at

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:07.209 
that's why I hardware monitor is at
fault<00:07:03.310> but<00:07:04.599> the<00:07:05.599> max<00:07:05.839> was<00:07:06.499> 44<00:07:06.979> degrees

00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:07.219 
fault but the max was 44 degrees

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:08.559 
fault but the max was 44 degrees
temperature<00:07:07.789> you<00:07:07.879> guys<00:07:07.999> can<00:07:08.180> go<00:07:08.270> back<00:07:08.419> in<00:07:08.509> the

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569 
temperature you guys can go back in the

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.510 
temperature you guys can go back in the
video<00:07:08.749> I<00:07:08.960> pretty<00:07:09.469> sure<00:07:09.620> it's<00:07:09.740> 44<00:07:10.039> degrees<00:07:10.099> last

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
video I pretty sure it's 44 degrees last

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.269 
video I pretty sure it's 44 degrees last
now<00:07:11.060> is<00:07:11.120> 39<00:07:11.539> that's<00:07:12.229> a<00:07:12.409> big<00:07:12.529> degree<00:07:12.860> to<00:07:12.979> just

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:13.279 
now is 39 that's a big degree to just

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.890 
now is 39 that's a big degree to just
keep<00:07:13.400> the<00:07:13.580> fans<00:07:13.969> real<00:07:14.150> intent<00:07:14.449> but<00:07:14.599> it's<00:07:14.719> very

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
keep the fans real intent but it's very

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.529 
keep the fans real intent but it's very
loud<00:07:15.080> so<00:07:15.319> that's<00:07:15.469> that's<00:07:15.740> a<00:07:15.889> fault<00:07:16.159> so<00:07:17.060> now<00:07:17.270> I'm

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 
loud so that's that's a fault so now I'm

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:18.850 
loud so that's that's a fault so now I'm
going<00:07:17.659> to<00:07:17.779> get<00:07:17.930> get<00:07:18.229> out<00:07:18.319> here<00:07:18.499> and<00:07:18.560> then<00:07:18.740> i'll

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
going to get get out here and then i'll

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.290 
going to get get out here and then i'll
just<00:07:18.889> show<00:07:19.310> you<00:07:19.339> the<00:07:19.520> results<00:07:19.909> in<00:07:20.029> them<00:07:20.150> that's

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
just show you the results in them that's

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.959 
just show you the results in them that's
the<00:07:20.479> end<00:07:20.569> of<00:07:20.599> the<00:07:20.689> video<00:07:21.550> alright<00:07:22.550> so<00:07:22.699> here<00:07:22.879> are
