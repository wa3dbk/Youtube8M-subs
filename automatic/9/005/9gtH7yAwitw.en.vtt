00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
here and I'm going to put a little bit
of<00:01:11.659> dubbing<00:01:12.659> wax<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.900> we're<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
of dubbing wax on it and we're going to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.820 
of dubbing wax on it and we're going to
dub<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:17.000> that's<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> Fuzzle<00:01:18.830> method

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
dub this that's where the Fuzzle method

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.600 
dub this that's where the Fuzzle method
comes<00:01:20.009> into<00:01:20.280> play<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> dubbing

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
comes into play and then for the dubbing

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
comes into play and then for the dubbing
I'm<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> use<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.000> sin<00:01:24.509> yo<00:01:24.799> sculpt<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I'm going to use some sin yo sculpt and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
I'm going to use some sin yo sculpt and
olive<00:01:26.340> color<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> could<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.570> just

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
olive color and you could use just

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.520 
olive color and you could use just
whatever<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> nice<00:01:33.689> complementary

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
whatever this is a nice complementary

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
whatever this is a nice complementary
color<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.970> we're<00:01:36.180> dealing<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.450> here

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
color to what we're dealing with here

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560

to our pearl core braid okay so we've

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.580 
to our pearl core braid okay so we've
got<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:48.119> simply<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.110> wrap
