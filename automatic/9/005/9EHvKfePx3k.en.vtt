outside

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
outside
he<00:02:00.270> said<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> inside<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> couldn't<00:02:01.439> really

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
he said that inside you couldn't really

he said that inside you couldn't really
touch<00:02:01.890> beside<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> metal<00:02:03.030> work<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> side

touch beside the metal work on the side
of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> airframe<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.280> hot

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
of the airframe because it was so hot

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.240 
of the airframe because it was so hot
have<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> quick<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.200> inside<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.160> very

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
have a quick look inside it is very

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.940 
have a quick look inside it is very
cramped<00:02:08.879> much<00:02:09.179> smaller<00:02:09.569> inside<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.739> say

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
cramped much smaller inside as I say

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.979 
cramped much smaller inside as I say
then<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> aircraft<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.480> might<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.780> used

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
then then the aircraft you might be used

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.790 
then then the aircraft you might be used
to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

around three and a half hours and it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.740 
around three and a half hours and it
used<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.860> get<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.280> speeds<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.820> Mach<00:02:27.390> two

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.040 
used to get up to speeds of Mach two
which<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.140> twice<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.980> speed<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.550> sound

when you consider those speeds and this

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
when you consider those speeds and this
