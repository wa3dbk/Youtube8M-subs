all sorts of different things and I
think<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> depends<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> type<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> ball

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
think it depends on the type of ball

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
think it depends on the type of ball
fight<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.780> how<00:01:31.020> big<00:01:31.230> your<00:01:31.350> hands

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
fight that you want how big your hands

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
fight that you want how big your hands
are<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> hit<00:01:33.330> draws<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> don't<00:01:34.170> want

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
what's important for people I think to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.150 
what's important for people I think to
take<00:01:54.390> away<00:01:54.660> from<00:01:54.900> from<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.500> aspect<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:56.070> our

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
take away from from this aspect of our

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.030 
take away from from this aspect of our
conversation<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.210> Tour<00:01:57.780> players<00:01:58.080> really

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
conversation is that Tour players really

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.460 
conversation is that Tour players really
pay<00:01:59.250> attention<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.360> grips<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.900> they
