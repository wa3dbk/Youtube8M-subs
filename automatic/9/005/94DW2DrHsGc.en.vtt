hey youtubers the Cyberdyne 24 here to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
do a startup and also a run of the echo

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.030 
do a startup and also a run of the echo
PE<00:00:10.340> 265<00:00:11.340> edger<00:00:12.230> first<00:00:13.230> time<00:00:13.410> trying<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.740> start

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
PE 265 edger first time trying to start

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.019 
PE 265 edger first time trying to start
it<00:00:14.809> realize<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> spark<00:00:17.130> plug<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
it realize that the spark plug on it the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.929 
it realize that the spark plug on it the
electrode<00:00:18.770> has<00:00:19.770> got<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.400> V<00:00:20.699> notch

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
electrode has got like a little V notch

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.060 
electrode has got like a little V notch
in<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.170> don't<00:00:22.380> look<00:00:22.470> too<00:00:22.529> good<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
in it so that don't look too good so it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.109 
in it so that don't look too good so it
looks<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> pick<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.970> new

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
looks like I'm going to pick up a new

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
looks like I'm going to pick up a new
spark<00:00:24.779> plug<00:00:24.990> for<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> replaced<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
spark plug for that and so I replaced it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
spark plug for that and so I replaced it
with<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> spark<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> spark<00:00:29.970> plug<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.300> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
with a spark with a spark plug that I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200 
with a spark with a spark plug that I
got<00:00:30.570> laying<00:00:31.380> around<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.550> hopefully<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> will

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
got laying around so hopefully that will

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.330 
got laying around so hopefully that will
work<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.469> let's<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
work out so let's see if we can get this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:01:23.270 
work out so let's see if we can get this
thing<00:00:35.520> started<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.200> see<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.230> happens

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:37.500 

you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.360 

now<00:01:38.510> putting<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.050> spark<00:01:39.380> plug<00:01:39.590> in<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:43.010> turn

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
now putting the spark plug in you turn

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.300 
now putting the spark plug in you turn
over<00:01:43.400> so<00:01:46.720> I'll<00:01:47.720> definitely<00:01:47.930> have<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.410> go<00:01:48.530> go<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
over so I'll definitely have to go go to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.660 
over so I'll definitely have to go go to
my<00:01:49.460> echo<00:01:49.640> dealer<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.200> pick<00:01:52.190> up<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.490> right

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
my echo dealer and pick up the right

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.430 
my echo dealer and pick up the right
spark<00:01:53.060> plug<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.570> need<00:01:53.810> for<00:01:54.050> this<00:01:54.170> particular

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
spark plug I need for this particular

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.750 
spark plug I need for this particular
one<00:01:55.780> about<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:57.050> using<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> can

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
one about just using this so that I can

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.540 
one about just using this so that I can
just<00:01:59.290> get<00:02:00.290> your<00:02:00.530> demonstration<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.430> what

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
just get your demonstration and what

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.820 
just get your demonstration and what
exactly<00:02:02.120> just<00:02:02.330> how<00:02:02.930> good<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.320> trimmer<00:02:03.560> does

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
exactly just how good this trimmer does

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.740 
exactly just how good this trimmer does
so<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.160> Mississippi<00:02:10.060> put<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> camera<00:02:11.570> right

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
so I Mississippi put the camera right

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.310 
so I Mississippi put the camera right
here

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
here

00:02:12.320 --> 00:05:57.760 
here
now<00:02:12.530> let's<00:02:12.740> give<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.040> thing<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.340> shot

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.370 

Oh

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:32.640 

Oh

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.640 

as<00:06:33.650> you<00:06:33.919> can<00:06:34.069> see<00:06:34.900> they<00:06:35.900> actually<00:06:36.229> did<00:06:36.379> quite<00:06:36.530> a

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
as you can see they actually did quite a

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.999 
as you can see they actually did quite a
nice<00:06:36.889> job<00:06:37.449> and<00:06:38.449> if<00:06:39.379> you<00:06:39.500> actually<00:06:39.830> keep

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
nice job and if you actually keep

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.850 
nice job and if you actually keep
routine<00:06:40.879> upkeep<00:06:41.449> on<00:06:41.659> your<00:06:42.020> little<00:06:42.289> edge

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.189 

through<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:45.979> summer<00:06:46.280> spring<00:06:46.699> and<00:06:46.879> summer<00:06:47.199> it

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
through the summer spring and summer it

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.550 
through the summer spring and summer it
won't<00:06:48.500> be<00:06:48.620> as<00:06:48.740> bad<00:06:50.020> to<00:06:51.020> actually<00:06:51.379> do<00:06:51.529> all<00:06:51.560> this

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
won't be as bad to actually do all this

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:03.249 
won't be as bad to actually do all this
so<00:06:54.560> that<00:06:55.539> is<00:06:56.539> the<00:06:56.779> echo<00:06:57.849> PE<00:06:59.740> 265<00:07:00.740> edger<00:07:02.259> hope

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
so that is the echo PE 265 edger hope

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.340 
so that is the echo PE 265 edger hope
you<00:07:03.379> have<00:07:03.469> a<00:07:03.500> good<00:07:03.650> one<00:07:03.830> you<00:07:03.949> tubers
