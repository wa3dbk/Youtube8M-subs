in the first ten which is the easy set
and<00:00:10.679> we've<00:00:10.830> made<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.160> number<00:00:11.340> five<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and we've made it to number five this

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.629 
and we've made it to number five this
one's<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.019> little<00:00:13.259> bit<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.620> number<00:00:14.340> three

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
one's a little bit like number three

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.790 
one's a little bit like number three
it's<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.240> sort<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.660> descending<00:00:16.170> quarter

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
it's a it's sort of a descending quarter

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.109 
it's a it's sort of a descending quarter
note<00:00:16.920> pattern<00:00:17.400> now<00:00:17.789> there's<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> little

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
note pattern now there's a little

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.670 
note pattern now there's a little
turnaround<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> end<00:00:19.050> with<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.529> eighth

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
turnaround at the end with some eighth

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.029 
turnaround at the end with some eighth
notes<00:00:20.359> again<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.930> number<00:00:22.320> three<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.830> has

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
notes again like number three this has

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.089 
notes again like number three this has
the<00:00:23.189> option<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
the option if you want to of

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
the option if you want to of
interspersing<00:00:26.099> offbeat<00:00:27.029> C's<00:00:27.720> between<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
interspersing offbeat C's between the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.839 
interspersing offbeat C's between the
quarter<00:00:28.949> notes<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.400> descending<00:00:29.820> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
quarter notes that are descending you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.880 
quarter notes that are descending you
can<00:00:30.119> leave<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.859> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
can leave them in if you want or you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.700 
can leave them in if you want or you can
just<00:00:32.130> omit<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> I'll<00:00:34.320> play

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
just omit them it's up to you I'll play

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.729 
just omit them it's up to you I'll play
them<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> examples<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.140> remember<00:00:37.559> those

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
them in the examples but remember those

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.190 
them in the examples but remember those
offbeat<00:00:38.399> C's<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.059> left<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> works

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
offbeat C's can be left out and it works

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.880 
offbeat C's can be left out and it works
just<00:00:40.410> fine

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just fine

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
just fine
so<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.030> very<00:00:42.180> slowly<00:00:42.570> with

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so here it here it is very slowly with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:01:01.599 
so here it here it is very slowly with
the<00:00:43.020> metronome<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> notation<00:01:00.350> okay

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
the metronome and the notation okay

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.179 
the metronome and the notation okay
again<00:01:02.609> pretty<00:01:02.910> easy<00:01:03.890> technically<00:01:04.890> maybe<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
again pretty easy technically maybe a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.350 
again pretty easy technically maybe a
little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.729> challenging<00:01:06.240> because

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
little bit more challenging because

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.940 
little bit more challenging because
you've<00:01:06.570> got<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> full<00:01:06.990> octave<00:01:07.380> reach<00:01:07.619> there

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
you've got a full octave reach there

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
you've got a full octave reach there
between<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.460> C<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.360> top<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
between the C on the top and on the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.920 
between the C on the top and on the
bottom<00:01:10.909> but<00:01:11.909> still<00:01:12.119> we're<00:01:12.330> doing<00:01:12.510> pretty<00:01:12.659> good

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
bottom but still we're doing pretty good

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
bottom but still we're doing pretty good
just<00:01:13.740> practice<00:01:14.250> work<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.729> your<00:01:14.880> metronome

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just practice work with your metronome

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.700 
just practice work with your metronome
if<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.810> becoming<00:01:16.200> technically

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
if this is becoming technically

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260 
if this is becoming technically
challenging<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
challenging for you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
challenging for you
same<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> thing<00:01:19.110> anytime<00:01:19.439> you're<00:01:19.740> going

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
same kind of thing anytime you're going

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
same kind of thing anytime you're going
back<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.159> forth<00:01:20.610> over<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> course<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> an

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
back and forth over the course of an

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
back and forth over the course of an
entire<00:01:22.110> octave<00:01:22.560> many<00:01:23.369> times<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.060> an

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
entire octave many times you can get an

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.749 
entire octave many times you can get an
advantage<00:01:24.780> by<00:01:25.439> using<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:26.009> wrist<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
advantage by using your wrist and your

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.090 
advantage by using your wrist and your
arm<00:01:27.060> instead<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.960> fingers<00:01:28.409> don't<00:01:28.799> try<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
arm instead of your fingers don't try to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
arm instead of your fingers don't try to
reach<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.700> whole<00:01:29.909> octave<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.810> have

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
reach the whole octave if you have

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
reach the whole octave if you have
smaller<00:01:31.229> hands<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.670> play<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> top

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
smaller hands you know play the top

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
smaller hands you know play the top
notes<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:33.990> move<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.290> hand<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.680> kind

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
notes and then move your hand down kind

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
notes and then move your hand down kind
of<00:01:35.159> rotate<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:35.700> hand<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.840> makes<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> lot

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
of rotate your hand it makes it a lot
easier<00:01:37.350> keep<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.009> hand<00:01:38.340> relaxed<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.119> don't

easier keep your hand relaxed you don't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
easier keep your hand relaxed you don't
get<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.450> tired<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:40.860> technique<00:01:41.040> for

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
get as tired it's a good technique for

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.240 
get as tired it's a good technique for
playing<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.970> longer<00:01:42.240> stretches<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
playing out longer stretches like that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
playing out longer stretches like that
now<00:01:44.250> let's<00:01:44.460> take<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.790> lick<00:01:45.060> full-speed<00:01:46.049> with
