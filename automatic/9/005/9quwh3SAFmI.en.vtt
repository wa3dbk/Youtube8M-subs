Oh<00:00:15.070> close<00:00:15.519> look<00:00:15.880> at<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.540> new<00:00:16.570> CPU<00:00:17.290> that<00:00:17.470> I've

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
Oh close look at the new CPU that I've

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.010 
Oh close look at the new CPU that I've
just<00:00:17.740> bought<00:00:18.009> this<00:00:18.279> is<00:00:18.520> of<00:00:18.849> course<00:00:19.000> an<00:00:19.689> AMD

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
just bought this is of course an AMD

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.589 
just bought this is of course an AMD
processor<00:00:20.230> not<00:00:21.189> an<00:00:21.310> Intel<00:00:21.910> I<00:00:22.090> have<00:00:22.119> actually

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
processor not an Intel I have actually

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.330 
processor not an Intel I have actually
gone<00:00:22.750> for<00:00:23.020> this<00:00:23.169> particular<00:00:23.439> chip<00:00:23.829> because<00:00:24.009> of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
gone for this particular chip because of

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.979 
gone for this particular chip because of
the<00:00:24.520> price<00:00:24.790> I<00:00:25.060> thought<00:00:25.270> that<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.570> price<00:00:25.810> was

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
the price I thought that the price was

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.659 
the price I thought that the price was
absolutely<00:00:26.439> perfect<00:00:26.980> for<00:00:27.070> what<00:00:27.369> I<00:00:27.399> actually

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
absolutely perfect for what I actually

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.760 
absolutely perfect for what I actually
wanted<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.180> purchase<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:28.930> that<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.559> the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
wanted to purchase and that is the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.679 
wanted to purchase and that is the
deciding<00:00:30.189> factor<00:00:30.730> for<00:00:30.759> many<00:00:31.029> people<00:00:31.509> these

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
deciding factor for many people these

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.389 
deciding factor for many people these
days<00:00:31.750> unless<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.649> course<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:33.130> you

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
days unless of course that you

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.000 
days unless of course that you
definitely<00:00:33.670> want<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.270> dedicated<00:00:34.480> gaming<00:00:35.140> PC<00:00:35.770> or

the chip but anyway the specifications
of<00:01:00.640> this<00:01:01.060> processor<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.870> fact<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.170> it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
of this processor is the fact that it's

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.720 
of this processor is the fact that it's
actually<00:01:02.500> got<00:01:02.800> eight<00:01:03.010> cores

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
actually got eight cores

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.580 
actually got eight cores
yes<00:01:03.910> that's<00:01:04.149> right<00:01:04.299> eight<00:01:04.570> cause<00:01:05.049> not<00:01:05.379> just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
yes that's right eight cause not just

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.069 
yes that's right eight cause not just
four<00:01:05.890> or<00:01:06.159> six<00:01:06.640> but<00:01:06.939> eight<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.659> each<00:01:07.780> one<00:01:07.990> of

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
four or six but eight and each one of

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.539 
four or six but eight and each one of
those<00:01:08.200> calls<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.740> actually<00:01:09.009> running<00:01:09.189> at<00:01:09.490> a

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
those calls is actually running at a

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.210 
those calls is actually running at a
four<00:01:10.090> gigahertz<00:01:10.479> per<00:01:10.900> processor<00:01:11.500> now<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
four gigahertz per processor now the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.370 
four gigahertz per processor now the
actual<00:01:12.729> architecture<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.630> this<00:01:13.960> process

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
actual architecture of this process

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.469 
actual architecture of this process
allows<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:14.950> actually<00:01:15.550> be<00:01:15.670> turbo-boosted

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
allows it to actually be turbo-boosted

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.110 
allows it to actually be turbo-boosted
in<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:17.050> way<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.380> AMD<00:01:17.979> wanted<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.670> be<00:01:18.790> to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
in the way that AMD wanted to be to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.410 
in the way that AMD wanted to be to
actually<00:01:19.650> 4.2<00:01:20.650> gigahertz<00:01:21.159> per<00:01:21.580> processor<00:01:22.180> so

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
actually 4.2 gigahertz per processor so

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually 4.2 gigahertz per processor so
potentially<00:01:23.049> could<00:01:23.260> be<00:01:23.320> running<00:01:23.560> each<00:01:23.740> one<00:01:24.280> of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
potentially could be running each one of

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.760 
potentially could be running each one of
these<00:01:24.460> cores<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.240> processor<00:01:25.720> at<00:01:25.900> 4.2

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
these cores on this processor at 4.2

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.680 
these cores on this processor at 4.2
gigahertz<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.700> without<00:01:27.940> further<00:01:28.120> ado<00:01:28.390> without

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
gigahertz so without further ado without

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.630 
gigahertz so without further ado without
boring<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.320> death<00:01:29.530> let's<00:01:29.950> actually<00:01:30.370> get

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
boring it to death let's actually get

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.310 
boring it to death let's actually get
this<00:01:30.790> open<00:01:31.150> I've<00:01:31.270> actually<00:01:31.390> cut<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.840> seal<00:01:32.049> and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
this open I've actually cut the seal and

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.469 
this open I've actually cut the seal and
just<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.680> make<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.040> lot<00:01:33.280> easier<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.880> show

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
just to make this a lot easier to show

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.420 
just to make this a lot easier to show
you<00:01:34.540> on<00:01:34.900> camera<00:01:34.930> now<00:01:35.619> inside<00:01:36.010> you're<00:01:36.280> going<00:01:36.369> to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
you on camera now inside you're going to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.190 
you on camera now inside you're going to
be<00:01:36.549> presented<00:01:37.030> with<00:01:37.060> an<00:01:37.570> instruction<00:01:38.170> manual

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
be presented with an instruction manual

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.980 
be presented with an instruction manual
of<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.650> CPU<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.430> course<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.790> CPU<00:01:40.479> cooler

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
of the CPU and of course a CPU cooler

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.780 
of the CPU and of course a CPU cooler
now<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> standard<00:01:41.830> cooler<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.640> you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
now this is a standard cooler like you

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.000 
now this is a standard cooler like you
do<00:01:42.940> with<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.360> Intel<00:01:44.140> chips<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.770> what<00:01:44.920> we're

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
do with the Intel chips and what we're

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.890 
do with the Intel chips and what we're
gonna<00:01:45.100> do<00:01:45.250> is<00:01:45.430> basically<00:01:45.580> tip<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:46.180> out<00:01:46.390> we're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
gonna do is basically tip this out we're

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.730 
gonna do is basically tip this out we're
not<00:01:46.990> going<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.200> show<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.409> all<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
not going to show you all the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.590 
not going to show you all the
instructions<00:01:48.159> but<00:01:48.610> basically<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.299> is<00:01:49.360> just

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
instructions but basically this is just

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.300 
instructions but basically this is just
to<00:01:49.659> tell<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.900> about<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.229> CPU<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:51.040> of<00:01:51.100> course

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
to tell you about the CPU and of course

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.039 
to tell you about the CPU and of course
we're<00:01:51.549> not<00:01:51.580> really<00:01:51.850> interested<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.510> no

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
we're not really interested in that no

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.890 
we're not really interested in that no
this<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.950> course<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.610> CPU<00:01:55.270> right<00:01:55.600> here

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
this is of course the CPU right here

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.929 
this is of course the CPU right here
I've<00:01:56.080> actually<00:01:56.229> used<00:01:56.409> this<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.040> had<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.729> my

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
I've actually used this and had it in my

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.179 
I've actually used this and had it in my
system<00:01:58.360> -<00:01:58.659> obviously<00:01:58.900> test<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.590> out<00:01:59.680> and<00:01:59.890> make

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
system - obviously test it out and make

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.770 
system - obviously test it out and make
sure<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.670> actually<00:02:01.030> works<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.479> there's<00:02:01.630> no

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
sure that actually works and there's no

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.990 
sure that actually works and there's no
problems<00:02:02.200> with<00:02:02.259> it<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.439> repackaged<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.490> to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
problems with it a repackaged it and to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.330 
problems with it a repackaged it and to
bring<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.479> video<00:02:05.170> now<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.530> course<00:02:05.740> AMD

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
bring you this video now of course AMD

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.240 
bring you this video now of course AMD
also<00:02:06.759> were<00:02:07.000> include<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.750> sticker<00:02:08.679> as<00:02:09.009> does

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
also were include this sticker as does

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.009 
also were include this sticker as does
Intel<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.090> what<00:02:10.539> we're<00:02:10.659> gonna<00:02:10.750> show<00:02:10.989> you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
Intel and what we're gonna show you

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.589 
Intel and what we're gonna show you
basically<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.129> this<00:02:12.670> actual<00:02:13.330> chip

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
basically is that this actual chip

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.259 
basically is that this actual chip
actually<00:02:14.049> runs<00:02:14.349> with<00:02:14.769> pins<00:02:15.459> all<00:02:15.760> over<00:02:16.090> it

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
actually runs with pins all over it

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.000 
actually runs with pins all over it
unlike<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.719> Intel<00:02:17.109> system<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.709> actually

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
unlike the Intel system that actually

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.350 
unlike the Intel system that actually
uses<00:02:18.249> touch

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
uses touch

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.870 
uses touch
and<00:02:19.750> actually<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.710> got<00:02:21.160> written<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.640> these

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
and actually have got written that these

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.370 
and actually have got written that these
pins<00:02:22.210> because<00:02:22.420> obviously<00:02:22.630> if<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.990> bend<00:02:23.200> any

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
pins because obviously if you bend any

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
pins because obviously if you bend any
of<00:02:23.470> these<00:02:23.560> pins<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.100> renders<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.730> CPU

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
of these pins that renders the CPU

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.350 
of these pins that renders the CPU
useless<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.350> I've<00:02:26.650> got<00:02:26.800> an<00:02:27.070> older<00:02:27.400> Intel

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
useless but so I've got an older Intel

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.500 
useless but so I've got an older Intel
CPU<00:02:28.960> trying<00:02:29.350> not<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> drop<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.220> AMD<00:02:30.790> chip<00:02:31.240> so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
CPU trying not to drop this AMD chip so

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.760 
CPU trying not to drop this AMD chip so
we've<00:02:31.630> just<00:02:31.660> bear<00:02:31.960> with<00:02:31.990> me<00:02:32.140> while<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> get<00:02:32.620> this

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
we've just bear with me while I get this

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.650 
we've just bear with me while I get this
sorted<00:02:33.100> out<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.400> bring<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.390> better

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
sorted out and bring to you a better

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.330 
sorted out and bring to you a better
understanding<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.950> different<00:02:36.070> types

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
understanding of the different types

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.360 
understanding of the different types
this<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> seven<00:02:37.600> seven<00:02:37.960> five<00:02:38.230> socket<00:02:39.100> and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
this is the seven seven five socket and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.000 
this is the seven seven five socket and
actually<00:02:39.640> has<00:02:39.850> just<00:02:40.390> these<00:02:40.570> like<00:02:40.960> pads<00:02:41.320> on<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
actually has just these like pads on the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.040 
actually has just these like pads on the
actual<00:02:42.340> socket<00:02:42.790> that's<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.120> intel<00:02:43.540> one<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
actual socket that's the intel one and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.360 
actual socket that's the intel one and
as<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.320> see<00:02:44.380> all<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.770> workings<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
as you can see all the workings of the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.430 
as you can see all the workings of the
chip<00:02:45.580> actually<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.570> chip<00:02:46.810> itself<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.290> not

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
chip actually on the chip itself and not

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.650 
chip actually on the chip itself and not
on<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> motherboard<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.430> whereas<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.000> AMD

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
on the motherboard but whereas the AMD

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.390 
on the motherboard but whereas the AMD
obviously<00:02:50.290> hopefully<00:02:50.710> i'll<00:02:50.950> be<00:02:51.010> able<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.280> get

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
obviously hopefully i'll be able to get

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.000 
obviously hopefully i'll be able to get
that<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.700> there<00:02:52.000> VL<00:02:52.360> focus<00:02:52.870> hopefully<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.890> can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
that in there VL focus hopefully you can

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.650 
that in there VL focus hopefully you can
get<00:02:54.220> back<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.550> there<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.820> can<00:02:55.000> see<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.420> as

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
get back in there you can see this as

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.530 
get back in there you can see this as
multiple<00:02:56.560> rows<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:57.040> pins<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.760> those<00:02:58.240> pins

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
multiple rows of pins and those pins

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.910 
multiple rows of pins and those pins
that<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.690> have<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.990> be<00:02:59.080> very<00:02:59.320> very<00:02:59.650> careful

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
that you have to be very very careful

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.460 
that you have to be very very careful
with<00:03:00.340> now<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.820> this<00:03:01.030> chip<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.840> as<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.170> do<00:03:02.320> with

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
with now on this chip and as you do with

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.410 
with now on this chip and as you do with
any<00:03:02.620> other<00:03:02.740> chips<00:03:03.160> you'll<00:03:03.820> notice<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.300> in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
any other chips you'll notice that in

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.970 
any other chips you'll notice that in
one<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.720> corners<00:03:05.170> you'll<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:05.860> we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
one of the corners you'll see that we

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.740 
one of the corners you'll see that we
have<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:06.580> arrow<00:03:06.970> now<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.510> little

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
have this little arrow now this little

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.510 
have this little arrow now this little
arrow<00:03:08.020> will<00:03:08.290> actually<00:03:08.560> dictate<00:03:09.010> us<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.310> which

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
arrow will actually dictate us to which

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.699 
arrow will actually dictate us to which
way<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.090> chip<00:03:10.390> will<00:03:10.780> actually<00:03:11.230> fit<00:03:11.500> in

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
way that this chip will actually fit in

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.949 
way that this chip will actually fit in
the<00:03:12.100> socket<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:13.000> motherboard<00:03:13.240> so<00:03:13.480> there

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
the socket on the motherboard so there

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.850 
the socket on the motherboard so there
we<00:03:14.020> go<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> AMD<00:03:14.860> FX<00:03:15.660> 8350<00:03:16.660> cpu<00:03:17.560> as<00:03:17.740> you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
we go this is the AMD FX 8350 cpu as you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.890 
we go this is the AMD FX 8350 cpu as you
can<00:03:18.010> see<00:03:18.160> for<00:03:18.340> yourself<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.940> let<00:03:19.510> me<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:19.720> put

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
can see for yourself and let me just put

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.810 
can see for yourself and let me just put
this<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:20.320> side<00:03:20.380> very<00:03:21.010> carefully<00:03:21.580> like<00:03:21.760> I

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
this to one side very carefully like I

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.890 
this to one side very carefully like I
said<00:03:22.060> cause<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.270> don't<00:03:22.360> want<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.570> damage<00:03:22.780> the

said cause I don't want to damage the
pins<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.590> we'll<00:03:24.040> put<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.430> one<00:03:24.489> side<00:03:24.550> let

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
pins and we'll put that to one side let

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.670 
pins and we'll put that to one side let
you<00:03:25.060> have<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.269> look<00:03:25.390> at<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> CPU<00:03:26.080> cooler<00:03:26.320> now

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
you have a look at the CPU cooler now

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.620 
you have a look at the CPU cooler now
the<00:03:26.739> CPU<00:03:27.160> cooler<00:03:27.340> itself<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.300> a<00:03:28.390> standard

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
the CPU cooler itself is just a standard

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.960 
the CPU cooler itself is just a standard
CPU<00:03:29.320> cooler<00:03:29.709> Micah<00:03:29.950> mentioned<00:03:30.370> before

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
CPU cooler Micah mentioned before

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.350 
CPU cooler Micah mentioned before
you<00:03:31.480> get<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.840> same<00:03:32.260> kind<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.620> CPU<00:03:33.100> cooler<00:03:33.459> with

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
you get the same kind of CPU cooler with

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.960 
you get the same kind of CPU cooler with
the<00:03:34.510> Intel<00:03:34.840> system<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.610> one<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.940> a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
the Intel system but this one is a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.180 
the Intel system but this one is a
little<00:03:37.120> bit<00:03:37.300> different<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.769> what<00:03:38.800> must<00:03:39.040> be

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
little bit different to what must be

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.880 
little bit different to what must be
used<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.550> seen<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:41.380> one<00:03:41.650> actually

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
used to seen and this one actually

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.270 
used to seen and this one actually
itself<00:03:42.670> as<00:03:43.600> like<00:03:43.959> as<00:03:44.110> before<00:03:44.470> as<00:03:44.680> actually

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
itself as like as before as actually

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.580 
itself as like as before as actually
being<00:03:45.489> used<00:03:45.850> now<00:03:46.480> normally<00:03:47.110> as<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.320> can<00:03:47.440> see

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
being used now normally as you can see

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.250 
being used now normally as you can see
this<00:03:47.709> little<00:03:47.860> square<00:03:48.280> heat<00:03:48.640> here<00:03:49.300> on<00:03:49.510> this

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
this little square heat here on this

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.199 
this little square heat here on this
plate<00:03:51.070> this<00:03:51.610> normally<00:03:52.000> has<00:03:52.500> thermal<00:03:53.500> compound

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
plate this normally has thermal compound

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.699 
plate this normally has thermal compound
actually<00:03:55.209> already<00:03:55.600> applied<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.500> can

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
actually already applied so you can

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.440 
actually already applied so you can
basically<00:03:56.950> just<00:03:57.250> stick<00:03:57.519> that<00:03:57.550> in<00:03:57.850> there<00:03:58.060> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
basically just stick that in there and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.360 
basically just stick that in there and
fasten<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:58.989> down<00:03:59.200> which<00:03:59.739> incidentally<00:04:00.340> is

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
fasten it down which incidentally is

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.910 
fasten it down which incidentally is
fastened<00:04:00.850> down<00:04:01.000> by<00:04:01.870> these<00:04:02.080> two<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.560> have<00:04:02.680> one

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
fastened down by these two to have one

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.280 
fastened down by these two to have one
either<00:04:03.040> side<00:04:03.400> these<00:04:04.180> are<00:04:04.360> forced<00:04:04.840> leverage

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
either side these are forced leverage

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.920 
either side these are forced leverage
unlike<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.730> Intel<00:04:07.390> where<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.750> have

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
unlike this the Intel where you have

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.530 
unlike this the Intel where you have
four<00:04:08.530> individual<00:04:09.040> pins<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.489> surround<00:04:09.880> this

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
four individual pins that surround this

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.810 
four individual pins that surround this
is<00:04:10.750> actually<00:04:11.080> just<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.620> lever<00:04:12.040> either<00:04:12.280> side<00:04:12.580> and

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
is actually just a lever either side and

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.759 
is actually just a lever either side and
does<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.180> same<00:04:13.209> trick<00:04:13.630> you'll<00:04:14.350> see<00:04:14.560> there

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
does the same trick you'll see there

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.530 
does the same trick you'll see there
that<00:04:14.800> we<00:04:15.010> have<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.400> heat<00:04:15.790> pipes<00:04:16.120> which<00:04:16.390> are

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
that we have the heat pipes which are

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.330 
that we have the heat pipes which are
connected<00:04:16.900> directly<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.799> plate<00:04:18.100> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
connected directly to that plate and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.380 
connected directly to that plate and
then<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.180> course<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.400> where<00:04:21.580> was<00:04:21.700> I<00:04:21.880> if<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.210> don't

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
then of course so where was I if I don't

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.180 
then of course so where was I if I don't
really<00:04:22.630> interrupted<00:04:23.290> talking<00:04:23.560> about<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.040> this

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
really interrupted talking about so this

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.000 
really interrupted talking about so this
standard<00:04:24.970> CPU<00:04:25.510> cooler<00:04:25.900> moving<00:04:26.380> on<00:04:26.500> from<00:04:26.740> the

standard CPU cooler moving on from the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.219 
standard CPU cooler moving on from the
fitting<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.729> this<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.210> have<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.840> heat<00:04:29.020> pipe

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
fitting of this you have the heat pipe

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.050 
fitting of this you have the heat pipe
design<00:04:29.410> here

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
design here

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.850 
design here
to<00:04:30.150> directly<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.660> this<00:04:30.750> plate<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.590> course

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
to directly to this plate and of course

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.440 
to directly to this plate and of course
you<00:04:32.010> have<00:04:32.160> all<00:04:32.280> these<00:04:32.460> fins<00:04:32.790> which<00:04:33.210> are

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
you have all these fins which are

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.810 
you have all these fins which are
intended<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.139> keep<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.560> CPU<00:04:35.100> cooler<00:04:35.400> by

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
intended to keep the CPU cooler by

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.940 
intended to keep the CPU cooler by
dissipating<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.480> heat<00:04:36.570> generated<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.800> then

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
dissipating the heat generated and then

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.379 
dissipating the heat generated and then
transport<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.550> through<00:04:38.760> these<00:04:38.910> heat<00:04:39.120> pipes

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
transport you through these heat pipes

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.270 
transport you through these heat pipes
to<00:04:39.840> these<00:04:40.050> fins<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.919> course<00:04:41.130> you've<00:04:41.250> got

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
to these fins and of course you've got

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.100 
to these fins and of course you've got
the<00:04:41.370> fan<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.790> actually<00:04:42.090> cools<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:42.660> drugs

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
the fan that actually cools and drugs

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.870 
the fan that actually cools and drugs
air<00:04:43.350> through<00:04:43.740> these<00:04:43.950> fins<00:04:44.220> keeping<00:04:44.760> those

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
air through these fins keeping those

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.700 
air through these fins keeping those
cool<00:04:45.210> transferring<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.960> coolness<00:04:46.320> back<00:04:46.530> to

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
cool transferring the coolness back to

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.300 
cool transferring the coolness back to
the<00:04:46.800> CPU

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
the CPU

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.760 
the CPU
hence<00:04:47.639> keeping<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.210> cool<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:48.930> yeah<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.380> granted

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
hence keeping it cool so yeah it granted

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.260 
hence keeping it cool so yeah it granted
that<00:04:49.889> they<00:04:50.010> give<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.400> with<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:50.970> free

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that they give you this with it for free

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.540 
that they give you this with it for free
but<00:04:51.540> sir<00:04:51.900> no<00:04:52.230> thanks<00:04:52.680> because<00:04:52.830> actually<00:04:53.280> tried

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
but sir no thanks because actually tried

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.980 
but sir no thanks because actually tried
this<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:53.940> hence<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.300> reason<00:04:54.330> why<00:04:54.630> there's<00:04:54.810> no

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
this and hence the reason why there's no

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.680 
this and hence the reason why there's no
wear<00:04:55.260> thermal<00:04:55.680> paste<00:04:55.950> on<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.700> plate<00:04:57.389> there

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
wear thermal paste on the plate there

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.150 
wear thermal paste on the plate there
the<00:04:57.990> fact<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.290> I've<00:04:58.470> actually<00:04:58.590> tried<00:04:58.860> this

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
the fact that I've actually tried this

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.180 
the fact that I've actually tried this
on<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.430> CPU<00:05:00.000> when<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.210> got<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.750> is<00:05:01.530> basically

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
on the CPU when I got it is basically

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.270 
on the CPU when I got it is basically
it's<00:05:02.580> loud<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.330> it's<00:05:03.900> not<00:05:04.080> one<00:05:04.229> of<00:05:04.260> those<00:05:04.470> CPU

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
it's loud and it's not one of those CPU

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.100 
it's loud and it's not one of those CPU
coolers<00:05:05.639> that<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:06.030> basically<00:05:06.479> want<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.870> keep

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
coolers that you basically want to keep

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.659 
coolers that you basically want to keep
on<00:05:07.290> there<00:05:07.470> unless<00:05:07.860> of<00:05:08.010> course<00:05:08.040> you're<00:05:08.400> on<00:05:08.610> a

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
on there unless of course you're on a

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.850 
on there unless of course you're on a
very<00:05:08.850> tight<00:05:09.150> budget<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.600> can't<00:05:09.930> be<00:05:10.560> doing

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
very tight budget and can't be doing

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.190 
very tight budget and can't be doing
with<00:05:10.889> getting<00:05:11.669> another<00:05:12.060> CPU<00:05:12.389> cooler<00:05:12.990> just

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
with getting another CPU cooler just

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.960 
with getting another CPU cooler just
yeah<00:05:13.530> there<00:05:13.950> are<00:05:14.040> many<00:05:14.310> different<00:05:14.610> options

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
yeah there are many different options

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.210 
yeah there are many different options
out<00:05:15.120> there<00:05:15.450> for<00:05:15.479> CPU<00:05:16.139> coolers<00:05:16.530> not<00:05:16.710> only<00:05:16.919> can

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
out there for CPU coolers not only can

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.310 
out there for CPU coolers not only can
you<00:05:17.310> get<00:05:17.430> air<00:05:17.700> coolers<00:05:18.180> or<00:05:18.210> passive<00:05:18.840> coolers

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
you get air coolers or passive coolers

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.440 
you get air coolers or passive coolers
you<00:05:19.500> can<00:05:19.620> actually<00:05:19.830> get<00:05:20.130> water<00:05:20.790> coolers<00:05:21.270> these

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
you can actually get water coolers these

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.390 
you can actually get water coolers these
days<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.930> many<00:05:22.350> different<00:05:22.770> water<00:05:23.010> coolers

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
days and many different water coolers

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.180 
days and many different water coolers
