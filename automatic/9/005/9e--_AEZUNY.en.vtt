used cell phones for 10 years or more
they<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:50.879> finding<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> doubled<00:00:51.780> risk<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.199> brain

they are finding a doubled risk of brain

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750 
they are finding a doubled risk of brain
cancer<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> we're<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.100> concerned<00:00:53.460> about

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
cancer and we're very concerned about

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
cancer and we're very concerned about
that<00:00:53.940> yeah<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.930> tumors<00:00:55.350> especially

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that yeah what kind of tumors especially

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500 
that yeah what kind of tumors especially
are<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.160> looking<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> saying<00:00:56.940> there

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
are they looking at and saying there

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.910 
are they looking at and saying there
might<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.899> increased<00:00:58.350> risk<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.800> you're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
might be an increased risk if you're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.080 
might be an increased risk if you're
talking<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.430> cell<00:00:59.640> phone<00:00:59.820> all<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> time

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
talking on your cell phone all the time

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.569 
talking on your cell phone all the time
well<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.469> hold<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> phone<00:01:01.980> directly<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
well if you hold a phone directly to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
well if you hold a phone directly to
your<00:01:02.670> head<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.239> basically<00:01:03.680> microwaving

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
your head you're basically microwaving

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
your head you're basically microwaving
the<00:01:04.920> head<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> same<00:01:05.909> signal

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the head because that's the same signal

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.170 
the head because that's the same signal
strength

unfortunately<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.630> never<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.020> your

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
unfortunately you would never put your

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.390 
unfortunately you would never put your

not but if you're holding it close to
your<00:01:13.710> head<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.130> getting<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.700> signal<00:01:15.240> into

are<00:01:45.000> correct<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.930> time<00:01:46.259> but

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
are correct at this time but

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
are correct at this time but
unfortunately<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:47.399> they're<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.729> saying<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
unfortunately what they're not saying is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.569 
unfortunately what they're not saying is
that<00:01:48.810> almost<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.070> studies<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> have

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that almost all of the studies that have

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
that almost all of the studies that have

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
people who've used phones for less than

people who've used phones for less than
a<00:01:54.180> decade<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.860> unfortunately<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.159> start

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
a decade and unfortunately when we start

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.359 
a decade and unfortunately when we start
to<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.820> studies<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.450> longer<00:01:58.110> term<00:01:58.140> use<00:01:58.590> we're

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to see studies of longer term use we're

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069 
to see studies of longer term use we're
starting<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.850> see<00:01:59.880> an<00:02:00.210> increased<00:02:00.570> risk<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
starting to see an increased risk and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.870 
starting to see an increased risk and
the<00:02:01.170> question<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> would<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.159> play<00:02:02.460> Russian

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the question is would you play Russian

the question is would you play Russian
roulette<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.780> your<00:02:03.840> children's<00:02:04.350> brains

roulette with your children's brains
we're<00:02:05.250> particularly<00:02:05.640> concerned<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
we're particularly concerned because the

we're particularly concerned because the

forget<00:02:34.700> about<00:02:34.730> brain<00:02:35.180> cancer<00:02:35.630> let's<00:02:35.810> just

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
forget about brain cancer let's just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.350 
forget about brain cancer let's just
talk<00:02:36.230> about<00:02:36.260> learning<00:02:37.010> problems<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.730> other

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
talk about learning problems and other

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.000 
talk about learning problems and other
issues<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.900> our<00:02:38.990> children<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.590> fact<00:02:39.860> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
issues of our children and the fact that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.790 
issues of our children and the fact that
brains<00:02:40.760> continue<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.660> grow<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.290> develop<00:02:42.350> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
brains continue to grow and develop and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.530 
brains continue to grow and develop and
we<00:02:42.920> know<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.790> brain<00:02:43.970> doesn't<00:02:44.210> fully

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
we know that the brain doesn't fully

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.440 
we know that the brain doesn't fully
mature<00:02:44.960> until<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:46.070> early<00:02:46.460> 20s<00:02:46.820> okay<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.240> it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
mature until the early 20s okay so it

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.090 
mature until the early 20s okay so it
just<00:02:47.690> seems<00:02:47.870> obvious<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.470> me<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.800> if<00:02:48.920> you're

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
just seems obvious to me that if you're

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.560 
just seems obvious to me that if you're
holding<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.550> cell<00:02:49.760> phone<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.090> head<00:02:50.330> and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
holding a cell phone to your head and

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.500 
holding a cell phone to your head and
it's<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:51.200> emitting<00:02:51.770> radiation<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.240> we<00:02:53.330> know

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
it's it's emitting radiation and we know

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.210 
it's it's emitting radiation and we know
that<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.870> that's<00:02:54.320> how<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> signal<00:02:55.040> goes

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that that that's how the signal goes

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.770 
that that that's how the signal goes
even<00:02:55.760> Bluetooth<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.390> little<00:02:56.570> Bluetooth

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
earpieces emit signals that reach to
