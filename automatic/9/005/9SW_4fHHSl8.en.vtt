thought that possibly people could learn

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.230 
thought that possibly people could learn
from<00:01:12.110> my<00:01:12.290> mistakes<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:12.950> avoid<00:01:13.430> them<00:01:13.729> because

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
from my mistakes and avoid them because

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.330 
from my mistakes and avoid them because
I<00:01:14.270> have<00:01:14.540> now<00:01:14.780> been<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.200> blogging<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:16.040> this

some of the mistakes that I made with my

some of the mistakes that I made with my
young<00:01:34.159> dreads<00:01:34.429> so<00:01:34.820> despite<00:01:35.359> all<00:01:35.390> those

young dreads so despite all those
mistakes<00:01:36.109> I<00:01:36.920> have<00:01:37.369> arrived<00:01:37.729> at<00:01:37.939> seven<00:01:38.270> years<00:01:38.509> I

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
mistakes I have arrived at seven years I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.630 
mistakes I have arrived at seven years I
have<00:01:38.770> lasted<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.009> long

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
have lasted this long

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.060 
have lasted this long
my<00:01:40.909> hair<00:01:41.240> has<00:01:41.479> lasted<00:01:41.960> this<00:01:42.109> long<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.679> this<00:01:42.950> is

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
my hair has lasted this long and this is

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.249 
my hair has lasted this long and this is
where<00:01:43.219> we're<00:01:43.369> at<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.030> how<00:01:44.479> my<00:01:44.719> hair<00:01:44.990> looks

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
where we're at this is how my hair looks

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.889 
where we're at this is how my hair looks
after<00:01:45.469> seven<00:01:46.249> years<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:47.179> was<00:01:47.359> left<00:01:47.659> of

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
after seven years and this was left of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.260 
after seven years and this was left of
it<00:01:48.020> after<00:01:48.170> seven<00:01:48.649> years<00:01:48.679> so<00:01:49.249> this<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:49.969> probably

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
it after seven years so this is probably

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.029 
it after seven years so this is probably
the<00:01:50.390> longest<00:01:50.539> I've<00:01:50.869> ever<00:01:51.049> had<00:01:51.289> them<00:01:51.560> people

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
the longest I've ever had them people

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.440 
the longest I've ever had them people
who've<00:01:52.280> been<00:01:52.399> viewing<00:01:52.729> my<00:01:52.820> channel<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:53.390> a

who've been viewing my channel for a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.599 
who've been viewing my channel for a
while<00:01:53.570> will<00:01:54.229> know<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.950> not<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
while will know that this is not the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.580 
while will know that this is not the
entire<00:01:56.210> length<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.719> hair<00:01:56.929> that<00:01:57.109> I've<00:01:57.200> ever<00:01:57.320> had

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
entire length of hair that I've ever had

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.789 
entire length of hair that I've ever had
I<00:01:57.799> have<00:01:58.219> cut<00:01:58.670> my<00:01:59.030> hair<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.509> few<00:02:00.079> times<00:02:00.380> over<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
I have cut my hair a few times over the

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.620 
I have cut my hair a few times over the
seven<00:02:01.100> years<00:02:01.340> whether<00:02:01.939> that<00:02:02.329> sort<00:02:02.539> of

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
seven years whether that sort of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.410 
seven years whether that sort of
diminishes<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.979> seven<00:02:04.429> years<00:02:04.880> because<00:02:05.390> you

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
diminishes the seven years because you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.050 
diminishes the seven years because you
know<00:02:05.719> technically<00:02:06.439> this<00:02:07.219> hair<00:02:07.520> wasn't<00:02:07.729> around

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
know technically this hair wasn't around

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.730 
know technically this hair wasn't around
seven<00:02:08.360> years<00:02:08.539> ago<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.810> guess<00:02:09.080> because<00:02:09.259> if<00:02:09.470> stuff

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
seven years ago I guess because if stuff

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.520 
seven years ago I guess because if stuff
was<00:02:09.950> cut<00:02:10.460> off<00:02:10.490> but<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.600> can't<00:02:11.930> say<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.440> I've

wax which at the time sent like the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.890

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
is the way to do it and then Asylum says

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.730 
is the way to do it and then Asylum says
this<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> way<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.660> do<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.200> your<00:03:05.590> mom

says you're gonna trust the salon and
that's<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> way<00:03:08.680> things<00:03:09.100> tend<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.580> go<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.240> all

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
that's the way things tend to go so all

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.510 
that's the way things tend to go so all
that<00:03:11.080> length<00:03:11.260> did<00:03:11.710> have<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.070> be<00:03:12.190> removed

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
that length did have to be removed

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.270 
that length did have to be removed
because<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.240> did<00:03:13.570> not<00:03:13.600> progress<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:15.130> way

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
because it just did not progress the way

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.790 
because it just did not progress the way
that<00:03:15.850> hair<00:03:16.180> should<00:03:16.720> really<00:03:17.170> progress<00:03:17.560> into

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
that hair should really progress into

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.830 
that hair should really progress into
locks<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.700> while<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.120> sad<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.540> lose<00:03:19.660> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
locks so while it was sad to lose the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.810 
locks so while it was sad to lose the
length<00:03:20.080> I'm<00:03:20.680> really<00:03:20.980> happy<00:03:21.130> with<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> results

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
length I'm really happy with the results

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.200 
length I'm really happy with the results

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
pretty good positive run at the moment

there have been times over the seven

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
years when I was kind of being at my

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.110 
years when I was kind of being at my
limit<00:05:50.470> with<00:05:50.500> them<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:50.950> seriously<00:05:51.580> considered

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
limit with them and seriously considered

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.150 
limit with them and seriously considered
putting<00:05:52.450> them<00:05:52.570> off<00:05:52.690> but<00:05:52.990> just<00:05:53.200> didn't<00:05:53.890> have<00:05:54.010> to

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
putting them off but just didn't have to

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.920 
putting them off but just didn't have to
be<00:05:54.280> within<00:05:54.460> sort<00:05:54.970> of<00:05:55.030> arm's<00:05:55.270> reach<00:05:55.390> of

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
be within sort of arm's reach of

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.450 
be within sort of arm's reach of
scissors<00:05:56.590> but<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:56.920> really<00:05:57.160> haven't<00:05:57.310> thought

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
scissors but I really haven't thought

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.010 
scissors but I really haven't thought
about<00:05:57.730> removing<00:05:57.910> them<00:05:58.390> since<00:05:58.660> I<00:05:58.780> started
