now<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.900> astronauts<00:00:01.380> did<00:00:01.530> not<00:00:01.680> go<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
now the astronauts did not go to the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.100 
now the astronauts did not go to the
moon<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.550> take<00:00:02.760> pictures<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.540> sky<00:00:03.780> they

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.630 
moon to take pictures of the sky they
went<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> moon<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.740> take<00:00:04.890> pictures<00:00:05.190> yeah

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
went to the moon to take pictures yeah

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.579 
went to the moon to take pictures yeah
of<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.029> moon<00:00:06.210> right<00:00:06.690> why<00:00:07.049> should<00:00:07.080> they<00:00:07.440> be

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
of the moon right why should they be

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.890 
of the moon right why should they be
concerned<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.160> all<00:00:08.280> with<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.849> Stars<00:00:09.179> they

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
concerned at all with the Stars they

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.990 
concerned at all with the Stars they
knew<00:00:10.230> what<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.679> Stars<00:00:10.980> looked<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.519> already

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
knew what the Stars looked like already

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.049 
knew what the Stars looked like already
they<00:00:12.630> were<00:00:12.660> there<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.320> study<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.040> moon<00:00:14.340> that

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
they were there to study the moon that

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.050 
they were there to study the moon that
was<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> whole<00:00:15.870> point<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.800> study<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
was the whole point of going study the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.420 
was the whole point of going study the
moon<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.650> Stars<00:00:21.020> in<00:00:22.020> debate<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:23.220> been

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
moon not the Stars in debate I have been

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670 
moon not the Stars in debate I have been
told<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> nothing<00:00:24.930> special<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.470> gain

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
told so there is nothing special to gain

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920 
told so there is nothing special to gain
from<00:00:26.189> putting<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.550> telescope<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.240> moon<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
from putting a telescope on the moon and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.700 
from putting a telescope on the moon and
that's<00:00:28.619> why<00:00:28.890> none<00:00:29.189> were<00:00:29.340> taken<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> polo<00:00:30.710> yet

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that's why none were taken on a polo yet

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.220 
that's why none were taken on a polo yet

maybe<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.950> prep<00:00:44.190> again<00:00:44.430> should<00:00:44.700> tell<00:00:44.940> cook

maybe the prep again should tell cook

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
maybe the prep again should tell cook
