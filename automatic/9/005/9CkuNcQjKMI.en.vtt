00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.990 
kool-aid acid test and since I'd read
the<00:02:47.270> book<00:02:47.800> I'd<00:02:48.800> always<00:02:48.980> wanted<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.520> drive<00:02:49.970> a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
the book I'd always wanted to drive a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.070 
the book I'd always wanted to drive a
bus<00:02:50.240> across<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.720> country<00:02:51.080> myself

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.200 

so<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> took<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.220> wheel<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.790> was<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.970> dream

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
so when I took the wheel it was a dream

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.490 
so when I took the wheel it was a dream
come<00:02:57.480> true<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.460> what<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.490> trip<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> was<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:01.230> bus

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
come true and what a trip it was the bus

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.190 
come true and what a trip it was the bus
could<00:03:02.070> go<00:03:02.190> no<00:03:02.400> faster<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:03.060> 50<00:03:03.570> miles<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
could go no faster than 50 miles up the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.850 
could go no faster than 50 miles up the
mountains<00:03:05.930> then<00:03:06.930> once<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.290> crusted<00:03:07.740> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
mountains then once you crusted the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.880 
mountains then once you crusted the
mountain<00:03:08.480> you'd<00:03:09.480> be<00:03:09.600> going<00:03:09.870> 60<00:03:10.320> miles<00:03:10.500> per

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
mountain you'd be going 60 miles per

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.210 
mountain you'd be going 60 miles per
hour<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:12.440> 20,000<00:03:13.440> pounds<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.950> bus

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
hour with 20,000 pounds of bus

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.260 
hour with 20,000 pounds of bus
underneath<00:03:14.760> you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
underneath you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.140 
underneath you
barreling<00:03:15.750> down<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.020> mountain<00:03:16.860> all<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
barreling down the mountain all the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.630 
barreling down the mountain all the
while<00:03:18.360> trying<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.230> not<00:03:19.590> overheat<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.430> thing

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
while trying to not overheat the thing

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.770 
while trying to not overheat the thing
so<00:03:20.820> we'd<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.210> pull<00:03:21.420> over<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.870> stop<00:03:22.170> I

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
so we'd have to pull over and stop I

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.310 
so we'd have to pull over and stop I
loved<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
loved it

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.850 
loved it
a<00:03:26.900> lot<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.020> people<00:03:28.350> when<00:03:28.440> they're<00:03:28.590> driving

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
a lot of people when they're driving

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.370 
a lot of people when they're driving
just<00:03:29.610> want<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> get<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.600> where<00:03:31.020> they're<00:03:31.170> trying

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380

enjoy<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.560> ride

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050
