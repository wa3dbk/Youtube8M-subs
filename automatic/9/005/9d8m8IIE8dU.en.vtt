merely one of the commands and then

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.800 
merely one of the commands and then
there<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.820> commands<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.570> there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
there are more commands and then there

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 
there are more commands and then there
are<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.200> command<00:02:07.649> blocks<00:02:07.920> over<00:02:08.220> here

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
are all the command blocks over here

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.600 
are all the command blocks over here
which<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.000> believe<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.200> doing<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
which I believe are just doing all of

which I believe are just doing all of
the<00:02:11.910> armor<00:02:12.390> stand<00:02:12.450> pair

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the armor stand pair

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.790 
the armor stand pair
and<00:02:13.890> making<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.569> all<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.870> parts<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.650> bike

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and making the all the parts of the bike

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.920 
and making the all the parts of the bike
move<00:02:17.069> around<00:02:17.430> as<00:02:17.970> you're<00:02:18.209> riding<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.720> horse

it's<00:02:20.390> complicated<00:02:21.390> stuff<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:23.069> all<00:02:23.159> works

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's complicated stuff but it all works

slide<00:03:32.170> cousin<00:03:32.530> how<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.709> board<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
slide cousin how the board just a

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.600 
slide cousin how the board just a
motorcycle<00:03:33.700> okay<00:03:34.630> here<00:03:34.810> we<00:03:34.870> go<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.519> 360<00:03:36.519> over

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
motorcycle okay here we go and 360 over

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.089 
motorcycle okay here we go and 360 over
jump<00:03:36.880> number<00:03:36.970> one<00:03:37.239> boom<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:38.560> let's<00:03:38.950> do<00:03:39.069> a

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
jump number one boom and let's do a

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.640 
jump number one boom and let's do a
little<00:03:39.250> bat<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.030> then<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.299> little<00:03:40.450> 180<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.019> fell

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
little bat and then a little 180 I fell

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.030 
little bat and then a little 180 I fell
off<00:03:41.819> points<00:03:42.819> deducted<00:03:43.269> not<00:03:44.200> good<00:03:44.530> hold<00:03:44.920> on

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
off points deducted not good hold on

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.470 
off points deducted not good hold on
let's<00:03:45.220> see<00:03:45.280> if<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:45.489> can<00:03:45.610> do<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.730> little<00:03:46.030> little

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
let's see if we can do a little little
