00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 the use of proprietary components for 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 use an x86 processor similar to the one 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 can be found on a pc the ps3 has 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.550
 a chip designed in conjunction with ibm and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.820

 360 and the wii 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.400

 called hardware runs and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.940

 rigid but did not clarify his ability 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.860
 you will also have a blu-ray reader 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.830
 although the focus of buying games 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.930
 will be in the sony online store 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.300
 graphic processor built-in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 central as is the tendency of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.580
 latest processors for pc processes 1.8 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.710
 teraflops that is billions of 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
 floating point instructions by 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 second and allows models with 30,000 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.509
 polygons on screen as it showed 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 jong game tube source 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.250
 about twice as much as he could 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.320
 achieve the ps3 the polygons are used to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.950
 generate the 3d models that are seen in 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.830
 screen 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.289
 the signature quantic dreams showed in the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.780
 presentation human heads high 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.780
 realism with even more polygons 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.250
 bad news for users 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.680
 historical playstation is that by 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.979
 now the ps3 games will not run on 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.230
 the ps4 does not have the user in his 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.390
 home at least since the two 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.150
 devices have architectures of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.709
 different processor if it will be possible 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.239
 play ps1 ps2 and ps3 titles 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.580
 stored in the cloud as on live and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.250
 how he proposed envy at the beginning of the year 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.830
 will be via streaming the game is hosted in 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.680
 an online server the user receives the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.560
 video and send the commands and try a 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.269
 game instantly without need 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.489
 wait for it to be downloaded 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.080
 complete if the internet connection is 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.870
 adequate clear is the ps4 also has 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.150
 a new controller the dualshock 4 with 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.310
 a touch pad in the middle and buttons 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.319
 social networks to share online what the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.630
 player is doing with a lot 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.660
 presence of social networks that of sony and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.550
 the traditional the gamepad has its 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.340
 own speaker and connector for 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.130
 headphones besides keeping led that 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.860
 illuminates with the color that 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.200
 to a character on screen to help 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.350
 the user to understand which character is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.720
 active at what time and also account 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.730
 with a 3d camera that identifies the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.430
 users sitting in front of the screen 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.500
 both to identify themselves before the team 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.630
 by face recognition as for 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.460
 control the game with movements to 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.450
 kinect style although the company 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.730
 will keep your inertial controls 9 sony 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.990
 this head to head in sales with the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.300
 xbox 360 with the ps4 hopes to redouble the 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.670
 bet and stay current in a world 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.890
 the one of the videojuegos that it has every time 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.670
 more presence of mobile devices 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.130
 like smartphones and tablets at the end of the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.380
 presentation the surprise they took it 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.870
 those present the company did not show the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.060
 team not even a glimpse nor gave 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.190
 certain dates about their arrival at 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.100
 international markets or a price 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.890
 estimated at the beginning of the year casiraghi 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.200
 the zombie boss had already clarified that 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.020
 would let microsoft was the first step 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.640
 that is, it will announce its console first 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.890
 but the call to the press 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.790
 made me assume that they have a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.209
 precisions 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.400
 maybe he is planting flag as he is 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.370
 we will have to wait to really know 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.320
 what brings the ps4 good is what has 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.360
 shown today are and in new york that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.840
 I hope they subscribe I say goodbye 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.840
 goodbye
