00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.210
 as the power of god jesus in the holy spirit 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.760
 with one person if the bible rosita 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.020
 so that the tall individual most of the time 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.819
 How does that person stay? 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.429
 really 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:22.449
 god the father jesus christ holy spirit are not a single person there is a framework 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.599
 I have my call 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.550
 who teaches the following that exist communicated to be activity 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.930
 and that he appeared 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.429
 as father at the time of history 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.790
 later he appeared as son another moment in history 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.970
 and then appeared as holy spirit 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.450
 this theory followed by some religious groups is totally flawed 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.530
 by the following 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.940
 god is a success 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.380
 that appeared during the story 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.440
 in three different ways 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.580
 how do we suppose for example that jesus lived 11 7 was looking at 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.520
 himself 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.610
 chris forró so in the benfica my father with the glory that the youth team before 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.030
 that there was world 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.320
 joão 17 5 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 already thought if the crisis was praying for himself 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.670
 glorified ii 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.009
 myself with the glory I took to kunming with me before there was a world 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.420
 it would be absurd 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 then the bible would mention in which the three people the dignity are people 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.220
 different 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.420
 now deuteronomy 6d only 4 states that there is only one god 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 not in the numerical sense 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.899
 but in the sense of 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.899
 Truth is the only true god. 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.050
 compound 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.180
 by three persons to a dignity of age composed of three persons 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.940
 God is a show 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.850
 in power in the proposed but different plan character 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.350
 have personality read for example baptism of christ and mateus 3 13 to 17 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.970
 and you'll see Dad talking 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.719
 christ being baptized 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.179
 and the holy spirit in the year of crisis was yet another cup 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.899
 so the bible leaves no doubt 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.519
 really be the three persons of the deity are distinct 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.880
 and that each has 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.680
 a different function 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 in the plan of salvation 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.800
 and also in the creation of our planet
