directory<00:00:42.270> partition<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.219> we're

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
directory partition right now so we're

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.590 
directory partition right now so we're
going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> make<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:46.280> another<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> do

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
going to make a a another one so to do

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.220 
going to make a a another one so to do
that<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.870> got<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> pull<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.350> command<00:00:52.710> line<00:00:52.920> run

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
that we got to pull up command line run

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.610 
that we got to pull up command line run
CMD<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.750> command<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> use

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
CMD and the command we're going to use

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.690 
CMD and the command we're going to use
is<00:01:00.230> dns<00:01:01.609> CMD<00:01:03.650> specify<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> name<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is dns CMD specify the name of the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
is dns CMD specify the name of the
server<00:01:05.970> which<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.100> name<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.280> server<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
server which the name of my server is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.410 
server which the name of my server is
server<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:12.110> dot<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:14.760> belongs<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
server one dot and it belongs in the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.410 
server one dot and it belongs in the
first<00:01:15.659> domain<00:01:16.350> domain<00:01:17.090> first<00:01:18.090> dot<00:01:19.369> domain<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
first domain domain first dot domain and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:33.580 
first domain domain first dot domain and
the<00:01:22.880> switch<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:25.369> create<00:01:27.979> directory<00:01:30.560> partition

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.060 

and<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> name<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> directory

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and then I name what the directory

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.690 
and then I name what the directory
partition<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.810> we'll<00:01:40.140> use

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
partition is going to be so we'll use

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:54.850 
partition is going to be so we'll use
imaginary<00:01:42.829> dot<00:01:43.829> first<00:01:44.899> dot<00:01:46.640> domain

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.810 

so<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> created<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.750> partition<00:01:58.580> here<00:01:59.580> right

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so it created the partition here right

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.770 
so it created the partition here right
click<00:02:00.000> properties<00:02:01.370> replication<00:02:02.370> change<00:02:02.970> so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
click properties replication change so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.570 
click properties replication change so
now<00:02:03.900> i<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.020> choose<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.440> all<00:02:04.980> domain

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
now i can choose to all domain

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.570 
now i can choose to all domain
controllers<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.500> partition<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.430> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
controllers in this partition this is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.320 
controllers in this partition this is
important<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> allows<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.720> segment<00:02:11.330> domain

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
important it allows me to segment domain

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.480 
important it allows me to segment domain
controllers<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.110> dns<00:02:13.440> servers<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.460> that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
controllers and dns servers so that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.550

wanted to replicate to half of my domain
controllers<00:02:22.110> i<00:02:22.320> could<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> similar<00:02:24.180> command

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
controllers i could do a similar command

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.820

it's<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> give<00:02:44.280> me<00:02:44.340> an<00:02:44.430> error<00:02:44.490> message

imaginary<00:02:55.160> partition<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.170> an
