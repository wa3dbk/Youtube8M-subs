thing's pretty cool I should see if I

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.540 
thing's pretty cool I should see if I
can<00:00:09.750> beat<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.290> spent<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.769> half<00:00:11.040> hour

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
can beat it and I spent like half hour

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.030 
can beat it and I spent like half hour
playing<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.330> couldn't<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:13.650> by<00:00:13.860> like

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
playing it and I couldn't just by like

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.379 
playing it and I couldn't just by like
messing<00:00:14.370> around<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.940> couldn't<00:00:15.210> beat

messing around with it I couldn't beat
it<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.690> then<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.139> stopped<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:16.890> actually

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
it so then I stopped and like actually

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.960 
it so then I stopped and like actually
just<00:00:17.550> thought<00:00:18.150> about<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:19.020> an<00:00:19.260> hour<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
just thought about it for an hour and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.279 
just thought about it for an hour and
came<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.240> solution<00:00:21.570> actually<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.420> ie

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
came up with a solution actually so ie

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
came up with a solution actually so ie
what<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> try<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.820> prove<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
what I'm going to try to prove to you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
what I'm going to try to prove to you
guys<00:00:27.390> today<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.289> thing<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.740> always<00:00:29.099> be

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
guys today that this thing can always be

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.490 
guys today that this thing can always be
solved<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:31.430> ninety<00:00:32.719> ninety<00:00:33.719> eight<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.170> less

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
solved in a ninety ninety eight or less

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.780 
solved in a ninety ninety eight or less
moves<00:00:34.890> oh<00:00:35.280> sorry<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:36.630> that's<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
moves oh sorry that's not right that's a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.990 
moves oh sorry that's not right that's a
less<00:00:38.790> than<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.120> should<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:40.760> ninety<00:00:41.760> moves

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
less than that should be ninety moves

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
less than that should be ninety moves
yeah<00:00:42.719> ninety<00:00:43.170> moves<00:00:43.730> or<00:00:44.730> less<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> I'm<00:00:47.039> going

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
yeah ninety moves or less so I'm going

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910 
yeah ninety moves or less so I'm going
to<00:00:47.219> break<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.610> into<00:00:47.730> two<00:00:47.879> steps<00:00:48.920> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to break this up into two steps this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180 
to break this up into two steps this
little<00:00:50.370> diagram<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.210> step<00:00:51.420> two<00:00:52.190> for

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
little diagram here is for step two for

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590 
little diagram here is for step two for
step<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
step one what we're going to do is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.229 
step one what we're going to do is
simply<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.559> start<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.789> row<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> buttons

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
simply go start with this row of buttons

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.080 
simply go start with this row of buttons
here<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.489> top<00:00:59.820> row<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
here and just get the very top row to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.860 
here and just get the very top row to
all<00:01:00.359> green

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
all green

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.680 
all green
so<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.680> degree<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:03.120> screen<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so that degree in that screen there you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
so that degree in that screen there you
go<00:01:03.840> by<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> way<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.830> you've<00:01:04.949> never<00:01:05.070> seen<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
go by the way if you've never seen this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
go by the way if you've never seen this
game<00:01:05.640> before<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> works<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.659> uh<00:01:06.810> if

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
game before the way it works is uh if

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.940 
game before the way it works is uh if
you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.650> hit<00:01:08.100> any<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.549> buttons<00:01:08.930> it'll

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
you can hit any of these buttons it'll

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
you can hit any of these buttons it'll
switch<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.189> colors<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.880> button<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.049> four

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
switch the colors of button and the four

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.330 
switch the colors of button and the four
blocks<00:01:13.439> next<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:16.189> alright<00:01:17.189> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
blocks next to it like that alright so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.130 
blocks next to it like that alright so
then<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.299> I'll<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
then going on here then I'll get the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.100 
then going on here then I'll get the
second<00:01:19.650> row<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.549> green<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
second row to all green I'm just kind of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.770 
second row to all green I'm just kind of
doing<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
doing that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.750 
doing that
and<00:01:24.590> I'm<00:01:24.800> going<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.010> do<00:01:25.130> this<00:01:25.250> all<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.520> way

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
and I'm going to do this all the way

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.420 
and I'm going to do this all the way
down<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.420> bottom<00:01:26.650> until<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.980> have<00:01:28.130> one

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
down to the bottom until I just have one

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.090 
down to the bottom until I just have one
row<00:01:28.640> at<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.820> very<00:01:29.090> bottom<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:30.710> has<00:01:30.890> some

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
row at the very bottom that has some

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.780 
row at the very bottom that has some
pink<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:32.260> so<00:01:33.260> this<00:01:33.470> step<00:01:33.790> theoretically

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
pink in it so this step theoretically

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.900 
pink in it so this step theoretically
since<00:01:35.660> uh<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:37.180> start<00:01:38.380> at<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.130> second<00:01:40.610> two<00:01:40.700> top

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
since uh you start at the second two top

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.450 
since uh you start at the second two top
row<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.390> end<00:01:42.050> on<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.350> bottom<00:01:42.500> room<00:01:42.860> there's

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
row and end on the bottom room there's

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.760 
row and end on the bottom room there's
seven<00:01:43.970> times<00:01:44.210> eight<00:01:44.750> different<00:01:45.320> buttons<00:01:45.619> you

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
seven times eight different buttons you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.460 
seven times eight different buttons you
can<00:01:45.800> hit<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.280> let's<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.610> say<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:48.050> can

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
can hit so let's just say it you can

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.560 
can hit so let's just say it you can
probably<00:01:48.650> prove<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.130> would<00:01:49.880> never<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.390> to

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
probably prove this would never have to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.030 
probably prove this would never have to
be<00:01:50.690> true<00:01:50.900> but<00:01:51.140> let's<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:51.470> say<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.680> have<00:01:51.860> to

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
be true but let's just say you have to

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.080 
be true but let's just say you have to
hit<00:01:52.220> all<00:01:55.899> 56<00:01:56.899> buttons<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.710> let's<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:58.850> say

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
hit all 56 buttons so let's just say

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.550 
hit all 56 buttons so let's just say
it's<00:01:59.300> theoretically<00:01:59.810> possible<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.410> actually

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's theoretically possible to actually

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.469 
it's theoretically possible to actually
have<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.040> hit<00:02:01.190> 56<00:02:01.790> buttons<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.670> next<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:05.330> that

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
have to hit 56 buttons so next now that

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.719 
have to hit 56 buttons so next now that
we're<00:02:05.720> left<00:02:05.869> with<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.140> last<00:02:06.350> row<00:02:06.680> here<00:02:07.009> this

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
we're left with this last row here this

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.090 
we're left with this last row here this
is<00:02:07.970> where<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.270> going<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.479> use<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:09.440> diagram

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
is where I'm going to use this diagram

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.470 
is where I'm going to use this diagram
here<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:12.820> I'll<00:02:13.820> do<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> quick<00:02:14.209> demonstration

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
here so I'll do a quick demonstration

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.440 
here so I'll do a quick demonstration
with<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.959> diagram<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.239> like

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
with a diagram but this is kind of like

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.880 
with a diagram but this is kind of like
where<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> had<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.200> think<00:02:18.350> about<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.709> for<00:02:18.830> a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
where I had to think about it for a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.490 
where I had to think about it for a
while<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.070> figured<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.790> out<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:23.050> I'll<00:02:24.050> use

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
while and figured this out so I'll use

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.910 
while and figured this out so I'll use
the<00:02:25.480> second<00:02:26.480> button<00:02:26.660> here<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.959> demonstrate<00:02:27.320> or

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
the second button here to demonstrate or

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.990 
the second button here to demonstrate or
the<00:02:28.070> third<00:02:28.280> button<00:02:28.489> here<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.820> demonstrate

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
the third button here to demonstrate

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.720 
the third button here to demonstrate
this<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.560> fact<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:30.980> button<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.340> 3in

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
this so the fact that this button is 3in

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.120 
this so the fact that this button is 3in
means<00:02:32.060> i<00:02:32.299> should<00:02:32.570> start<00:02:32.870> with<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.769> button

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
means i should start with this button

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.020 
means i should start with this button
right<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:36.280> what's<00:02:37.280> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.459> happen<00:02:37.880> is

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
right here and what's going to happen is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.320 
right here and what's going to happen is
these<00:02:38.570> three<00:02:39.110> blocks<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.760> bottom<00:02:40.940> edge

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
these three blocks on the bottom edge

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.449 
these three blocks on the bottom edge
there<00:02:41.630> are<00:02:41.870> going<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.200> get<00:02:42.380> switched<00:02:42.799> if<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
there are going to get switched if I

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.150 
there are going to get switched if I
start<00:02:43.760> on<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.450> third<00:02:44.660> button<00:02:44.900> here<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.350> do

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
start on the third button here and do

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.910 
start on the third button here and do
what<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.370> just<00:02:46.670> showed<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.030> guys<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:48.650> only

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
ended up spending a lot of time thinking

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.110

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
remember that before this thing was all

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.150 
remember that before this thing was all
these<00:03:20.420> pink<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:21.020> now<00:03:21.170> these<00:03:21.440> three<00:03:21.920> have

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
these pink but now these three have

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.070 
these pink but now these three have
gotten<00:03:22.489> switched<00:03:22.819> right<00:03:23.390> here<00:03:23.600> these<00:03:23.780> three

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
gotten switched right here these three

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.540 
gotten switched right here these three
green<00:03:24.380> were<00:03:24.560> switched<00:03:24.920> because<00:03:25.069> they<00:03:25.250> used<00:03:25.430> to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
green were switched because they used to

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.110 
green were switched because they used to
be<00:03:25.670> pink

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
be pink

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.910 
be pink
well<00:03:26.600> if<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.780> look<00:03:26.900> at<00:03:27.020> a<00:03:27.050> diagram<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:27.500> these

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
well if we look at a diagram here these

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.400 
well if we look at a diagram here these
three<00:03:28.370> are<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.480> ones<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.810> got<00:03:30.020> switched

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
three are the ones that got switched

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.970 
three are the ones that got switched
because<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.370> started<00:03:31.640> with<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.850> button<00:03:32.980> so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
because we started with this button so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.030 
because we started with this button so
now<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.519> can<00:03:35.480> go<00:03:35.660> ahead<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.290> see<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.830> oh

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
now I can go ahead and see like oh

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.130 
now I can go ahead and see like oh
there's<00:03:37.340> four<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.820> these<00:03:37.940> left<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:40.390> if<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
there's four of these left so if and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.780 
there's four of these left so if and
that<00:03:42.170> matches<00:03:42.650> up<00:03:42.950> with<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.310> line<00:03:43.550> right

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
that matches up with this line right

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.640 
that matches up with this line right
here<00:03:43.850> therefore<00:03:44.660> if<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.110> start<00:03:45.380> with<00:03:45.410> this

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
here therefore if I start with this

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.040 
here therefore if I start with this
button<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.069> fourth<00:03:46.310> one<00:03:46.550> in<00:03:49.480> now<00:03:50.480> if<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.810> just

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
button the fourth one in now if I just

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.390 
button the fourth one in now if I just
kind<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.319> hit<00:03:51.440> these<00:03:51.560> buttons<00:03:51.769> bring<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.280> all

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
kind of hit these buttons bring it all

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.840 
kind of hit these buttons bring it all
the<00:03:52.430> way<00:03:52.550> down<00:03:53.830> try<00:03:54.830> to<00:03:54.860> do<00:03:55.069> this<00:03:55.250> quickly<00:03:55.489> I

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
the way down try to do this quickly I

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.720 
the way down try to do this quickly I
should<00:03:56.810> be<00:03:56.930> able<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.260> solve<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.620> puzzle<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.480> I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
should be able to solve the puzzle and I

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.830 
should be able to solve the puzzle and I
wasn't<00:04:01.730> counting<00:04:01.850> my<00:04:02.120> moves<00:04:02.330> on<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.630> first

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
wasn't counting my moves on the first

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.289 
wasn't counting my moves on the first
part<00:04:03.110> but<00:04:03.319> let's<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.650> I'll<00:04:03.890> just<00:04:04.160> say<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.150> was

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
part but let's just I'll just say it was

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.319 
part but let's just I'll just say it was
about<00:04:05.480> 32<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:08.380> believe<00:04:09.459> this<00:04:10.459> one<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.090> first

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
about 32 I believe this one the first

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.390 
about 32 I believe this one the first
button<00:04:11.570> takes<00:04:11.750> 24<00:04:12.560> moves<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.980> do<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.190> one

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
button takes 24 moves to do this one

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.080 
button takes 24 moves to do this one
takes<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:15.650> one<00:04:15.829> takes<00:04:16.010> 22<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.729> one<00:04:16.910> takes

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
takes this one takes 22 this one takes

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.310 
takes this one takes 22 this one takes
24<00:04:17.660> 23<00:04:18.260> 22<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.190> or<00:04:19.970> 24<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:20.840> we<00:04:20.959> just<00:04:21.109> did<00:04:21.260> another

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
24 23 22 so or 24 so we just did another

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.340 
24 23 22 so or 24 so we just did another
47<00:04:22.070> moves<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:24.620> there<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:24.979> a<00:04:25.010> way<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.370> make<00:04:25.820> this

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
47 moves but there is a way to make this

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.020 
47 moves but there is a way to make this
step<00:04:27.350> 2<00:04:27.650> using<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.220> diagram<00:04:28.640> go<00:04:28.789> even<00:04:29.090> faster

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
step 2 using this diagram go even faster

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.430 
step 2 using this diagram go even faster
and<00:04:32.030> I'll<00:04:32.150> show<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.390> guys<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.840> in<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.080> second

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
and I'll show you guys that in a second

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.990 
and I'll show you guys that in a second
all<00:04:33.919> right<00:04:34.039> there<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.220> go<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.700> puzzles

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
all right there you go so the puzzles

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.170 
all right there you go so the puzzles
solved<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.919> way<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.490> can<00:04:37.610> go<00:04:37.700> faster<00:04:38.060> is

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
solved the way that it can go faster is

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.550 
solved the way that it can go faster is
from<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.479> list<00:04:38.600> that<00:04:38.660> time<00:04:38.900> what<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.050> did<00:04:39.200> was<00:04:39.380> I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
from the list that time what I did was I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.590 
from the list that time what I did was I
did<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.340> third<00:04:40.550> button<00:04:40.760> brought<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.120> down<00:04:41.270> and

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
did the third button brought it down and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.850 
did the third button brought it down and
then<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.870> started<00:04:42.140> with<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.350> fourth<00:04:42.560> button

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
then I started with the fourth button

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.279 
then I started with the fourth button
and<00:04:43.010> brought<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.370> down<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.600> only<00:04:45.080> did

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
and brought that down and I only did

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.740 
and brought that down and I only did
this<00:04:45.410> separately<00:04:45.890> in<00:04:46.190> order<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.729> like<00:04:46.910> kind<00:04:47.660> of

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
this separately in order to like kind of

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.930 
this separately in order to like kind of
help<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:47.990> guys<00:04:48.140> understand<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.580> let's<00:04:49.789> just

we<00:04:53.879> have<00:04:54.119> these<00:04:54.990> three<00:04:55.559> at<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:56.219> want<00:04:56.400> to<00:04:56.550> switch

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
we have these three at we want to switch

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.540 
we have these three at we want to switch
these<00:04:57.300> three<00:04:57.599> at<00:04:57.689> the<00:04:57.779> bottom<00:04:57.900> here<00:04:58.319> now<00:04:59.309> no

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
these three at the bottom here now no

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.570 
these three at the bottom here now no
these<00:04:59.789> three<00:05:00.259> what<00:05:01.259> I<00:05:01.319> can<00:05:01.529> do<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.979> instead<00:05:02.520> of

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
these three what I can do is instead of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.359 
these three what I can do is instead of
hitting<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.419> first<00:05:03.629> button<00:05:04.129> because<00:05:05.129> right

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:05.369 
hitting the first button because right

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:06.889 
hitting the first button because right
to<00:05:05.550> get<00:05:05.669> those<00:05:05.879> three<00:05:06.149> I'd<00:05:06.240> have<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.629> get<00:05:06.749> these

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:06.899 
to get those three I'd have to get these

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.170 
to get those three I'd have to get these
two<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:07.559> one<00:05:07.770> instead<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.849> hitting<00:05:09.059> just

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
two and this one instead of hitting just

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.609 
two and this one instead of hitting just
that<00:05:09.360> button<00:05:09.629> and<00:05:09.779> then<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.139> second<00:05:10.469> button

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:10.619 
that button and then the second button

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.700 
that button and then the second button
what<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.699> can<00:05:11.849> do<00:05:11.969> is<00:05:12.089> hit<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.389> first<00:05:12.629> and<00:05:12.990> the

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
found that no matter what combination of

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.209 
found that no matter what combination of
the<00:05:20.879> buttons<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.270> hit<00:05:21.569> it's<00:05:22.469> never<00:05:22.919> going<00:05:23.159> to

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
the buttons you hit it's never going to

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:28.309 
the buttons you hit it's never going to
take<00:05:23.460> any<00:05:23.729> more<00:05:23.999> than<00:05:24.080> 34<00:05:25.080> moves<00:05:25.399> to<00:05:26.399> bring<00:05:27.319> to

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
take any more than 34 moves to bring to

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.489 
take any more than 34 moves to bring to
kind<00:05:28.529> of<00:05:28.710> get<00:05:29.580> all<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.180> Pink's<00:05:30.870> down<00:05:31.050> back<00:05:31.289> to

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:31.499 
kind of get all the Pink's down back to

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:35.360 
kind of get all the Pink's down back to
the<00:05:31.589> bottom<00:05:33.110> there<00:05:34.110> may<00:05:34.229> be<00:05:34.259> a<00:05:34.409> more<00:05:34.649> than<00:05:34.800> 34

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
the bottom there may be a more than 34

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.730 
the bottom there may be a more than 34
move<00:05:35.779> combination<00:05:36.779> of<00:05:36.899> those<00:05:37.050> buttons<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:37.469> just

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
move combination of those buttons I just

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.209 
move combination of those buttons I just
haven't<00:05:37.919> found<00:05:38.069> but<00:05:38.339> 34<00:05:38.729> is<00:05:38.879> the<00:05:39.419> max<00:05:39.629> I<00:05:39.809> found

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
haven't found but 34 is the max I found

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.989 
haven't found but 34 is the max I found
so<00:05:42.059> that<00:05:42.210> means<00:05:42.389> 56<00:05:43.229> for<00:05:43.620> Part<00:05:43.830> 1<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.219> 34<00:05:44.819> for

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:44.999 
so that means 56 for Part 1 and 34 for

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.499 
so that means 56 for Part 1 and 34 for
part<00:05:45.360> 2<00:05:45.479> is<00:05:45.599> the<00:05:45.719> max<00:05:45.899> so<00:05:47.149> yeah<00:05:48.149> there<00:05:48.360> you<00:05:48.479> go

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
part 2 is the max so yeah there you go

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.170 
part 2 is the max so yeah there you go
if<00:05:48.779> I'm<00:05:48.959> half<00:05:49.559> decent<00:05:49.800> at<00:05:50.099> math<00:05:50.309> that<00:05:50.610> adds<00:05:50.909> up

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
if I'm half decent at math that adds up

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.799 
if I'm half decent at math that adds up
to<00:05:51.240> 90<00:05:51.689> so<00:05:51.930> it's<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:52.979> and<00:05:53.509> there<00:05:54.509> you<00:05:54.539> go<00:05:54.749> and

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:54.809 
to 90 so it's that and there you go and

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.320 
to 90 so it's that and there you go and
you<00:05:54.930> can<00:05:55.050> see<00:05:55.229> we've<00:05:55.409> switched<00:05:55.649> these<00:05:55.949> three

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
you can see we've switched these three

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.619 
you can see we've switched these three
so<00:05:57.330> there<00:05:57.479> you<00:05:57.599> go<00:05:57.719> that's<00:05:58.589> how<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:58.889> solve<00:05:59.189> a

00:05:59.619 --> 00:05:59.629 
so there you go that's how you solve a

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.689 
so there you go that's how you solve a
lights-out<00:06:00.629> puzzle<00:06:01.189> yeah<00:06:02.189> hope<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.550> guys

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
lights-out puzzle yeah hope you guys
