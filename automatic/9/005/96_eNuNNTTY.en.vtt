00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.449
 neighbor him a certain four the president because of what we realize here as a club 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.929
 with that one and his 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.669
 this country has been where i have been 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.029
 but that one time the asphalt is that terrain of the other 10 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.880
 stalt arose dutch club to act 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.119
 a very satisfied one 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.989
 10 a choice where I have been from a handy booklet 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.779
 just a few the pioneers 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.180
 which should not be underestimated as a new project 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.950
 that there are a lot of steps that we had to learn 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090
 where we must first strangely surrounds 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 but first let's get the responses we are now and i 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.360
 thanks i'm gay that we are very satisfied 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 and that responses from the people who left work are extremely careful 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 to be 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 the roadside in the site pools one for the current offer is an art 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 perhaps not the most in favor of the trial 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.800
 the beauty of a job around what a beast of the loose wrist falls one 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.950
 office 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.970
 who is the man who talks the room then brought himself 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.940
 for dismissal first artists is to know man mainly on the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 Youth selection has the basket but not everyone now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.150
 they are all bolder first we have selected 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.520
 there was a door the choice for quality 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.540
 palin them art 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.480
 order a coincidence that now turned out to be anneke flemish points are also the one 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.740
 strong 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.180
 mark not specific the choice for that is a come one by the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.310
 through the objective loss of quality 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 as a club Brugge already had an annual activity 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.360
 the hour or four stars were fairly well-known a second time 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.729
 two years ago I switched to a different concept and have it in the latino 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
 fierstente salt statines 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.150
 also more or less arose 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.490
 a cultural head stand the something to go andy rubin 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.230
 and we have that in a vital 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.390
 in bringing art 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 because roads have municipalities 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.350
 about a very nice site and the pulpit 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.549
 and that there are also a number of renowned artists cm 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.579
 that make the effort to exhibit the four times 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.289
 two years in as the lamps grow and two top fit again 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.289
 to arrive at a reading of 42 artists 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.059
 where dnb earlier 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.419
 to gold that on the one hand bart bw 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.269
 a relatively unknown person until the people in the church are already very familiar 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.889
 and the rating quoted on candy d is the first to have it 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:35.699
 painting 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:36.839
 canvas 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.069
 full to 18 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.229
 no and the glass art he calls then shares smoking and this a weekend ever 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.759
 choose a boat and start 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.789
 it can continue for years and 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.889
 that we are biennial and biennial 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.889
 always be able to organize a manifestation 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.180
 don't let the heathen scenes like the line the main one is wrong there 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.709
 nothing has banned 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.259
 does it mean that by name the community wants something a return from 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.159
 I know people who are struggling to try the less fortunate 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.539
 to the extent possible 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.589
 and now the index and that should be worth it and stink 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.649
 it now seemed like the two-year crisis period 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.219
 to set up the food banks 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.379
 incidents evening m 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.560
 people are amazed by the success that becomes of course human 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.099
 so that is the first you need the center and need to focus on control 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.179
 to do 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:33.329
 and that there are many moving I confess 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.239
 conceive that exhibition as a saleswoman 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.579
 for all workers, it becomes the number of boats and shares 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.959
 of the proceeds from which we vote 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.519
 as it were very well known to the larense by the artist 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.809
 the views 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.399
 this is the way of working 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.919
 The site has been open to the public week now and has almost every night nocturnes 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.129
 in egypt by four mast those staff self-employed people who have one or more such 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.310
 or promotion first has to make this site for a wide audience while I still 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.079
 opened 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.179
 Breda the evening from 5 to 11 p.m. 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.999
 Saturday 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.139
 17 hours 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.619
 and such a day 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:15.870
 from eleven o'clock 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.549
 5 pm
