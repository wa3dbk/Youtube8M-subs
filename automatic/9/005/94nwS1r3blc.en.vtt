00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:29.089 
and the best way to do that is really to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.729 
and the best way to do that is really to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
first I think we say that in the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.780 
first I think we say that in the
description<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:30.800> sometimes<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.310> think<00:02:31.370> people

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
description but sometimes I think people

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.700 
description but sometimes I think people
miss<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.300> sometimes<00:02:32.480> they<00:02:32.780> put<00:02:32.990> where

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
miss it and sometimes they put where

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.260 
miss it and sometimes they put where
they<00:02:33.830> might<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.070> spent<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.490> most<00:02:34.610> time<00:02:34.760> but

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
they might have spent the most time but

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.090 
they might have spent the most time but
maybe<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.630> what<00:02:36.050> was<00:02:36.170> most<00:02:36.350> important<00:02:36.950> to

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
maybe not what was most important to

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.850 
maybe not what was most important to
them<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.540> about<00:02:39.020> where<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.470> what<00:02:39.740> you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
them think to about where you what you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.350
