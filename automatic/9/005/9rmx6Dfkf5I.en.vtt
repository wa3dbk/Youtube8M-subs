00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.019
 another and also see another there you can see 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.680

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.420
 lessons and face- to- face viewers in the video 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.100
 Today's real quick I wanna show 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.090
 You are something I do as an omega. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.279
 absolute there talimping cute but 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.410
 which happens in almost all men 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 see if I can get footage that is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.210
 seeing here the man is very low in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.950
 front 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.510
 it is as low as it is lowered 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.260
 original but it is when parked public 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 it usually happens trek รณ in the cord 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 the right sidewalk 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:59.309
 So we settled quickly to black. 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:02.219
 and any magazine is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.860
 get the camera break the vega party 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:11.400
 care was off by 1 to 1 and will do 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:28.650
 k1 quickly shaken one thing 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:35.900
 because it has closed down something already 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 will be k already going to be here and you will see 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.860
 now seems to have been to co-opt the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.799
 plata painted for different city 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.369
 when it's dry, be homogeneous 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.180
 and you're hardly going to say that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 You fix that scratch there in the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.280
 same color and thing and such 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.509
 goes very well unnoticed and it is 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.649
 what is ahead of man is always 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.909
 impeccable 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.460
 I always keep the team there, do nothing 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 both in front of the omega and in the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.080
 front of the sides 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.520
 I want to see if I do the same here already 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520
 worn little 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 I'm going to roll here and have to throw the whole door 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.110
 to do the frizzo right 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 here at home I did it there is neither 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.549
 looks 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.549
 Look, only appear in the new position. 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.519
 understood to be careful not to paint 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.519
 that's why it gets zeroed 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.239

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.970

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.519
 Business okay. 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.879
 super tip for you to keep ahead the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.430
 theologian always at least intact than 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.530
 to win will win even have no way 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.459
 win because the man in front is very 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.310
 long any audience you go 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.379
 park or a lanyard from a 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.920
 A little higher if you do not care 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:17.959
 it will drag and beauty was worth the hint 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.959
