patties<00:00:03.000> for<00:00:03.210> our<00:00:03.330> beehive

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
patties for our beehive

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.960 
patties for our beehive
they're<00:00:04.620> called<00:00:04.890> grease<00:00:05.190> patties<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.850> they

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
they're called grease patties and they

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.730 
they're called grease patties and they
were<00:00:06.089> developed<00:00:06.540> by<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.690> University<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.529> West

Virginia<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.550> think<00:00:09.090> starting<00:00:09.840> back<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.219> 1996

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
Virginia I think starting back in 1996

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.560 
Virginia I think starting back in 1996
what<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> mixture<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.290> sugar

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
what it is is a mixture of sugar

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.330 
what it is is a mixture of sugar
shortening<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:17.539> wintergreen<00:00:18.539> oil<00:00:19.340> this

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
shortening and wintergreen oil this

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.790 
shortening and wintergreen oil this
wintergreen<00:00:20.970> oil<00:00:21.289> when<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.439> comes<00:00:22.650> in

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
wintergreen oil when that comes in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
wintergreen oil when that comes in
contacts<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.150> mites<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
contacts with the mites that are on the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
contacts with the mites that are on the
bees<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:26.340> die<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:29.070> bees<00:00:29.279> will<00:00:29.490> also

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
bees they die and so the bees will also

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970 
bees they die and so the bees will also
be<00:00:30.000> able<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.630> sugar<00:00:30.900> makes<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> bees

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
be able the sugar makes it so the bees

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.030 
be able the sugar makes it so the bees
take<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.489> into<00:00:32.790> their<00:00:32.910> systems<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.800> then<00:00:34.800> as

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
take it into their systems and then as

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
take it into their systems and then as
they<00:00:35.219> eat<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> brush<00:00:36.329> themselves<00:00:36.899> off

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
they eat that and brush themselves off

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.799 
they eat that and brush themselves off
the<00:00:37.440> mites<00:00:38.250> die<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:38.910> there's<00:00:39.450> some

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the mites die because there's some

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.160 
the mites die because there's some
chemical<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.600> winter<00:00:42.600> green<00:00:43.230> oil<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> here

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
chemical in the winter green oil so here

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.619 
chemical in the winter green oil so here
we<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.789> recipe<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.450> we

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we go we got for this recipe because we

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.380 
we go we got for this recipe because we
only<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:48.960> high<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.760> cups<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.210> sugar

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
only have one high got two cups of sugar

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.750 
only have one high got two cups of sugar
one<00:00:52.170> cup<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.559> shortening<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.309> half<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one cup of shortening and about half of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.779 
one cup of shortening and about half of
that<00:00:53.910> bottle<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> wintergreen<00:00:54.660> oil<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.260> say

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
that bottle of wintergreen oil they say

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.279 
that bottle of wintergreen oil they say
11<00:00:56.789> cc's<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.719> bottles<00:00:58.079> 30<00:00:58.949> CC's<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
11 cc's and that bottles 30 CC's so you

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
11 cc's and that bottles 30 CC's so you
just<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:01.920> half<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.579> 15<00:01:03.030> more

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
just take about half of it it's 15 more

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.579 
just take about half of it it's 15 more
or<00:01:03.390> less<00:01:03.539> than<00:01:03.780> that'll<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.199> good

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
or less than that'll be good

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.590 
or less than that'll be good
know<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:06.920> got<00:01:07.920> sugar<00:01:08.450> right<00:01:09.450> in

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
know so here we go got sugar right in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.800 
know so here we go got sugar right in
this<00:01:09.689> bowl<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:11.930> just<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.570> got

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this bowl here just like that you got

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.690 
this bowl here just like that you got
your<00:01:15.990> wintergreen<00:01:16.530> oil<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.310> say<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
your wintergreen oil and they say this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080 
your wintergreen oil and they say this
stuff<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.180> pretty<00:01:18.509> strong<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.090> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
stuff is pretty strong you see so you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
stuff is pretty strong you see so you
know<00:01:21.210> there's<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.720> full<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> guess<00:01:22.740> about

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
know there's about full so I guess about

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.499 
know there's about full so I guess about
to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> middle<00:01:23.759> part<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.450> says

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to the middle part there where it says

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
to the middle part there where it says
wintergreen<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:27.530> will<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
wintergreen and that will put it and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
wintergreen and that will put it and
also<00:01:29.549> once<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.060> gets<00:01:30.329> mixed<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.950> will

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
also once this gets mixed up you will

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
also once this gets mixed up you will
want<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.610> rubber<00:01:32.790> gloves<00:01:33.210> because

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
want to put on rubber gloves because

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.620 
want to put on rubber gloves because
they<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.960> strong<00:01:34.970> direct<00:01:35.970> contact<00:01:36.450> for

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
they say this strong direct contact for

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
they say this strong direct contact for
this<00:01:36.750> particular<00:01:37.320> wintergreen<00:01:38.009> oil<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
this particular wintergreen oil is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.360 
this particular wintergreen oil is
irritant<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.329> skin<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.009> go

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.770 

how<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.540> doing<00:01:47.330> yeah

seems about about right we're just gonna
hack<00:01:55.950> together<00:01:57.500> one<00:01:58.500> cup<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> shortening

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.020

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
one cup of short now I'll just try and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.080 
one cup of short now I'll just try and
bang<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.740> in<00:02:12.860> here<00:02:13.130> probably<00:02:13.460> with<00:02:13.910> most

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
bang it in here probably with most
