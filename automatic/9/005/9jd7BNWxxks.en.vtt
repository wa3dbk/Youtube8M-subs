got it back today from Canon for repairs

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.879 
got it back today from Canon for repairs
what<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.120> doing<00:00:09.300> before<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.559> back

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
what it was doing before was back

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.560 
what it was doing before was back
focusing<00:00:11.809> only<00:00:12.809> between<00:00:13.639> 24<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.109> about<00:00:16.109> 30

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
focusing only between 24 and about 30

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
focusing only between 24 and about 30
millimetres<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:19.070> what<00:00:20.070> would<00:00:20.220> happen<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
millimetres and what would happen is you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.670 
millimetres and what would happen is you
would<00:00:21.060> focus<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.779> something<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.410> test

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
would focus on something I have a test

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.029 
would focus on something I have a test
target<00:00:23.100> set<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.369> there<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:24.539> focal<00:00:24.960> test<00:00:25.619> target

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
target set up there my focal test target

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.279 
target set up there my focal test target
I've<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.060> brightly<00:00:27.449> lit<00:00:27.779> I've<00:00:28.109> got

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
I've got it very brightly lit I've got

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
I've got it very brightly lit I've got
halogen<00:00:28.740> lights<00:00:28.949> off<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> side<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.880> soft

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
halogen lights off to the side to soft

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.560 
halogen lights off to the side to soft
boxes<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> direct<00:00:31.969> modeling<00:00:32.969> light<00:00:33.149> here

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
boxes and a direct modeling light here

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
boxes and a direct modeling light here
so<00:00:33.719> I've<00:00:34.380> got<00:00:34.500> plenty<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> light<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.399> it's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so I've got plenty of light on it it's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.410 
so I've got plenty of light on it it's
setting<00:00:36.480> up<00:00:36.570> vertical<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:41.300> what<00:00:42.300> would

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
setting up vertical and what would

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.580 
setting up vertical and what would
happen<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> focus<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:45.079> before<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.289> sent

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
happen is you focus on it before I sent

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.940 
happen is you focus on it before I sent
it<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.539> between<00:00:48.539> 24<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.110> 30<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:49.770> always

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it in between 24 and 30 it would always

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.490 
it in between 24 and 30 it would always
be<00:00:50.190> back<00:00:50.370> focused<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.899> would<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.230> sharp

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
be back focused so this would be sharp

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.229 
be back focused so this would be sharp
and<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.550> come<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and they would all come in like that so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.110 
and they would all come in like that so
everything<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> focus<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> got<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
everything was out of focus so I got it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.760 
everything was out of focus so I got it
back<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.219> it's<00:00:59.219> even<00:00:59.520> worse<00:01:00.379> it's<00:01:01.379> still

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
back and it's even worse it's still

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.740 
back and it's even worse it's still
doing<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.430> 24<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.570> about<00:01:03.960> 26<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:06.600> it's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
doing it at 24 to about 26 but it's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.020 
doing it at 24 to about 26 but it's
inconsistent<00:01:07.369> through<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> range<00:01:08.670> there's<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
inconsistent through the range there's a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.890 
inconsistent through the range there's a
couple<00:01:09.240> spots<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.979> between<00:01:11.700> where<00:01:12.479> it's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
couple spots now in between where it's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530 
couple spots now in between where it's
just<00:01:13.049> off<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.250> front<00:01:14.580> focusing<00:01:15.180> at

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
just off it's actually front focusing at

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450 
just off it's actually front focusing at
a<00:01:15.630> couple<00:01:15.960> spots<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.320> between<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:17.220> I've<00:01:17.310> got

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
a couple spots in between what I've got

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
a couple spots in between what I've got
here<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> camera<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> tripod<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
here is the camera on a tripod and a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.490 
here is the camera on a tripod and a
remote<00:01:20.009> shutter<00:01:20.580> release

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
remote shutter release

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
remote shutter release
now<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.610> continued<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> live<00:01:24.390> view<00:01:24.630> which

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
now the continued the live view which

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
now the continued the live view which
uses<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> contrast<00:01:25.950> detection<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.970> works

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
uses a contrast detection that works

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.070 
uses a contrast detection that works
flawlessly

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
flawlessly

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140 
flawlessly
of<00:01:28.259> course<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.860> using<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.490> sensor<00:01:29.820> data<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of course it's using the sensor data to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
of course it's using the sensor data to
focus<00:01:30.659> live<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.390> easily<00:01:33.600> test<00:01:34.590> your

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
focus live and you can easily test your

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
focus live and you can easily test your
autofocus<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> lens<00:01:36.200> by<00:01:37.200> comparing<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
autofocus in the lens by comparing the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
autofocus in the lens by comparing the
results<00:01:39.540> between<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> two<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
results between the two and the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.160 
results between the two and the
autofocus<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.540> off<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.509> example<00:01:45.899> here

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
autofocus is off so for example here

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
autofocus is off so for example here
I've<00:01:46.350> got<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> target<00:01:46.860> set<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:50.700> I'm

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
I've got the target set up and now I'm

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.859 
I've got the target set up and now I'm
going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.759> put<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.970> 24<00:01:54.509> millimetres<00:01:56.869> I'm

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
going to put it on 24 millimetres I'm

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.830 
going to put it on 24 millimetres I'm
going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> manually<00:01:58.500> D<00:01:58.860> focus<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
going to manually D focus I'm going to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.540 
going to manually D focus I'm going to
use<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.259> remote<00:02:01.799> shutter<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:05.130> focus

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.610 

okay<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.789> see<00:02:09.940> where<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.440> focus<00:02:11.440> line

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
okay you can see where it is focus line

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.920 
okay you can see where it is focus line
is<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.099> right<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.910> 10-foot<00:02:13.450> mark<00:02:13.660> and

is to the right of the 10-foot mark and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.740 
is to the right of the 10-foot mark and
it's<00:02:14.890> focused<00:02:15.250> right<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.790> middle<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.599> that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it's focused right on the middle of that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
in D focus again and use another focus

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.890 
in D focus again and use another focus
here<00:02:32.099> now<00:02:33.099> it's<00:02:33.400> right<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.420> zero<00:02:34.629> of<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
here now it's right on the zero of the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.440 
here now it's right on the zero of the
ten<00:02:35.170> mark<00:02:35.379> now<00:02:35.620> if<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.830> go<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:35.980> 70<00:02:36.459> D<00:02:36.700> focus<00:02:37.060> again

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.080 

right<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.750> ten<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.379> it's<00:02:42.010> off<00:02:42.250> at<00:02:42.760> 24<00:02:43.360> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
right on the ten so it's off at 24 and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.530 
right on the ten so it's off at 24 and
will<00:02:46.090> confirm<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.540> again<00:02:51.269> now<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
will confirm that again now it's a

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.030 
will confirm that again now it's a
little<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> right<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:53.680> different

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
little to the right so it's different

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.430 
little to the right so it's different
than<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.370> was<00:02:54.519> before<00:02:55.319> try<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.379> again

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
than it was before try it again

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.470

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
so there it's way off so it's off and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.500 
so there it's way off so it's off and
it's<00:03:01.690> inconsistent<00:03:01.989> great<00:03:02.769> combo<00:03:03.160> right

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
it's inconsistent great combo right

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.020 
it's inconsistent great combo right
