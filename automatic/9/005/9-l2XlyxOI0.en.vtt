00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.830
 Today I finally bring it to you and I hope that you 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830
 like it a lot and let's start 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.660
 youtube because right now my favorite 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 Youtube favorite is Juan Pablo Jaramillo 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.030
 but good at this time it's just 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.660
 change a lot of favorite youtuber before 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.360
 was 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.880
 you took to villalobos and now it's juan 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.280
 pablo jaramillo trova not only change a 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.320
 heap if you had a book of your life 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.050
 joy is the end to see then 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.450
 if I can improve the end if they tell me 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.690
 which is the end and you can improve it or 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.460
 change something yes but if my end you're going 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 I can change the sign or anything 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 I would not read it because maybe it's a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.750
 final super bad and it would depress me all my 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 life so if I can improve if 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 we press gallery which is what more and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.000
 what you like the least about youtube what 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.190
 I like youtube is ye 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 that you are seeing me because I do not know 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.250
 tell a lot of the day without knowing each other 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.890
 so in personal YouTube, it's because I'm not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
 I am super affectionate and such, so what 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.850
 I like more from youtube 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 I think it's you and the least 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.580
 I like youtube the hackers in the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.100
 new non-constructive comments if 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.619
 it is a comment a low plan the music 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 you do not listen to it, I like it 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.130
 because that is to say, it is advice for 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.530
 better but if it's a comment in plan 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 you're stupid I do not know what that is also 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.320
 so what I like most about you and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.259
 what less the haters or jaques or as 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.720

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.390
 same I do not have any my last animal 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.450
 it was a guinea pig that is a rabbit of 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.720
 Indian and he died and the truth that he gave me 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.340
 I spent a lot of grief so badly 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.470
 yes I like animals but 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.270
 when they die the love that has them 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.280
 it's because you go wrong country where you 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.310
 I would like to travel as you already know 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.110
 What kind of gender would I choose? 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.340
 adventure genre more than anything because 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.159

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.400
 I would choose the adventure but also 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.770
 adventure with a tad of love in plan 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.469
 for example an adventure book and that 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.120
 there is also a couple that is love and 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.120
 that they have to do many 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.099
 discover many things something something like that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.430
 together so adventure and love in one 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:15.060
 what is my dream, my dream would be 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:19.830

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.990
