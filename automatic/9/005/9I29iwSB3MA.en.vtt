00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.680
 at sea the force of the weather does not 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.930
 discounts for anyone 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.330
 the great oceanic skippers know it well 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.490
 which for decades has put a strain on itself 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.089
 same and all the sophisticated systems 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 of their futuristic boats 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 sailing speed is reaching 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.119
 new goals like the technology of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 reduced weight marine propellers ed 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.170
 reliability in management both in 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.090
 long races in its function of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.619
 electric generator that in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.420
 vessel transfers manage 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.579
 a marine engine like the great champions 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.450
 of the ocean means above all 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450
 always prepared 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.160
 always get the main pieces of 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.190
 spare parts corresponding to the model of 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.740
 your engine checked periodically 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.100
 its operation especially in 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.930
 long navigation always on board 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.790
 all the necessary tools for 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.360
 carry out the main operations of 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.040
 ordinary maintenance experience 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.290
 and be familiar with these 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.660
 Simple operations is important first 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.820
 to take off could happen to you 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.640
 a simple inconvenience even at the top 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.440
 sea ​​and in unfavorable weather conditions 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:30.220
 when it depends more than ever on the network 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:32.229
 your engine always refuel with 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.360
 abundant supply of lubricants and 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.220
 official refrigerants and used there 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.160
 as recommended by the house 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.570
 builder of your marine engine 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.280
 following the variations by season and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.770
 temperature always checked 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.360
 all the levels were scrupulously 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.250
 advocates where it is necessary to win a 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.090
 around the world alone depends on 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.210
 many factors 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.160
 Giovanni Soldini knows that well in 1998 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.160
 it is stated in the round to them 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.950
 Now we had a problem because I 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.079
 he had developed the belt 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.920
 fears of alternators so I owe you 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.920
 change a belt 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.590
 even for pennies as for stada ports 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.480
 along the coast 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.800
 the experience makes the actress 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.520
 here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.320
 rota an even smaller problem in advance 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.400
 equals more damage than 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.030
 foil 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.030
 here is the food 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.660
 looking for spare acilia 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.280
 camilo 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.020
 total 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.550
 not being able to charge the batteries in one 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.920
 probably an ocean race today 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.930
 it means losing it because these 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.960
 accumulators power all the systems 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.390
 electric and electronic on board 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.280
 computer satellite phones 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.710
 weather information everything goes out e 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.860
 so also the skill of the skipper must 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.850
 yield to technological superiority 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.520
 opponent 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.530
 preparation therefore makes the difference 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.480
 today like the great navigators the French 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.640
 even our young man has gone 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.340
 towards the new and fast frontiers 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.830
 of ocean sailing bringing with it the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.230
 same philosophy is a respect for the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.120
 strength and beauty of the sea suitable 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.120
 therefore to all the navigators
