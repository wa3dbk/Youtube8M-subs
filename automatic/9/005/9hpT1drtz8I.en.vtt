00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 there are many all of plants against 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.400
 zombies and good is my first gameplay 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.049
 playing on the plants against zombies 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 here in the xv uruguay you know that I 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.469
 bought very few days ago 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.960
 you will have the unboxing through the channel of the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 last ones that I will have uploaded and we will see 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.599
 how does the game go down to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 multiplayer before I got a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 heading to climb the first but I've 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.560
 killed one and the game was already 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.660
 about to finish so let's see if 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 we can play and that lasts longer because 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.730
 apparently they put you in started matches 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.290
 if you did not have bad luck or something and more 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.470
 stuck not started 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.760
 and now I think they're going to kill me if good 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.740
 Well, if you see that I'm a bit maimed 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.270
 I also want to tell you that the first 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.010
 times I play with a command of the xbox 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.960
 one I'm not used to playing with 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.880
 these controls so I still do not know 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.860
 very well where is the X and with this 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.470
 nobody gave me a little with play 3 color 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.820
 but you will try to do everything in 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.130
 what you can 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.010
 well then after a good time already 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.390

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.400
 departure is that I honestly do not know if
