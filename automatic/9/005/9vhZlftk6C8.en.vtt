00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.789 
in fact there were so many in stock that
I<00:01:37.389> think<00:01:37.749> the<00:01:37.840> last<00:01:38.020> time<00:01:38.109> I<00:01:38.229> was<00:01:38.380> there<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
I think the last time I was there the

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.010 
I think the last time I was there the
price<00:01:39.009> went<00:01:39.249> down<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.549> 30<00:01:39.819> bucks<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.719> you<00:01:40.779> might

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
price went down to 30 bucks so you might

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.899 
price went down to 30 bucks so you might
want<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.229> go<00:01:41.319> check<00:01:41.380> those<00:01:41.679> out<00:01:41.859> orange<00:01:42.759> I'm

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
want to go check those out orange I'm

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
want to go check those out orange I'm
not<00:01:43.060> really<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.329> big<00:01:43.419> fan<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.689> but<00:01:44.079> functional

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
not really a big fan of but functional

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.550 
not really a big fan of but functional
functionality<00:01:45.880> wise<00:01:45.999> it's<00:01:46.659> actually<00:01:46.989> makes

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
functionality wise it's actually makes

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.050 
functionality wise it's actually makes
sense<00:01:47.649> because<00:01:47.950> when<00:01:48.520> you're<00:01:48.639> hiking<00:01:48.759> that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
sense because when you're hiking that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.789 
sense because when you're hiking that
bright<00:01:49.419> orange<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.899> going<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.079> stick<00:01:50.289> out<00:01:50.439> so

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
bright orange is going to stick out so

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.459 
bright orange is going to stick out so
if<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:51.849> don't<00:01:51.999> mind<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.209> orange<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:53.049> content

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
if you don't mind the orange and content

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.739 
if you don't mind the orange and content
you<00:01:54.459> want<00:01:54.579> a<00:01:54.759> really<00:01:54.999> good<00:01:55.149> deal<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.599> might

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
you want a really good deal you might

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:56.760 
you want a really good deal you might
want<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:55.989> check<00:01:56.109> those<00:01:56.259> out<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.560> might<00:01:56.649> be

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
want to check those out you might be

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.469 
want to check those out you might be

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
mornings when it gets pretty windy and I

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.910 
mornings when it gets pretty windy and I
can<00:02:32.510> test<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.049> fact<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.560> really

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
can test to the fact that this is really

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250 
can test to the fact that this is really
win<00:02:34.189> resistant<00:02:34.780> I'm<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:35.959> amazed

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
win resistant I'm just amazed

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.140 
win resistant I'm just amazed
considering<00:02:36.799> how<00:02:36.889> thin<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.430> how<00:02:37.849> light<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
considering how thin and how light the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.819 
considering how thin and how light the
material<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.719> and<00:02:39.019> its<00:02:39.139> really<00:02:39.319> soft<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
material is and its really soft and

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.860 
material is and its really soft and
comfortable<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.909> that's<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.540> really<00:02:41.569> good

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
comfortable so that's a really good

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.860 
comfortable so that's a really good
thing<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:44.709> polar<00:02:45.709> tech<00:02:46.010> apex<00:02:46.549> 2009<00:02:47.329> award

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
thing the polar tech apex 2009 award

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.990 
thing the polar tech apex 2009 award
winner<00:02:48.019> that's<00:02:48.379> what<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.849> so<00:02:49.849> I<00:02:49.879> guess

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
winner that's what this is so I guess

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.490 
winner that's what this is so I guess
this<00:02:50.299> one's<00:02:50.510> some<00:02:50.689> sort<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.930> award<00:02:51.049> for

going in slightly from the zipper but

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.820 
going in slightly from the zipper but
because<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.790> little<00:05:06.530> rubbery<00:05:07.530> type

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
because of this little rubbery type

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.500 
because of this little rubbery type
lining<00:05:08.220> right<00:05:08.400> behind<00:05:08.730> it<00:05:08.940> it<00:05:09.120> blocks<00:05:09.390> the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
lining right behind it it blocks the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.030 
lining right behind it it blocks the
wind<00:05:09.570> from<00:05:09.810> getting<00:05:10.140> in<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:10.590> kind<00:05:11.010> of

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
wind from getting in and that kind of

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.260 
wind from getting in and that kind of
helps<00:05:11.310> with<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.460> wind<00:05:11.700> resistance<00:05:12.120> right
