00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
EXO Mattrick 1213 we did fraction number

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.080 
EXO Mattrick 1213 we did fraction number
formatting<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.839> our<00:00:16.410> fee<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> Doug<00:00:17.460> Stevens

formatting in our fee and Doug Stevens

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
formatting in our fee and Doug Stevens
gave<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> great<00:00:19.730> different<00:00:20.730> type<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.619> fraction

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
gave a great different type of fraction

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.019 
gave a great different type of fraction
number<00:00:22.890> formatting<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.910> original

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
number formatting now the original

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.580 
number formatting now the original
question<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.199> about<00:00:25.320> these

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
question up here was about these

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.560 
question up here was about these
question<00:00:26.099> marks<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
question marks and what they do and in

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300 
question marks and what they do and in
fact<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.619> custom<00:00:29.130> number

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
fact if you use this custom number

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.380 
fact if you use this custom number
formatting<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.560> number<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.820> 3/25<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
formatting on a number like 3/25 well it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.500 
formatting on a number like 3/25 well it
only<00:00:33.719> shows<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> single<00:00:35.250> digit<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
only shows a single digit and so the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
only shows a single digit and so the
number<00:00:36.899> one<00:00:37.110> eighth<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.559> different<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
number one eighth is different on the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.700 
number one eighth is different on the
surface<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> spreadsheet<00:00:39.809> than<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
surface of the spreadsheet than what is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
surface of the spreadsheet than what is
actually<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.579> cell<00:00:41.850> down<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
actually in the cell down here if you

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
actually in the cell down here if you
use<00:00:43.410> two<00:00:43.770> question<00:00:44.520> marks<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
use two question marks it's going to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.930 
use two question marks it's going to
properly<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.260> two<00:00:46.649> digits<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.399> notice<00:00:47.789> if

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
properly show two digits but notice if

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.680 
properly show two digits but notice if
we<00:00:48.059> use<00:00:48.270> three<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.960> four<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:50.690> indents

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
we use three or four it actually indents

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
we use three or four it actually indents
it<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it now over here are some of the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
it now over here are some of the
characters<00:00:54.570> you're<00:00:54.750> allowed<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.500> in

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
characters you're allowed to use in

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
characters you're allowed to use in
custom<00:00:56.219> number<00:00:56.399> formatting<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> ?<00:00:58.079> acts<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
custom number formatting the ? acts as a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
custom number formatting the ? acts as a
digit<00:00:58.920> placeholder<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> does<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.390> display

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
digit placeholder that does not display

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280 
digit placeholder that does not display
in<00:01:01.789> significant<00:01:02.789> digits<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.390> does<00:01:03.780> hold<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
in significant digits but does hold a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.800 
in significant digits but does hold a
place<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> digits<00:01:05.339> align<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.270> notice<00:01:06.630> here

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
place so the digits align so notice here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
place so the digits align so notice here
we<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.409> four<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.150> in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
we have four of them but the in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410 
we have four of them but the in
significant<00:01:10.350> digits<00:01:10.740> meaning<00:01:11.040> ?<00:01:11.220> ?<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.090> do

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
significant digits meaning ? ? here do

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.469 
significant digits meaning ? ? here do
not<00:01:12.450> show<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.320> zeros<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.880> does<00:01:15.150> hold

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
not show up as zeros but it does hold

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
not show up as zeros but it does hold
those<00:01:15.780> placeholders<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.580> our<00:01:17.820> case

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
those placeholders so the in our case

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.899 
those placeholders so the in our case
with<00:01:18.360> fraction<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> slash<00:01:19.890> shows<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.700> with

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
with fraction the slash shows up with

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
with fraction the slash shows up with
the<00:01:21.090> proper<00:01:21.330> alignment<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the proper alignment now actually if you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
the proper alignment now actually if you
were<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.060> use<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> question<00:01:24.900> marks<00:01:25.110> here

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
were to use the question marks here

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.280 
were to use the question marks here
here's<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.619> example<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.299> 3/25<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.080> use

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
here's an example of 3/25 you could use

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
here's an example of 3/25 you could use
00<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.640> digit<00:01:29.970> play<00:01:30.119> sort<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
00 that's a digit play sort of the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.370 
00 that's a digit play sort of the
display<00:01:30.900> significant<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.210> insignificant

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
display significant and insignificant

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.069 
display significant and insignificant
zeros<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.090> three<00:01:36.780> with

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
zeros right so here we see three with

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.920 
zeros right so here we see three with
two<00:01:37.259> leading<00:01:37.590> zeros<00:01:38.299> 25<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> leading<00:01:39.900> 0

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
two leading zeros 25 with a leading 0

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.260 
two leading zeros 25 with a leading 0
that<00:01:40.200> would<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.500> ridiculous<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.310> fraction

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
that would be ridiculous in fraction

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
that would be ridiculous in fraction
formatting<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:42.899> using<00:01:43.740> zeros<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.310> great<00:01:44.520> for

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
formatting but using zeros is great for

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
formatting but using zeros is great for
leading<00:01:45.299> digits<00:01:45.899> ah<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.189> one

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
leading digits ah but this is the one

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
leading digits ah but this is the one
that<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.700> wafi<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.329> Doug<00:01:48.680> suggested<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.770> use

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that I wafi and Doug suggested we use

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
that I wafi and Doug suggested we use
for<00:01:50.159> fraction<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.880> beautiful<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:51.840> if

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
for fraction it's beautiful because if

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.620 
for fraction it's beautiful because if
we<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.220> three<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.090> it'll<00:01:54.270> display

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
we have three of them here it'll display

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.620 
we have three of them here it'll display
up<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> three<00:01:55.470> digits<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> won't<00:01:56.630> indent

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
up to three digits but it won't indent

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.560 
up to three digits but it won't indent
it<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.409> question<00:01:59.009> marks<00:01:59.340> does<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.360> let's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it as the question marks does so let's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.300 
it as the question marks does so let's
try<00:02:00.780> our<00:02:00.810> same<00:02:01.229> example<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.009> I'm<00:02:02.189> going

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
try our same example over here I'm going

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
try our same example over here I'm going
to<00:02:02.399> highlight<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.939> these<00:02:03.210> cells<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to highlight all these cells and in the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.359 
to highlight all these cells and in the
active<00:02:04.259> cell<00:02:04.469> I'm<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> formula

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
active cell I'm going to make a formula

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.469 
active cell I'm going to make a formula
equals<00:02:05.759> 3<00:02:06.450> /<00:02:06.990> 25<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.670> formula<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
equals 3 / 25 now that formula in the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.420 
equals 3 / 25 now that formula in the
active<00:02:09.840> cell<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.379> populate<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.190> down

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
active cell I can populate it down

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.949 
active cell I can populate it down
through<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> highlighted<00:02:12.540> cells<00:02:12.750> by

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
through all the highlighted cells by

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.620 
through all the highlighted cells by
holding

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
holding

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.500 
holding
roll<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.050> enter<00:02:14.920> now<00:02:15.430> that's<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.030> actual

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
roll and enter now that's the actual

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.540 
roll and enter now that's the actual
decimal<00:02:17.440> right<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.010> don't<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.400> to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
decimal right but we don't want to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.990 
decimal right but we don't want to
display<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:20.040> control<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.730> open

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
display it that way control one to open

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.130 
display it that way control one to open
up<00:02:22.150> format<00:02:22.540> cells<00:02:22.810> go<00:02:23.020> down<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.410> custom<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
up format cells go down to custom and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.130 
up format cells go down to custom and
over<00:02:26.140> here<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.800> type<00:02:27.220> I'm<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.140> pound

sign<00:02:29.970> /<00:02:30.970> pound<00:02:31.690> side<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.350> see<00:02:32.380> very

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
sign / pound side we can see very

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.140 
sign / pound side we can see very
clearly<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:33.160> that's<00:02:33.520> not<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> work

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
clearly that that's not going to work

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.750 
clearly that that's not going to work
when<00:02:34.450> i<00:02:34.480> hit<00:02:34.690> enter<00:02:34.840> because<00:02:35.140> it's<00:02:35.950> showing<00:02:36.520> 1

when i hit enter because it's showing 1
8th<00:02:36.940> now<00:02:37.120> maybe<00:02:37.510> that's<00:02:37.930> what<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.440> want<00:02:38.710> but

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
8th now maybe that's what you want but

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.390 
8th now maybe that's what you want but
we're<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.810> displaying<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.260> actual<00:02:42.040> number

we're not displaying the actual number

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.450 
we're not displaying the actual number
that's<00:02:42.640> underneath<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.800> number<00:02:45.310> on

that's underneath that is a number on

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
different than the number underneath so

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.270

can come down to this next one and this

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.970 
can come down to this next one and this
is<00:03:00.790> what's<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.210> cool<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.990> can<00:03:02.170> control<00:03:02.680> one

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
is what's so cool we can control one

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.610 
is what's so cool we can control one
custom<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.880> here<00:03:04.450> i<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.780> go<00:03:04.900> pound<00:03:05.470> pound

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620

pound / pound pound pound what this will
do<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.460> i<00:03:09.940> were<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.330> type<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.780> third<00:03:11.140> digit<00:03:11.680> it

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
do is if i were to type a third digit it

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.310 
do is if i were to type a third digit it
would<00:03:12.240> accommodate<00:03:13.240> it<00:03:13.450> but<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:13.930> i<00:03:14.020> click<00:03:14.260> ok

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
would accommodate it but if i click ok

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.000 
would accommodate it but if i click ok
it<00:03:14.890> doesn't<00:03:15.550> slide<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.330> over<00:03:16.810> now<00:03:17.320> let's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
it doesn't slide it over now let's

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.950 
it doesn't slide it over now let's
highlight<00:03:18.280> both<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:19.150> these<00:03:19.300> cells<00:03:19.720> here

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
highlight both of these cells here

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.470 
highlight both of these cells here
control<00:03:20.710> one<00:03:21.250> we're<00:03:22.000> going<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> come<00:03:22.300> down

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
control one we're going to come down

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.000 
control one we're going to come down
here<00:03:22.510> now<00:03:22.870> we're<00:03:22.990> going<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.140> do<00:03:23.320> pound<00:03:23.920> pound

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
here now we're going to do pound pound

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.100 
here now we're going to do pound pound
pound<00:03:24.220> 4<00:03:24.610> times<00:03:24.850> 1<00:03:25.120> 2<00:03:25.300> 3<00:03:25.330> 4<00:03:25.600> /<00:03:26.290> 1<00:03:26.770> 2<00:03:27.010> 3<00:03:27.040> 4<00:03:27.870> click<00:03:28.870> OK

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
pound 4 times 1 2 3 4 / 1 2 3 4 click OK

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.040 
pound 4 times 1 2 3 4 / 1 2 3 4 click OK
and<00:03:29.680> now<00:03:30.460> we<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.880> see<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.120> doesn't<00:03:31.390> scoot<00:03:31.900> it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
and now we can see it doesn't scoot it

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.900 
and now we can see it doesn't scoot it
over<00:03:32.140> like<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.680> did<00:03:32.830> with<00:03:32.950> our<00:03:33.130> question<00:03:33.670> marks

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
over like it did with our question marks

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.980 
over like it did with our question marks
but<00:03:34.450> check<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:34.810> up<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.560> could<00:03:36.160> try<00:03:36.280> equals<00:03:36.790> 3<00:03:37.510> /

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
but check this up I could try equals 3 /

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.180 
but check this up I could try equals 3 /
1067<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.260> when<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> control<00:03:42.670> enter<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.709> four

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
1067 and when I control enter the four

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.150 
1067 and when I control enter the four
digit<00:03:45.360> show<00:03:46.360> up<00:03:46.600> but<00:03:47.080> notice<00:03:47.530> whereas<00:03:47.920> with

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
digit show up but notice whereas with

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.300 
digit show up but notice whereas with
the<00:03:48.280> question<00:03:48.730> marks<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.420> slashes<00:03:50.140> are

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
the question marks the slashes are

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.250 
the question marks the slashes are
totally<00:03:51.310> lined<00:03:51.520> up<00:03:51.670> another<00:03:51.959> example<00:03:52.959> for

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
totally lined up another example for

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.840 
totally lined up another example for
this<00:03:53.380> would<00:03:53.590> be<00:03:53.709> if<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:53.920> had<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.100> decimal<00:03:54.730> and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
this would be if you had a decimal and

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.330 
this would be if you had a decimal and
you<00:03:54.940> wanted<00:03:55.240> it<00:03:55.360> lined<00:03:55.570> up<00:03:55.780> right<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.470> here<00:03:56.890> we
