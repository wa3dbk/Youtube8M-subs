the<00:00:01.079> BMC<00:00:01.620> journals<00:00:02.010> now<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> pretty<00:00:02.879> high

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
the BMC journals now have a pretty high

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.150 
the BMC journals now have a pretty high
reputation<00:00:04.040> amongst<00:00:05.040> my<00:00:05.460> colleagues

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160

increasingly<00:00:08.160> being<00:00:08.400> used<00:00:08.460> by<00:00:08.820> them<00:00:09.030> for

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
increasingly being used by them for

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.320 
increasingly being used by them for
publishing<00:00:09.679> so<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.950> natural<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.820> think

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
publishing so it's natural to think

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.189 
publishing so it's natural to think
about<00:00:12.900> using<00:00:13.440> them<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:13.950> publication

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
about using them for publication

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.090 
about using them for publication
publishing<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> journal<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.940> quite<00:00:17.940> painless

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
publishing the journal is quite painless

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.910 
publishing the journal is quite painless
submission<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.189> easy<00:00:20.520> its<00:00:21.210> quick<00:00:21.920> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
submission is easy its quick the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.890 
submission is easy its quick the
referees<00:00:23.310> comments<00:00:23.730> came<00:00:23.910> pretty<00:00:24.510> promptly

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
referees comments came pretty promptly

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.099 
referees comments came pretty promptly
and<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:27.119> decision<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.689> very<00:00:27.869> pretty

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and this is the decision was very pretty

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.690 
and this is the decision was very pretty
from<00:00:28.529> network<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:31.289> real<00:00:31.890> plus<00:00:32.279> points

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
from network and so one real plus points

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.910 
from network and so one real plus points
is<00:00:32.850> speed<00:00:33.270> publication<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.530> want<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
is speed publication you want to get a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.380 
is speed publication you want to get a
article<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:35.969> quickly<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> all<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.200> then

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
article out quickly which we all do then

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
article out quickly which we all do then
online<00:00:39.390> journals<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.500> quicker<00:00:41.460> than

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
online journals are much quicker than

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.450 
online journals are much quicker than
standard<00:00:42.329> journals<00:00:42.719> I've<00:00:43.440> published<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.980> BMC

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
standard journals I've published in BMC

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
standard journals I've published in BMC
evolutionary<00:00:45.230> biology<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.350> BMC

bioinformatics<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:48.320> generally<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
bioinformatics and generally it's it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
bioinformatics and generally it's it
appears<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.370> people<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.000> picked<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.420> on

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
appears that people have picked up on

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.080 
appears that people have picked up on
those<00:00:52.199> complications<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.230> means<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
those complications and so it means that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
those complications and so it means that
access<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.140> people<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.620> looking

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
access is there are people all looking

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.340

at these journals regular life I think

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
at these journals regular life I think
two<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.530> three<00:01:04.710> years<00:01:04.949> ago<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.670> was<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
two or three years ago that was not the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
two or three years ago that was not the
case<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> general<00:01:07.560> opinion<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.369> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
case and the general opinion was that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.520 
case and the general opinion was that
the<00:01:09.659> quality<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.040> publications<00:01:11.640> was<00:01:12.060> low

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the quality of the publications was low

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.520 
the quality of the publications was low
but<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.250> changed<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> last

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
but that really has changed in the last

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.670 
but that really has changed in the last
year<00:01:16.610> we're<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> lot<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.170> colleagues

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
year we're now a lot of my colleagues

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
year we're now a lot of my colleagues
who<00:01:19.920> were<00:01:20.070> resistant<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.659> using<00:01:22.049> these

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
who were resistant to using these

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
who were resistant to using these
journals<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.830> now<00:01:23.670> telling<00:01:23.970> me<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.390> how<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.900> i

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
journals are now telling me all how do i

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.910 
journals are now telling me all how do i
get<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.950> publication<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.000> i<00:01:27.409> think<00:01:28.409> open

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
get my publication in there i think open

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.730 
get my publication in there i think open
access<00:01:29.040> brings<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.939> number<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> advantages

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
access brings a number of advantages

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.090 
access brings a number of advantages
over<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> traditional<00:01:32.490> route<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
over the traditional route one is that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
over the traditional route one is that
it's<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.880> very<00:01:36.090> quick<00:01:36.450> means<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it's right it's a very quick means of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's right it's a very quick means of
getting<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.670> publications<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.960> but

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
getting your publications out but

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.880 
getting your publications out but
because<00:01:40.850> online<00:01:41.850> open<00:01:42.299> access<00:01:42.470> means<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.710> lack

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because online open access means a lack

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.569 
because online open access means a lack
of<00:01:43.950> print<00:01:44.880> rom<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> standard<00:01:46.649> form<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
of print rom of a standard form so it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.760 
of print rom of a standard form so it
has<00:01:48.119> much<00:01:48.329> quicker<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.560> matters

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
has much quicker and that matters

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.249 
has much quicker and that matters
because<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.850> colleagues<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> get

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because you want your colleagues and get

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.690 
because you want your colleagues and get
hold<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.680> research<00:01:53.119> now<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.750> later<00:01:55.700> when

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
hold of your research now not later when

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.719 
hold of your research now not later when
someone<00:01:57.509> else<00:01:57.630> may<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.990> already<00:01:58.549> made<00:01:59.549> in

someone else may have already made in

someone else may have already made in

paper impact in these areas so in the
that<00:02:02.930> you're<00:02:03.049> interested<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:03.880> speed<00:02:04.880> of

so<00:02:24.980> that's<00:02:25.430> not<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.670> problem<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.840> also<00:02:26.989> means

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
so that's not a problem it also means

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.979 
so that's not a problem it also means
that<00:02:27.380> impact<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.269> less-developed<00:02:29.269> parts<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
that impact in less-developed parts of

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.729 
that impact in less-developed parts of
the<00:02:30.050> world<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.760> there<00:02:32.450> without<00:02:32.810> even<00:02:33.470> trying

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the world is there without even trying

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.850 
the world is there without even trying
they<00:02:34.220> can<00:02:34.400> get<00:02:34.519> homeless<00:02:35.049> for<00:02:36.049> UK<00:02:36.349> scientists

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
they can get homeless for UK scientists

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.650 
they can get homeless for UK scientists
there's<00:02:37.069> not<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> problem<00:02:37.459> with<00:02:37.730> cost<00:02:38.030> because

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
there's not a problem with cost because

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.770 
there's not a problem with cost because
all<00:02:39.019> UK<00:02:39.500> universities<00:02:40.130> are<00:02:40.310> signed<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.849> so

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
all UK universities are signed up so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.530 
all UK universities are signed up so
that's<00:02:41.989> not<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.319> problem<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.400> finally<00:02:44.239> one<00:02:44.510> of

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
that's not a problem and finally one of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.420 
that's not a problem and finally one of
the<00:02:44.660> moon<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.170> think<00:02:45.650> one<00:02:45.799> of<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.980> good<00:02:46.370> things

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
the moon I think one of the good things

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.110 
the moon I think one of the good things
about<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.120> whole<00:02:47.299> open<00:02:47.660> access<00:02:48.819> push<00:02:49.819> at<00:02:50.090> the

about the whole open access push at the

about the whole open access push at the
moment<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:50.989> breaking<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:51.680> and

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
moment is that it's breaking up and

moment is that it's breaking up and

publishers which are can be described as

ripping off scientists and the public by
