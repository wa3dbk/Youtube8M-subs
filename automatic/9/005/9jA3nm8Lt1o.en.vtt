I<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:07.880> we've<00:03:08.000> got<00:03:08.180> movement<00:03:08.450> there's<00:03:08.960> a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
I think we've got movement there's a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.630 
I think we've got movement there's a
little<00:03:09.230> firm<00:03:09.530> on<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.890> opposite<00:03:10.220> side<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.490> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
little firm on the opposite side of the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.900 
little firm on the opposite side of the
road<00:03:10.790> also<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.980> nearest<00:03:13.370> underground

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
road also the nearest underground

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.870 
road also the nearest underground
station<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.350> must<00:03:15.710> be<00:03:15.830> classified<00:03:16.520> right

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
station so this must be classified right

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:34.120 
station so this must be classified right
yeah<00:03:17.240> they're<00:03:17.450> still<00:03:17.630> coming<00:03:17.900> down<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.050> pub

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.620 

they're<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.520> being<00:03:34.760> predictable<00:03:35.330> they're

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
they're not being predictable they're

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.390 
they're not being predictable they're
not<00:03:35.780> going<00:03:35.990> to<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.170> closest<00:03:36.650> station

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
not going to the closest station

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.740 
not going to the closest station
I<00:03:37.430> suppose<00:03:37.910> they<00:03:38.060> think<00:03:38.300> they're<00:03:38.450> given<00:03:38.660> the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
I suppose they think they're given the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.780 
I suppose they think they're given the
place<00:03:38.960> to<00:03:39.140> run<00:03:39.290> around<00:03:39.410> there<00:03:39.800> changing<00:03:40.520> and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
place to run around there changing and

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.700 
place to run around there changing and
changing<00:03:40.970> again<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.440> given<00:03:42.680> the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
changing again I think that given the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.630 
changing again I think that given the
place<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.220> run<00:03:43.370> around

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640
