00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
use gold on opening the map up and we're

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680 
use gold on opening the map up and we're
running<00:00:37.800> low<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.010> sort<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> mercenary<00:00:39.239> basis

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
running low on sort of mercenary basis

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
running low on sort of mercenary basis
which<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:40.980> i<00:00:41.010> think<00:00:41.129> we're<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
which you know i think we're going to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.770 
which you know i think we're going to
start<00:00:41.850> clearing<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> these

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
start clearing out a lot of these

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
start clearing out a lot of these
blackguard<00:00:43.290> basis<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:44.070> after<00:00:44.370> this

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
blackguard basis and i think after this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
blackguard basis and i think after this
video<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.570> next<00:00:45.930> next<00:00:46.710> video<00:00:46.980> we'll<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.100> back

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
video the next next video we'll go back

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.060 
video the next next video we'll go back
to<00:00:47.370> our<00:00:47.520> mixed<00:00:47.879> army<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.270> heavies<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
to our mixed army of heavies and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.290 
to our mixed army of heavies and
riflemen<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> Zukas<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.760> clear<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
riflemen and Zukas and clear some of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
riflemen and Zukas and clear some of
those<00:00:51.420> black<00:00:51.660> air<00:00:51.840> bases<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.590> we've

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
those black air bases but for now we've

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
those black air bases but for now we've
got<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> boost<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.090> our<00:00:54.329> masterpiece<00:00:55.020> for

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
got a boost going on our masterpiece for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
got a boost going on our masterpiece for
troop<00:00:55.410> health<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.980> we've<00:00:56.160> doubled<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
troop health so we've doubled it to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.049 
troop health so we've doubled it to
fifty<00:00:57.000> six<00:00:57.180> percent<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:59.070> boost

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
fifty six percent and we got a boost

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
fifty six percent and we got a boost
going<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> resource<00:01:00.840> reward<00:01:01.260> we're<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.920> at

going on a resource reward we're now at

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.529 
going on a resource reward we're now at
plus<00:01:02.550> eighty<00:01:02.699> eight<00:01:02.850> percent<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.420> should

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
plus eighty eight percent so that should

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
plus eighty eight percent so that should
be<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.129> ton<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
be good and if we look we have a ton a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.690 
be good and if we look we have a ton a
ton<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.600> power<00:01:06.990> powder<00:01:07.290> okay<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.400> because

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
ton of power powder okay that's because

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090 
ton of power powder okay that's because
we<00:01:08.909> keep<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.420> duplicate<00:01:10.100> masterpieces

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
we keep getting duplicate masterpieces

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
we keep getting duplicate masterpieces
that<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> reclaim<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.600> seven

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that we have to reclaim you get seven

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
that we have to reclaim you get seven
power<00:01:13.260> powders<00:01:13.710> every<00:01:14.010> time<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> reclaim

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
power powders every time you reclaim

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
power powders every time you reclaim
okay<00:01:18.170> okay<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> bases<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
okay okay so the bases we're going to go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
okay okay so the bases we're going to go
after<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.689> we're<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:22.110> based<00:01:22.350> on

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
after here we're just going based on

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.760 
after here we're just going based on
level<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.970> we've<00:01:24.119> got<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.630> some<00:01:25.140> level<00:01:25.380> 36

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
level so we've got some some level 36

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
level so we've got some some level 36
bases<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.490> those<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> lowest<00:01:26.909> level

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
bases I think those are the lowest level

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.749 
bases I think those are the lowest level
basis<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.009> attack<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
basis that we have that we can attack so

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.660 
basis that we have that we can attack so
we'll<00:01:30.509> probably<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.810> bring<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.670> rates

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
we'll probably just bring them in rates

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.789 
we'll probably just bring them in rates
here<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.689> trying<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.259> figure<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
here and I'm trying to figure out the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.819 
here and I'm trying to figure out the
best<00:01:35.070> place<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> bring<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.060> guys<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.299> that's

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
best place to bring these guys in that's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
they're pretty easy to use man they're

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.490 
they're pretty easy to use man they're
pretty<00:02:36.610> easy<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:37.000> use<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.330> know<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.380> you

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
pretty easy to use I know some of you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.199 
pretty easy to use I know some of you
have<00:02:38.590> mentioned<00:02:38.890> that's<00:02:39.310> they're<00:02:39.700> not<00:02:39.910> that

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
have mentioned that's they're not that

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.979 
have mentioned that's they're not that
easy<00:02:40.480> really<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:41.680> um<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.190> don't<00:02:43.120> know<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.450> find

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
easy really but um I don't know I find

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.910 
easy really but um I don't know I find
them<00:02:44.280> pretty<00:02:45.280> overpowered<00:02:45.880> if<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.360> ask<00:02:46.480> me<00:02:46.920> ok

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
them pretty overpowered if you ask me ok

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.160 
them pretty overpowered if you ask me ok
so<00:02:47.980> our<00:02:48.459> radar<00:02:49.239> what<00:02:49.660> do<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:49.810> need<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.080> upgrade

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
so our radar what do we need to upgrade

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.470 
so our radar what do we need to upgrade
we<00:02:50.590> need<00:02:50.739> another<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.489> hundred<00:02:51.940> thousand<00:02:52.360> would

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
we need another a hundred thousand would

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.660 
we need another a hundred thousand would
basically<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.620> we've<00:02:53.739> got<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.190> more<00:02:54.220> attack

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
basically so we've got one more attack

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.440 
basically so we've got one more attack
to<00:02:54.910> do<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.860> again<00:02:56.860> we'll<00:02:57.070> just<00:02:57.280> look<00:02:57.790> at<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to do and again we'll just look at that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.539 
to do and again we'll just look at that
guy's<00:02:59.260> not<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.739> give<00:03:00.010> us<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.280> hundred

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
guy's not going to give us a hundred

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.000 
guy's not going to give us a hundred
thousand<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.480> we<00:03:01.720> basically<00:03:01.870> need<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.799> look

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
thousand so we basically need if we look

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.810 
thousand so we basically need if we look
at<00:03:03.160> some<00:03:03.519> our<00:03:04.230> resource<00:03:05.230> reward<00:03:05.769> or<00:03:06.010> increase

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
at some our resource reward or increase

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.120 
at some our resource reward or increase
we<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:08.140> over<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.530> hundred<00:03:08.860> percent

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
we get just over a hundred percent

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.940 
we get just over a hundred percent
increase<00:03:09.850> right<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.660> we<00:03:10.900> need<00:03:11.079> approximately

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
increase right so we need approximately

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.340 
increase right so we need approximately
50,000<00:03:12.700> would<00:03:13.329> we<00:03:13.540> need<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.780> attack<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.200> base

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
50,000 would we need to attack the base

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.350 
50,000 would we need to attack the base
with<00:03:14.620> approximately<00:03:15.250> 50,000<00:03:15.820> would<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.150> looks

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
with approximately 50,000 would it looks

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.539 
with approximately 50,000 would it looks
like<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.840> probably<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.530> good<00:03:17.829> base<00:03:18.310> to

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
like this is probably a good base to

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.920 
like this is probably a good base to
attack<00:03:18.790> let's<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.239> check<00:03:19.450> them<00:03:19.600> out<00:03:19.690> here

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
attack let's just check them out here

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.740 
attack let's just check them out here
and<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:22.239> fog<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.600> war<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.440> stuck<00:03:24.390> alright<00:03:25.390> so

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and the fog of war is stuck alright so

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.780 
and the fog of war is stuck alright so
let's<00:03:25.959> try<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.470> again<00:03:28.470> come<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:30.519> need<00:03:30.549> to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
let's try that again come on we need to

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.590 
let's try that again come on we need to
we<00:03:31.209> need<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.420> check<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.600> space<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:32.019> let's<00:03:32.950> go

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
we need to check the space out let's go

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.819 
we need to check the space out let's go
