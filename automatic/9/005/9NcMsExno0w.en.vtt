standing right next to the background
we're<00:03:00.920> gonna<00:03:01.040> probably<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.610> background

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
we're gonna probably see the background

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.390 
we're gonna probably see the background
so<00:03:02.540> if<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:03.080> we<00:03:03.140> lure<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.739> cat<00:03:03.920> out<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.160> little

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
was great it was unpredictable and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.810 
was great it was unpredictable and
because<00:03:27.680> we<00:03:27.799> introduced<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.280> element<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
because we introduced this element the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.729 
because we introduced this element the
cat<00:03:29.000> responded<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.930> it's<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.440> little<00:03:30.620> head

a<00:03:50.909> lot<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.209> people<00:03:51.450> complain<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:52.650> are

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
a lot of people complain that there are

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.339 
a lot of people complain that there are
photos<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.190> black<00:03:53.370> cats<00:03:53.640> all<00:03:54.299> right<00:03:54.420> focus<00:03:54.720> and

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
photos of black cats all right focus and

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.289 
photos of black cats all right focus and
it's<00:03:55.769> not<00:03:55.950> necessarily<00:03:56.519> because<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.120> cats

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
it's not necessarily because the cats

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.479 
it's not necessarily because the cats
are<00:03:57.480> too<00:03:57.599> fast<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.680> because<00:03:58.799> your<00:03:59.220> shutter

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
are too fast it's because your shutter

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.949 
are too fast it's because your shutter
speed<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.909> too<00:04:00.090> slow<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.599> if<00:04:00.750> you're<00:04:00.870> working

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
speed is too slow so if you're working

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.930 
speed is too slow so if you're working
with<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.230> point<00:04:01.470> shoot<00:04:01.709> camera<00:04:02.040> put<00:04:02.849> the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
with the point shoot camera put the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.580 
with the point shoot camera put the
camera<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:03.390> sports<00:04:03.720> mode<00:04:03.959> that'll<00:04:04.409> usually

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
camera in sports mode that'll usually

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.530 
camera in sports mode that'll usually
crank<00:04:05.099> up<00:04:05.220> your<00:04:05.280> ISO<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.030> get<00:04:06.120> faster

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
crank up your ISO and you get faster

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.210 
crank up your ISO and you get faster
shutter<00:04:06.690> speeds<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.260> way<00:04:07.410> Henry's<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.829> focus

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
shutter speeds that way Henry's in focus

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.039 
shutter speeds that way Henry's in focus
