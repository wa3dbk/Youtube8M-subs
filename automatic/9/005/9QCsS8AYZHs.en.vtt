army

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.819 
army
so<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> strengths<00:00:39.300> tend<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.809> you're<00:00:40.530> very

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so the strengths tend to be you're very

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.940 
so the strengths tend to be you're very
bold<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> comes<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.629> tactics<00:00:42.950> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
bold when it comes to your tactics you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
bold when it comes to your tactics you
you're<00:00:44.309> flat-out<00:00:44.670> utility<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> rush

you're flat-out utility like to rush

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.799 
you're flat-out utility like to rush
across<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> table<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> you're<00:00:48.570> very

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
across the table so you're very

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.830 
across the table so you're very
aggressive<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> good<00:00:50.489> trait<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840

very<00:00:52.110> angry<00:00:52.770> type<00:00:53.039> general<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.879> at

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
very angry type general if you will at

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.549 
very angry type general if you will at
the<00:00:54.809> same<00:00:54.960> time<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.850> use<00:00:57.180> ace<00:00:57.600> units<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the same time you use ace units so you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
the same time you use ace units so you
use<00:00:58.969> hard-hitting<00:00:59.969> units<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> tend<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> roll

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
use hard-hitting units that tend to roll

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
use hard-hitting units that tend to roll
over<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.620> opponent<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.520> cannot

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
stop them they basically just run

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.350 
stop them they basically just run
through<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> entire<00:01:07.619> army<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.060> very

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

table and go hey see that unit right

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.790 
table and go hey see that unit right
there

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
there

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.830 
there
I<00:02:01.830> killed<00:02:02.400> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> first<00:02:02.850> assault<00:02:03.120> phase<00:02:03.360> get

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I killed in the first assault phase get

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.140 
I killed in the first assault phase get
it<00:02:03.930> off<00:02:04.050> my<00:02:04.560> table<00:02:04.830> that's<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:05.970> you

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
it off my table that's the way you

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.010 
it off my table that's the way you
aggressive<00:02:06.570> players<00:02:06.840> play<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.869> because<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
aggressive players play so because of

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320 
aggressive players play so because of
this<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.740> high<00:02:11.310> costing<00:02:11.790> units<00:02:12.120> which

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
this you have high costing units which

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.070 
this you have high costing units which
equals<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.960> lower<00:02:13.410> number<00:02:13.710> count<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.220> your<00:02:14.430> army

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
equals a lower number count in your army

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.690 
equals a lower number count in your army
now<00:02:16.080> again<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.740> not<00:02:16.800> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> say<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.610> this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
now again I'm not going to say that this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
now again I'm not going to say that this
is<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.150> every<00:02:18.660> single<00:02:18.930> aggressive<00:02:19.410> player

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
is for every single aggressive player

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.500 
is for every single aggressive player
but<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> generalization<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.209> I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
but this is the generalization that I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.440 
but this is the generalization that I
see<00:02:22.580> again<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> weakness<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.300> they're

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
see again the weakness is that they're

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.260 
see again the weakness is that they're
very<00:02:24.480> easy<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> Bluff<00:02:25.620> because<00:02:26.130> remember<00:02:26.490> if

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
very easy to Bluff because remember if

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.150 
very easy to Bluff because remember if
we<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> very<00:02:27.990> aggressive<00:02:28.140> person<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
we have a very aggressive person and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.699 
we have a very aggressive person and
he's<00:02:29.490> translating<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.450> anger<00:02:30.900> or<00:02:31.350> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
he's translating that anger or that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.970 
he's translating that anger or that
aggressiveness<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.700> he<00:02:32.910> personally<00:02:33.270> has

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
aggressiveness that he personally has

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.970 
aggressiveness that he personally has
onto<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> tabletop<00:02:35.459> he's<00:02:36.330> quick<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> anger

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
onto the tabletop he's quick to anger

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.210 
onto the tabletop he's quick to anger
he's<00:02:37.980> he's<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.580> very<00:02:39.090> rational<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.070> very

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
he's he's not very rational so it's very

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820 
he's he's not very rational so it's very
easy<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.670> Bluff<00:02:42.209> people<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.650> very

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
easy to Bluff people like this it's very

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.060 
easy to Bluff people like this it's very
easy<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.870> work<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.230> get<00:02:46.410> them<00:02:46.470> up<00:02:46.620> very

an opponent you basically have to keep
in<00:03:20.250> mind<00:03:20.460> that<00:03:20.580> they<00:03:20.730> tend<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.120> crutch

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
in mind that they tend to have crutch

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.390 
in mind that they tend to have crutch
units<00:03:21.990> that<00:03:22.080> they<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.620> rely<00:03:22.920> on<00:03:22.950> things

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
units that they really rely on things

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.480 
units that they really rely on things
that<00:03:23.550> they<00:03:23.730> take<00:03:23.970> pride<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:25.100> people<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.280> have

can end up doing is well basically using
your<00:04:47.050> army<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.560> channeling<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.040> like<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> focus

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
your army and channeling it like a focus

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.640 
your army and channeling it like a focus
beam<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.510> break<00:04:49.840> one<00:04:50.110> unit<00:04:50.440> at<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.620> time

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
beam you break one unit at a time

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.320 
beam you break one unit at a time
because<00:04:51.190> there's<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:51.610> not<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.880> much<00:04:52.270> to

actually get rid of off the table

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.670 
actually get rid of off the table
because<00:04:54.160> they<00:04:54.310> tend<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.580> have<00:04:54.699> smaller<00:04:55.090> armies

to be unrelenting with your assaults

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.490 
to be unrelenting with your assaults
just<00:05:03.699> because<00:05:03.970> you<00:05:04.120> start<00:05:04.360> taking<00:05:05.260> casualties

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
just because you start taking casualties

just because you start taking casualties
it<00:05:06.220> doesn't<00:05:06.639> mean<00:05:06.789> that<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.000> game<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.360> over

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
and at the same time it doesn't mean

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.219 
and at the same time it doesn't mean
that<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.520> should<00:05:09.699> go<00:05:09.850> run<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.720> hide<00:05:10.930> into<00:05:11.199> a
