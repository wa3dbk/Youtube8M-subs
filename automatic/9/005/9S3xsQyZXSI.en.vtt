00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.552
 I have a lot of stories about them. 

00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:05.929
 I took my children on horseback, right? 

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:07.014
 It was like, 

00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:09.725
 the best, worst day I had with children. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.977
 I wanted to find a place suitable for children and adults, 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.354
 that we should make good use of this day. 

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:14.938
 I found this ranch, no? 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.567
 Me, my children, my brother, my friends, we all went. 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.527
 We arrive, they have ponies. 

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:23.405
 My children are getting on ponies. There is a smaller route on the ranch. 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.282
 They drive ponies on a smaller route. 

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.077
 Me, my brother and friends are getting on bigger horses. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.496
 We will drive on a larger route, ok? 

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.831
 Here's what happened. They all got on horses. 

00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:35.000
 Everyone has feet in stirrups. They are ready. 

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.503
 I got in the last one because I had to fill in the papers, 

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:38.587
 I pay for it. 

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.798
 I get on my horse. That was my problem. 

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.051
 I want to put my feet into the stirrups, right? 

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:46.261
 Ok. Ok, that was the problem. 

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:49.431
 When I put this foot in, I could not. 

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:52.142
 I could not put both in, okay? 

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.354
 So I'm telling the guy. I say, "Hey, I think I need smaller stirrups." 

00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:57.022
 He said, "Do not be afraid, you do not need." 

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:58.565
 I say, "Yes, I need it. 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.901
 "Everyone has them, I do not want to stand out." 

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:02.820
 He said, "Trust, everything will be fine." 

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:05.739
 I say, "I do not trust you. I want to look like others." 

00:01:06.073 --> 00:01:07.783
 He asked, "Listen, do I have to call an instructor?" 

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.618
 I said, "Yes, I want to talk to him." 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.955
 Remember that I chose this ranch because of him. 

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.832
 He should be horse guru. 

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:16.709
 He was to teach us how to physically control a horse. 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 He was to teach us verbal commands and 

00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:20.379
 he personally would take us on the trail. 

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:24.133
 The problem is that he did not speak English, okay? 

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.592
 This can not be fake. 

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:28.929
 He said something like this before we left. 

00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:31.098
 Word for word. He says, 

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:33.434
 "Okay. 

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.854
 "Okay. 

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:43.861
 "Okay. 

00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:48.866
 "Oh yes, move, fat, kick! 

00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:51.201
 "Yes, kick double. 

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:54.329
 "Oh yes, it's fine, driving." 

00:01:57.916 --> 00:02:00.252
 "What the fuck did he say? Did you understand something? 

00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:03.672
 "Hey, you have to do it again, I did not understand." 

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:04.840
 Here's how I knew he was fucking. 

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:06.675
 He said it in the same way. 

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:10.471
 He said, "Okay, Okay. 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.684
 "Okay, okay. 

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:20.397
 "Oh yes, move, fat, kick! 

00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:22.649
 "Yes, kick double. 

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.277
 "Oh yes, it's fine, driving." 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.573
 I said, "We'll die, fuck, we'll be killed." 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.284
 A colleague said, "Kev, stop moaning. Let's go now." 

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:34.161
 Remember that I have no stability. 

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:37.122
 My feet hang from the side of my horse. 

00:02:37.164 --> 00:02:38.874
 I do not have anything to catch, 

00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:42.127
 in addition to this small stump protruding from the saddle. 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.463
 I said, "Okay, I'm not saying anything anymore. Let's go." 

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:46.882
 My horse starts to trot. 

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:48.926
 It is not running. Trots. 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.011
 I do not have a balance, so I fly everywhere. 

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.971
 I look like this, no? 

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:55.057
 My feet kicked my horse in the stomach. 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.935
 It's a sign to speed up. 

00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:00.187
 My horse starts. 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.441
 Listen to me. That fucker started chasing. 

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:07.361
 Now I'm scared because I do not know what to do with my feet. 

00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:10.364
 In one of the moments I panicked, I had feet on his neck. 

00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:13.492
 I sat there, no? I sat there. 

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:15.536
 I did not hear anything, the wind was blowing. 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:17.705
 It was like ... 

00:03:17.788 --> 00:03:19.248
 I heard colleagues from behind. It sounded like ... 

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.378
 I do not know what they said. 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.631
 I suspected they said, "Let go." 

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.009
 I thought they said, "Let go." 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.721
 So I said, "Fuck it, Jesus take the reins." Right? 

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:37.057
 I'm flying like a black desert runner. 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:40.644
 My ... The horse is still going. 

00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:44.106
 My friends and my brother, the instructor, all stop by my side. 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.524
 This is the moment when I'm pissed off. 

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:47.818
 I say, "Yo, I'm not doing this anymore. 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.403
 "Fuck this trail. I'm done. 

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:52.656
 "I'm going back, I'm going for children, I'm going back to the hotel." 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.743
 My fellow Spank said, "Kev, you can not go back on foot. 

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.286
 "We were driving for about 25 minutes. 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.121
 "It will take you an hour to get back." 

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.373
 I said, "Cool." I looked at the instructor, 

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:04.043
 I said, "Then take me with you, take me back." 

00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:07.629
 He puts his hand in that way, heches me, pulls me in and picks me up, 

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.340
 he puts me on his horse. 

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:12.634
 That's why I will never go horse again. 

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:16.597
 For 25 minutes, for 25 fucking minutes, 

00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:18.932
 I'm in the back of this horse. 

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.445
 I'm turning around, my friends think it's funny. 

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:33.489
 They take pictures, no? 

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:36.116
 I said, "Put down the camera, put away the damn camera!" 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.203
 The instructor kicked his horse in the stomach, the horse begins to run. 

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:43.290
 He turns his hand, I grab my back and pull me to my side, no? 

00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:48.337
 I'm scared, so I can not let go, I'm holding his stomach. 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.799
 I'm fucking him in the back as much as I can. 

00:04:51.882 --> 00:04:55.219
 He is accelerating, I am accelerating. I shot him 75 times. 

00:04:57.137 --> 00:04:59.765
 It pissed me that in the middle of it, 

00:04:59.807 --> 00:05:02.309
 he turns and says, "Driving." 

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:04.144
 I said, "Dude, fuck off me." 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:06.480
 New York was great. My name is Kev Hart. 

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.482
 I love you all. 

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.985
 I appreciate you. Thank you. 

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:15.155
 Give it another try. 

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:16.990
 Thank you New York. 

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:30.337
 Before I go, 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.756
 I will finish it 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.426
 something straight from the heart. 

00:05:35.843 --> 00:05:40.222
 I do not want to spill or something. 

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:43.684
 People, I'm one of several 

00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:49.940
 comedians who performed at Madison fucking Square Garden. [about 30k people] 

00:05:53.193 --> 00:05:54.528
 Hi.. 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.032
 Listen to me. 

00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:00.284
 You have no idea about 

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:04.079
 the feeling that now passes through my body. 

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:07.666
 The fucking dream has come true. 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.302
 Hey, this is a fucking dream that's come true. 

00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:21.722
 Thank you for being loyal. Thank you for growing up with me. 

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.391
 Thank you for liking me. 

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:26.894
 My name is Kev Hart, I love all of you. 

00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:41.154
