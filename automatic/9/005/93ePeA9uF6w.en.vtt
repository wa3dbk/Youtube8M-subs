of<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.940> texture

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of this one not with not like texture

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080 
of this one not with not like texture
wise<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.860> also<00:00:38.010> had<00:00:38.280> these<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.820> rock

wise but that also had these like rock
formations<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:44.190> would<00:00:44.309> basically<00:00:44.460> fight

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
formations and you would basically fight

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.170 
formations and you would basically fight
between<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.420> rocky<00:00:45.750> pillars<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
between these rocky pillars it's not a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.459 
between these rocky pillars it's not a
lot<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:48.989> shooting

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.729 

this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.620> actually<00:00:52.950> a<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.340> big<00:00:53.790> map<00:00:54.739> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
this is actually a pretty big map you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
this is actually a pretty big map you
wouldn't<00:00:56.040> think<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.610> first<00:00:56.640> seeing<00:00:57.420> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
wouldn't think so at first seeing this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.850 
wouldn't think so at first seeing this
but<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> actually<00:00:58.140> is

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:15.740 

oh<00:01:03.950> shit

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
now they do have a little bit different

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.609 
now they do have a little bit different
skin<00:01:19.299> color<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.979> droids<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.350> can<00:01:23.470> see

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
skin color the the droids you can see

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.289 
skin color the the droids you can see
that<00:01:23.740> they<00:01:23.830> have<00:01:23.860> interesting<00:01:24.430> spawn<00:01:24.729> places

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
that they have interesting spawn places

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.149 
that they have interesting spawn places
not<00:01:26.049> everything<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.590> immediately<00:01:27.040> available

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
not everything is immediately available

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.289 
not everything is immediately available
in<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.610> beginning<00:01:27.729> but<00:01:28.000> they<00:01:28.149> have<00:01:28.270> a

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
in the beginning but they have a

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.550 
in the beginning but they have a
straight<00:01:28.659> line<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.080> we<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:31.289> little<00:01:32.289> admit

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
straight line and we have a little admit

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.419 
straight line and we have a little admit
were<00:01:32.680> mixed<00:01:32.950> up<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.770> was<00:01:38.979> actually<00:01:39.399> another

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
were mixed up there was actually another

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.730 
were mixed up there was actually another
one<00:01:40.060> another<00:01:40.390> Geno's<00:01:40.960> as<00:01:41.200> level<00:01:41.439> that<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.590> did

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
one another Geno's as level that I did

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.649 
one another Geno's as level that I did
which<00:01:41.920> also<00:01:42.130> not<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.729> one<00:01:42.880> with<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.090> with<00:01:43.479> the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
which also not the one with the with the

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.359 
which also not the one with the with the
fucked<00:01:43.960> up<00:01:44.110> textures<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.710> ground<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.250> it

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
fucked up textures on the ground but it

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.600 
fucked up textures on the ground but it
was<00:01:45.490> also<00:01:45.670> very<00:01:45.820> similar<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.399> just

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
was also very similar to this it just

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.969 
was also very similar to this it just
feels<00:01:48.729> like<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.940> big<00:01:49.270> big<00:01:49.479> issue<00:01:49.630> also<00:01:49.990> because

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
feels like a big big issue also because

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.309 
feels like a big big issue also because
that<00:01:51.220> was<00:01:51.399> heavily<00:01:51.759> infantry<00:01:52.270> based<00:01:52.509> but

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
that was heavily infantry based but

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.609 
that was heavily infantry based but
there<00:01:53.530> were<00:01:53.619> actually<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.009> lot<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.640> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
there were actually a lot of like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.199 
there were actually a lot of like
vehicles<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:56.799> you<00:01:56.920> could<00:01:57.100> get<00:01:57.310> there<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:57.759> the

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
vehicles that you could get there so the

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.850 
vehicles that you could get there so the
strategic<00:01:58.630> element<00:01:58.959> would<00:01:59.080> be<00:01:59.319> that<00:01:59.830> you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
strategic element would be that you

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.010 
strategic element would be that you
would<00:02:00.220> use<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.700> vehicles<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:01.360> press<00:02:01.810> on

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
would use the vehicles to just press on

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.430 
would use the vehicles to just press on
or<00:02:02.830> two<00:02:03.159> whoa<00:02:03.549> why<00:02:04.420> are<00:02:04.479> we<00:02:04.659> capturing<00:02:05.049> on<00:02:05.140> why

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
or two whoa why are we capturing on why

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.990 
or two whoa why are we capturing on why
did<00:02:05.619> we<00:02:05.679> lose<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:05.920> point<00:02:06.340> that's<00:02:06.610> kind<00:02:06.970> of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
did we lose that point that's kind of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.389 
did we lose that point that's kind of
interesting<00:02:07.530> another<00:02:08.530> command<00:02:08.920> post<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.220> the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
I'll see the map how do we know what I

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.570 
I'll see the map how do we know what I
took<00:04:29.270> both<00:04:29.600> those<00:04:30.250> points<00:04:31.250> all<00:04:31.400> right<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:37.550> are

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.189 
took both those points all right we are
actually<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.300> was<00:04:38.539> about<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.960> say<00:04:39.050> we<00:04:39.169> are

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
actually I was about to say we are

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.510 
actually I was about to say we are
winning<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.620> pretty<00:04:39.860> well<00:04:40.039> but<00:04:40.160> we<00:04:40.400> are

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
actually um going pretty same route we

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.860 
actually um going pretty same route we
are<00:04:44.389> ahead<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.930> little<00:04:45.080> bit<00:04:45.740> but<00:04:46.750> just<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.840> few

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
are ahead a little bit but just a few

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.260 
are ahead a little bit but just a few
well-placed<00:04:48.550> droidy<00:04:49.550> cos<00:04:49.699> or<00:04:49.880> whatever<00:04:50.150> and

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
well-placed droidy cos or whatever and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.420 
well-placed droidy cos or whatever and
they<00:04:50.360> can<00:04:50.539> they<00:04:50.960> can<00:04:50.990> do<00:04:51.139> a<00:04:51.169> lot<00:04:51.349> of<00:04:51.380> damage

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.379 

which<00:04:55.430> kind<00:04:55.639> of<00:04:55.699> proves<00:04:55.880> that<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.270> is

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
which kind of proves that this is

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.150 
which kind of proves that this is
actually<00:04:56.509> a<00:04:56.750> map<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.169> can<00:04:57.349> very<00:04:57.800> well<00:04:57.860> we

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
actually a map that can very well we

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:09.200 
actually a map that can very well we
play<00:04:58.370> with<00:04:58.580> AI<00:05:00.520> it's<00:05:01.520> very<00:05:01.729> balanced

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.390
