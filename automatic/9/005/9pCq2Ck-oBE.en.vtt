slimmer<00:02:16.069> than<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.610> Powerbank<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:17.959> can

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
slimmer than this Powerbank so you can

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.500 
slimmer than this Powerbank so you can
carry<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.560> along<00:02:19.100> with<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> Powerbank<00:02:19.910> this

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
carry it along with the Powerbank this

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.980 
carry it along with the Powerbank this
is<00:02:20.660> just<00:02:21.220> frankly<00:02:22.220> speaking<00:02:22.340> guys<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:23.600> feels

like an iPhone 5s literally feels like
an<00:02:27.830> iPhone<00:02:28.130> Pyrus<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:29.810> very<00:02:30.350> good<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
an iPhone Pyrus so very very good the I

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.930 
an iPhone Pyrus so very very good the I
would<00:02:32.150> say<00:02:32.180> construction<00:02:32.930> Xiaomi<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:34.819> is

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
would say construction Xiaomi this is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.199 
would say construction Xiaomi this is
the<00:02:35.180> T<00:02:35.600> ape<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.140> remove<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:38.090> is

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
the T ape you have to remove so this is

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.250 
the T ape you have to remove so this is
the<00:02:38.270> tape<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:42.910> these<00:02:43.910> are<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.330> ports<00:02:44.840> as<00:02:45.110> you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
the tape and these are the ports as you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.140 
the tape and these are the ports as you
can<00:02:45.440> see<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> USB<00:02:46.610> port<00:02:46.880> for

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
can see this is the USB port for

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.420 
can see this is the USB port for
charging<00:02:47.180> other<00:02:47.840> devices<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.250> the
