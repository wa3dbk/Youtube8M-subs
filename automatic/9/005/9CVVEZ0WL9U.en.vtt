00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.370

 they are two styles for Real Madrid and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.710
 also 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.750
 demand 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.750
 it was two seconds three times more 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:15.629
 the anger of the club is reduced in two 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.519
 seconds of the game a play of the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.519
 general of the show of the two 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.500
 editions of everything except niceties 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.480
 they are less 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.730
 to see now that it's a pretty way to 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.730
 finish the match the referees leave 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.870

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.210
 write down the first 2 above now create 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.240
 and when seconds three tenths 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.930
 we have a navarro it seems that is the one 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.610
 the 74 72 technique has gone with the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.569
