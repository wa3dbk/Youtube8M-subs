00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.530
 this file that is a point rar file 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.020

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.780
 we have nothing else to give right button 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.330

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.190
 on behalf of the trigger point file 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.950
 win 8 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.950
 and well, you have to bring it 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.709
 after extracting we will appear 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.709
 two folders 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.120
 one with which we had downloaded the 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:51.159
 compressed file that is the point rar and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.159
 the other a folder wherever 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.480
 it was decompressed 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 not to go again 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.340
 unzip so that it does not happen too much 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.340
 the program 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.310
 in this part because it only remains to give 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.310
 double click 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.700
 and will ask us to accept the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.220
 permits and we're going to give permission to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.370
 file to run without any 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.269
 problem 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.269
 we do not need 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.019
 and it tells us that it is being extracted 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.019
 any doubt that they have then 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.790
 could support in schuringa dotcom or 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.900
 so good to beat the page you 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.239

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.700
 they will be able to ask questions without 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.470
 no problem and then there I am going to 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.300
 to can help 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.590
 you have to wait for a moment when you 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.590
 finish loading 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.290
 pause the video so it will not be late 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.400
 Well, right now we finished 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.000

 where it says english 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.099
