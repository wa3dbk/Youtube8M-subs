version of the xbox is going to come out
with<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.530> let's<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.579> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> start<00:00:45.090> off<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
with so let's first kind of start off a

with so let's first kind of start off a
respect<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.559> full<00:00:47.010> respect<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.730> xbox

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
respect we are full respect for the xbox

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
respect we are full respect for the xbox
Xbox<00:00:49.410> 720<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.460> supposed<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> come

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
Xbox 720 we know it's supposed to come

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
Xbox 720 we know it's supposed to come
with<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> 1.6<00:00:51.750> gigahertz<00:00:52.079> eight-core

with a 1.6 gigahertz eight-core
processor<00:00:53.660> supposed<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.840> about<00:00:55.050> 8

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
processor supposed to have about 8

gigabytes of ddr3 RAM aside and supposed

gigabytes of ddr3 RAM aside and supposed
to<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.949> an<00:00:59.070> AMD<00:00:59.370> GPU<00:01:00.120> clocked<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.780> 800

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to have an AMD GPU clocked at about 800

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.009 
to have an AMD GPU clocked at about 800
megahertz<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.489> respects<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.270> make

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
megahertz now these respects here make

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
megahertz now these respects here make
sense<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.100> probably<00:01:05.489> pretty<00:01:06.000> accurate

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
sense and it's probably pretty accurate

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
sense and it's probably pretty accurate
because<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.439> very<00:01:07.590> close<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> specs

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
because it's very close to the specs

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.880 
because it's very close to the specs
that<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.439> PlayStation<00:01:10.439> off<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that are in the PlayStation off or

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
that are in the PlayStation off or
already<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> same<00:01:11.850> sort<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.330> core

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
already with the same sort of a core

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
already with the same sort of a core
processor<00:01:13.200> 8<00:01:13.710> gigabytes<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> RAM<00:01:14.640> inside<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
processor 8 gigabytes of RAM inside of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.249 
processor 8 gigabytes of RAM inside of
it<00:01:15.240> although<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> ramp<00:01:15.780> speeds<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> little

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it although the ramp speeds are a little

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.370 
it although the ramp speeds are a little
bit<00:01:16.439> different<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.610> AMD<00:01:18.380> GPU

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
bit different there and in AMD GPU

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
bit different there and in AMD GPU
inside<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.890> makes<00:01:20.460> sense<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.880> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
inside of it makes sense because it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.880 
inside of it makes sense because it's
probably<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.869> developers<00:01:22.290> requesting

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
probably more developers requesting

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
probably more developers requesting
similar<00:01:23.310> hardware<00:01:23.490> platforms<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
similar hardware platforms to make it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.539 
similar hardware platforms to make it
much<00:01:24.689> easier<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.350> develop<00:01:25.470> games<00:01:26.009> especially

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
much easier to develop games especially

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
much easier to develop games especially
the<00:01:26.850> cross<00:01:27.119> platform<00:01:27.570> games<00:01:27.780> were<00:01:27.960> able<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the cross platform games were able to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
the cross platform games were able to
develop<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> game<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:29.340> able<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.329> easily<00:01:30.420> make

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
develop the game be able to easily make

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
develop the game be able to easily make
it<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> work<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.650> well<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.100> probably

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
it and work very well it's probably

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
it and work very well it's probably
gonna<00:01:32.460> save<00:01:32.640> time<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.180> money<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.630> able<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
gonna save time and money to be able to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.179 
gonna save time and money to be able to
do<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> maybe<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> game<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> little

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
do that maybe to make the game a little

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.850 
do that maybe to make the game a little
bit<00:01:35.280> cheaper<00:01:35.640> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> doubt<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
bit cheaper kind of doubt that but it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.289 
bit cheaper kind of doubt that but it
makes<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.790> lot<00:01:38.909> easier<00:01:39.060> for

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
makes it a just a lot easier for

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.640 
makes it a just a lot easier for
developers<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:39.780> games<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> hopefully

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
developers to make games and hopefully

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.480 
developers to make games and hopefully
the<00:01:40.740> games<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.009> come<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.340> bit

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the games will come out a little bit

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.929 
the games will come out a little bit
faster<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.150> way<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.649> believe<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.820> that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
faster that way so I I believe in that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
faster that way so I I believe in that
regard<00:01:45.270> those<00:01:45.540> specs<00:01:45.899> are<00:01:46.049> probably<00:01:46.619> very

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
regard those specs are probably very

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
regard those specs are probably very
very<00:01:47.250> accurate<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> other

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
very accurate now some of the other

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210 
very accurate now some of the other
specs<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> expect<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.040> bit

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
specs here we can expect a little bit

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
specs here we can expect a little bit
more<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.540> blu-ray<00:01:51.720> drive<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.439> supposed<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
more on the blu-ray drive is supposed to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
more on the blu-ray drive is supposed to
be<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:53.040> its<00:01:53.430> supposed<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> come<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
be with its supposed to come with a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.880 
be with its supposed to come with a
blu-ray<00:01:54.540> drive<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.899> support<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> 50<00:01:55.680> give

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
blu-ray drive to support up to 50 give

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
blu-ray drive to support up to 50 give
like<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:57.060> does<00:01:57.360> make<00:01:57.509> sense

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
like this that does make sense

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.999 
like this that does make sense
especially<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.409> they're<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.799> making

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
especially if they're going to be making

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.770 
especially if they're going to be making
on<00:01:59.310> next-gen

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
on next-gen

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.660 
on next-gen
games<00:01:59.960> with<00:02:00.170> better<00:02:00.380> graphics<00:02:00.650> on<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.190> it's

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
games with better graphics on it it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.280 
games with better graphics on it it's
gonna<00:02:01.760> need<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.270> storage<00:02:02.720> space<00:02:02.990> because

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
gonna need that storage space because

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.960 
gonna need that storage space because
you<00:02:03.409> know<00:02:03.799> 8<00:02:04.040> gigabytes<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.580> going<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.760> be<00:02:04.820> able

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
you know 8 gigabytes is going to be able

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.950 
you know 8 gigabytes is going to be able
to<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.180> anymore<00:02:05.479> you're<00:02:05.720> gonna<00:02:05.810> really

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
to do it anymore you're gonna really

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.800 
to do it anymore you're gonna really
going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.229> need<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:07.509> 1525<00:02:08.509> you

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
going to need that you know 1525 you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.270 
going to need that you know 1525 you
know<00:02:08.899> 50<00:02:09.200> gigabytes<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.649> storage<00:02:09.770> space<00:02:09.979> to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
know 50 gigabytes of storage space to

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.620 
know 50 gigabytes of storage space to
really<00:02:10.490> take<00:02:10.759> advantage<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.270> really<00:02:11.510> make

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
really take advantage and really make

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.449 
really take advantage and really make
some<00:02:11.780> very<00:02:12.110> good<00:02:12.410> content<00:02:12.920> games<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.340> some

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
some very good content games and some

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.309 
some very good content games and some
games<00:02:13.670> are<00:02:13.880> gonna<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.360> lot<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.840> depth<00:02:15.200> to

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
games are gonna have a lot of depth to

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.809 
games are gonna have a lot of depth to
them<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.860> lot<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> graphics<00:02:16.550> with<00:02:16.700> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
them and a lot of the graphics with it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.180 
them and a lot of the graphics with it
so<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.510> makes<00:02:17.870> sense<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.590> show<00:02:19.010> up

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
so that makes sense for that to show up

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.330 
so that makes sense for that to show up
on<00:02:19.400> their<00:02:20.200> also<00:02:21.200> kind<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.890> heard<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.130> little<00:02:22.220> bit

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
on their also kind of heard a little bit

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830 
on their also kind of heard a little bit
of<00:02:22.520> about<00:02:22.730> hard<00:02:23.030> drive<00:02:23.209> storage<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.690> this

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
of about hard drive storage with this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.900 
of about hard drive storage with this
was<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.110> 500<00:02:24.830> gigabytes<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.400> maybe<00:02:25.700> one

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
was the 500 gigabytes to maybe one

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.510 
was the 500 gigabytes to maybe one
terabyte<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.680> might<00:02:28.069> have<00:02:28.280> been<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
terabyte the that might have been the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.130 
terabyte the that might have been the
only<00:02:28.700> way<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.850> could<00:02:28.970> see<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.900> really

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
only way I could see that that really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.979 
only way I could see that that really
working<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.220> if<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.730> bluid<00:02:32.570> drivers

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
working is if if the bluid drivers

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.810 
working is if if the bluid drivers
remains<00:02:33.440> true<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.280> they're<00:02:34.700> going

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
remains true that you get they're going

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.160 
remains true that you get they're going
to<00:02:34.880> do<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.209> you're<00:02:35.570> gonna<00:02:35.660> want<00:02:35.900> install

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
to do that you're gonna want install

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.330 
to do that you're gonna want install
these<00:02:36.290> games<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.709> these<00:02:36.769> games<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.220> take

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
these games in these games going to take

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.640 
these games in these games going to take
a<00:02:37.370> lot<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.790> space<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.930> makes<00:02:39.350> sense<00:02:39.440> that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
a lot of space so it makes sense that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.870 
a lot of space so it makes sense that
you<00:02:39.769> can<00:02:39.890> use<00:02:40.010> something<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.220> 500<00:02:40.489> or

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
you can use something like 500 or

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.970 
you can use something like 500 or
terabytes<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.540> space<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.590> able<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.830> store

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
terabytes of space to be able to store

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.910 
terabytes of space to be able to store
these<00:02:43.130> games<00:02:43.510> also<00:02:44.510> Xbox<00:02:45.200> skin<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.500> gets<00:02:45.830> any

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
these games also Xbox skin it gets any

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.979 
these games also Xbox skin it gets any
type<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.190> DVR<00:02:46.700> functionality<00:02:46.880> with<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
type of DVR functionality with it in the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.840 
type of DVR functionality with it in the
new<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:48.920> also<00:02:49.130> make<00:02:49.430> sense<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.730> have

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
new one that also make sense to have

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.520 
new one that also make sense to have
this<00:02:50.030> as<00:02:50.209> well<00:02:50.390> too<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:51.110> they're<00:02:51.230> also<00:02:51.380> going

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
this as well too but they're also going

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.630 
this as well too but they're also going
to<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.680> pushing<00:02:51.920> their<00:02:52.160> content<00:02:52.489> if<00:02:52.580> you

about my terabyte but we'll see with

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.069 
advantage of 4k now at 4k tvs are now i
can<00:03:37.310> see<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.549> something<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:37.940> they<00:03:38.120> have

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
can see it's something that they have

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.780 
can see it's something that they have
support<00:03:39.590> for<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:39.980> maybe<00:03:40.130> doesn't<00:03:40.459> work<00:03:40.609> right

heard some other specs where the connect

likely<00:04:02.959> SB<00:04:03.350> 3-pointers<00:04:03.829> well<00:04:04.100> too<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.489> going

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
likely SB 3-pointers well too it's going

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.949 
likely SB 3-pointers well too it's going
to<00:04:04.670> allow<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.850> push<00:04:05.180> more<00:04:05.390> data<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:05.930> that

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
to allow the push more data so that

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.440 
to allow the push more data so that
connect<00:04:06.709> canim<00:04:06.950> could<00:04:07.100> be<00:04:07.160> much

connect canim could be much

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.229 
connect canim could be much
accurate<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.319> little<00:04:09.069> very<00:04:09.160> very<00:04:09.459> very

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
accurate and a little very very very

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.240 
accurate and a little very very very
fast<00:04:10.450> response<00:04:10.930> time<00:04:11.050> so<00:04:11.500> i<00:04:11.530> can<00:04:11.680> see<00:04:11.980> that

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
fast response time so i can see that

sort<00:06:17.820> of<00:06:17.910> gone<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:18.480> at<00:06:18.990> that<00:06:19.110> point<00:06:19.410> I<00:06:19.560> think

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
sort of gone and at that point I think

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.230 
sort of gone and at that point I think
then<00:06:19.890> that's<00:06:20.070> when<00:06:20.310> worry<00:06:20.820> about<00:06:21.000> digital

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
then that's when worry about digital

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.670 
then that's when worry about digital
downloading<00:06:21.810> which<00:06:21.930> then<00:06:22.170> you're<00:06:22.530> not<00:06:22.590> really

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
downloading which then you're not really

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.590 
downloading which then you're not really
gonna<00:06:22.830> have<00:06:23.040> a<00:06:23.070> used<00:06:23.310> market<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:24.030> then<00:06:24.240> really

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
gonna have a used market and then really

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.580 
gonna have a used market and then really
you're<00:06:24.690> not<00:06:24.780> gonna<00:06:24.870> throw<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.110> about<00:06:25.260> piracy

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
you're not gonna throw a about piracy

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.900 
you're not gonna throw a about piracy
exec<00:06:25.890> bodies<00:06:26.130> just<00:06:26.220> pretty<00:06:26.430> much<00:06:26.580> downloading

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
exec bodies just pretty much downloading

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.750 
exec bodies just pretty much downloading

it straight from the straight from the

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.250 
source itself but then again there's
always<00:06:32.850> a<00:06:32.880> way<00:06:33.060> that<00:06:33.420> people<00:06:33.780> forgot<00:06:34.050> away<00:06:34.200> to

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
always a way that people forgot away to

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.710 
always a way that people forgot away to
pirate<00:06:34.650> everything<00:06:35.070> so<00:06:35.400> it<00:06:36.090> won't<00:06:36.390> be<00:06:36.510> fully

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
pirate everything so it won't be fully

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.270 
pirate everything so it won't be fully
solid<00:06:37.080> but<00:06:37.230> least<00:06:37.380> would<00:06:37.500> be<00:06:37.590> a<00:06:37.620> lot<00:06:38.040> lower

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
solid but least would be a lot lower

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.520 
solid but least would be a lot lower
than<00:06:38.430> what<00:06:38.670> it<00:06:38.790> is<00:06:38.910> but<00:06:39.240> I<00:06:39.450> don't<00:06:40.170> see<00:06:40.500> that

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
than what it is but I don't see that

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.490 
than what it is but I don't see that
necessarily<00:06:41.630> happening<00:06:42.630> without<00:06:42.780> really

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
necessarily happening without really

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.700 
necessarily happening without really
really<00:06:43.830> a<00:06:43.880> bad<00:06:44.880> revolt<00:06:45.330> from<00:06:45.510> gamers<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.410> fans

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
really a bad revolt from gamers and fans

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.850 
really a bad revolt from gamers and fans
but<00:06:47.250> we'll<00:06:47.880> see<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.210> way<00:06:48.870> that<00:06:48.900> goes<00:06:49.350> but

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
but we'll see the way that goes but

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.350 
but we'll see the way that goes but
right<00:06:50.040> now<00:06:50.220> that's<00:06:50.400> one<00:06:50.610> of<00:06:50.700> my<00:06:50.790> thoughts<00:06:51.120> on
