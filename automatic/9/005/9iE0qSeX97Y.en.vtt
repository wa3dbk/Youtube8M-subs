00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
now and basically what it does is it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.860 
now and basically what it does is it
makes<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.150> letters<00:02:29.420> look<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.630> little

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
makes the letters look a little

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.280 
makes the letters look a little
three-dimensional<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:32.630> gonna<00:02:32.780> be<00:02:32.990> read

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
three-dimensional and it's gonna be read

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.610 
three-dimensional and it's gonna be read
letters<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.250> white<00:02:34.610> background<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:39.590> a

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
letters on a white background and like a

letters on a white background and like a
gray<00:02:40.040> drop<00:02:40.430> shadow<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.990> what<00:02:45.170> this

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
gray drop shadow and this is what this

00:02:45.350 --> 00:03:04.809 
gray drop shadow and this is what this
is

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:17.050 

a<00:03:14.439> lot<00:03:15.439> of<00:03:15.469> people<00:03:15.769> put<00:03:15.980> their<00:03:16.189> shadows<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:17.030> the

you

so<00:04:36.979> that's<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.280> pattern<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.729> laid<00:04:37.970> out<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
so that's the pattern I laid out the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.689 
so that's the pattern I laid out the
bottom<00:04:41.419> line<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:42.080> not<00:04:42.500> centered<00:04:43.100> because

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
bottom line is not centered because

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.610 
bottom line is not centered because
since<00:04:44.120> I'm<00:04:44.270> making<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.630> pattern<00:04:44.840> I'll<00:04:45.199> be<00:04:45.380> able

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
since I'm making a pattern I'll be able

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.520 
since I'm making a pattern I'll be able
to<00:04:45.770> move<00:04:46.039> it<00:04:46.340> exactly<00:04:46.880> where<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.030> want<00:04:47.360> on<00:04:47.599> the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
to move it exactly where I want on the

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.529 
to move it exactly where I want on the
sign<00:04:49.660> now<00:04:50.660> what<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:50.960> do<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:52.460> bounce<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
sign now what I do is I bounce the

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.020 
sign now what I do is I bounce the
pattern<00:04:53.960> which<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.740> basically<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.610> pounce

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
pattern which is basically a pounce

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.650 
pattern which is basically a pounce
wheel<00:04:56.419> that<00:04:57.259> has<00:04:57.319> a<00:04:58.039> little<00:04:58.729> wheel<00:04:59.000> on<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.479> end

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
wheel that has a little wheel on the end

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.279 
wheel that has a little wheel on the end
with<00:04:59.930> spikes<00:05:00.289> on<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.130> what<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.340> do<00:05:01.460> is<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.479> go

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
with spikes on it and what I do is I go

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.249 
with spikes on it and what I do is I go
over<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.770> letters<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.840> leaves<00:05:09.050> me<00:05:09.199> a

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
over the letters and it leaves me a

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.360 
over the letters and it leaves me a
perforated<00:05:10.099> dot<00:05:10.430> pattern<00:05:11.030> right<00:05:11.300> here<00:05:11.330> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
perforated dot pattern right here and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.040 
perforated dot pattern right here and
once<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.490> bounce<00:05:13.759> this<00:05:13.910> I'll<00:05:14.210> show<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.449> how<00:05:14.720> I

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
once I bounce this I'll show you how I

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.490 
once I bounce this I'll show you how I
put<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:15.440> on<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.710> board<00:05:16.009> and<00:05:17.080> put<00:05:18.080> charcoal

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
put it on the board and put charcoal

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.499 
put it on the board and put charcoal
over<00:05:18.830> it<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:19.099> it'll<00:05:19.340> give<00:05:19.520> me<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.759> nice<00:05:20.120> pattern

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
over it and it'll give me a nice pattern

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.800 
over it and it'll give me a nice pattern
to<00:05:20.660> go<00:05:20.810> from

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.430 

and<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.140> really<00:05:29.380> easy

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.520 

a<00:05:37.550> lot<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.580> people<00:05:39.000> lay<00:05:39.270> out<00:05:39.480> directly<00:05:40.080> right

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
a lot of people lay out directly right

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.860 
a lot of people lay out directly right
on<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.800> board<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.880> that's<00:05:42.300> what<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.540> usually

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
on the board and that's what I usually

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.280 
on the board and that's what I usually
do<00:05:43.380> but<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.010> was<00:05:44.250> kind<00:05:44.550> of<00:05:44.960> unfamiliar<00:05:45.960> with

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
do but I was kind of unfamiliar with

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.650 
do but I was kind of unfamiliar with
this<00:05:46.500> letter<00:05:46.800> style<00:05:47.160> so<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:47.910> wanted<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.270> draw<00:05:48.540> it

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
this letter style so I wanted to draw it

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.510 
this letter style so I wanted to draw it
out<00:05:48.780> on<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.050> piece<00:05:49.260> of<00:05:49.470> paper<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:50.130> get<00:05:50.280> it<00:05:50.370> nice

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
out on a piece of paper to get it nice

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.850 
out on a piece of paper to get it nice
and<00:05:50.550> perfect<00:05:51.210> before<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.080> actually<00:05:52.320> started

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
and perfect before I actually started

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:02.250 
and perfect before I actually started
drawing<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.280> on<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.580> board

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.650 

you

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.600 

there's<00:06:06.660> also<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.199> tool<00:06:07.530> called<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.009> it's<00:06:08.400> like

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
there's also a tool called the it's like

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.670 
there's also a tool called the it's like
an<00:06:08.729> electric<00:06:09.240> pounce<00:06:09.509> machine<00:06:09.990> it's

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
an electric pounce machine it's

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.339 
an electric pounce machine it's
basically<00:06:11.310> like<00:06:12.030> a<00:06:12.270> pen<00:06:14.690> with<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.840> tip<00:06:16.110> and

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
basically like a pen with the tip and

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.730 
basically like a pen with the tip and
you<00:06:16.409> put<00:06:17.039> the<00:06:17.159> pattern<00:06:17.430> over<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.360> metal<00:06:19.139> surface

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
you put the pattern over a metal surface

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.270 
you put the pattern over a metal surface
and<00:06:19.949> you<00:06:20.250> draw<00:06:20.610> with<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.479> metal<00:06:21.990> pen<00:06:22.259> and<00:06:22.560> it

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
and you draw with the metal pen and it

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.159 
and you draw with the metal pen and it
kind<00:06:23.520> of<00:06:23.580> gives<00:06:23.789> sparks<00:06:24.360> and<00:06:24.539> gives<00:06:24.720> you<00:06:24.870> a<00:06:24.900> dot

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
kind of gives sparks and gives you a dot

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.710 
kind of gives sparks and gives you a dot
pattern<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:26.129> you<00:06:26.280> can<00:06:26.400> go<00:06:26.550> from<00:06:26.759> but<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.030> still

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
pattern that you can go from but I still

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.100 
pattern that you can go from but I still
do<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:27.870> by<00:06:28.050> hand<00:06:29.360> that's<00:06:30.360> pretty<00:06:30.720> much<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.080> way

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
do it by hand that's pretty much the way

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.710 
do it by hand that's pretty much the way
I<00:06:31.169> do<00:06:31.289> everything<00:06:31.740> is<00:06:32.099> is<00:06:32.400> old-school<00:06:32.909> by<00:06:33.419> hand

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
I do everything is is old-school by hand

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.249 
I do everything is is old-school by hand
and<00:06:34.580> once<00:06:35.580> I<00:06:36.030> finish<00:06:36.930> pouncing<00:06:37.919> this<00:06:38.069> pattern

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
and once I finish pouncing this pattern

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.689 
and once I finish pouncing this pattern
I'm<00:06:40.259> gonna<00:06:40.530> put<00:06:40.710> it<00:06:40.800> on<00:06:40.889> the<00:06:41.009> board<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:41.520> I'm

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
I'm gonna put it on the board and I'm

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.210 
I'm gonna put it on the board and I'm
going<00:06:41.729> to<00:06:41.880> letter<00:06:42.060> it
