turning it with water as we all know
compost<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:19.010> then<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.790> all<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.060> those

surface speed won't go look in the
bottom<00:02:35.330> ok<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.620> now<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.860> can<00:02:37.070> put<00:02:37.100> 10%<00:02:37.940> by

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
bottom ok so now you can put 10% by

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.090 
bottom ok so now you can put 10% by
weight<00:02:38.120> per<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.200> now<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.410> got<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> circular

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.410 
produced from dropping all that stuff
and<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:40.720> tanks<00:03:41.260> I'm<00:03:41.530> pumping<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.670> to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
and that tanks I'm pumping out and to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.490 
and that tanks I'm pumping out and to
aquaponics<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.500> now<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:45.940> raise

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
aquaponics and now I can raise

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.330 
aquaponics and now I can raise
vegetables<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.740> fruits<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.280> strawberries

usually<00:03:50.470> grow<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:51.070> Haiti<00:03:51.310> because<00:03:52.030> I've<00:03:52.270> got<00:03:52.450> a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
usually grow in Haiti because I've got a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.570 
usually grow in Haiti because I've got a
shade<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.840> system<00:03:53.500> up<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.860> I'm<00:03:54.100> throwing<00:03:54.310> my

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
shade that system up and I'm throwing my

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.630 
shade that system up and I'm throwing my
Moringa<00:03:55.180> which<00:03:55.390> gives<00:03:55.660> me<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> 50%<00:03:56.590> shade<00:03:56.860> so

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
Moringa which gives me a 50% shade so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.330
