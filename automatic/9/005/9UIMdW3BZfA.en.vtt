well<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:17.450> kind<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.810> missed<00:01:18.020> them<00:01:18.290> they<00:01:18.740> first

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010

appeared<00:01:19.370> in<00:01:19.460> ashes<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.060> ashes<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.440> thought

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
appeared in ashes to ashes and I thought

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.890 
appeared in ashes to ashes and I thought
they<00:01:21.800> would<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.130> be<00:01:22.250> incidental<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.870> the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
they would just be incidental to the

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.250 
they would just be incidental to the
story<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.710> created<00:01:25.280> them<00:01:25.960> literally<00:01:26.960> on

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
story and that created them literally on

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.040 
story and that created them literally on
the<00:01:27.590> fly<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.460> was<00:01:28.610> writing<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:29.180> scenes<00:01:29.750> that

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
the fly as I was writing a scenes that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.590 
the fly as I was writing a scenes that
they<00:01:30.229> were<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.620> and<00:01:30.920> they<00:01:31.880> became<00:01:32.210> more<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
they were in and they became more and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.770 
they were in and they became more and
more<00:01:32.630> important<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.530> me<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.550> then<00:01:34.760> I<00:01:35.090> wanted<00:01:35.630> to

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
more important to me so then I wanted to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.600 
more important to me so then I wanted to
do<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:35.960> book<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:36.470> those<00:01:36.770> two<00:01:36.979> characters<00:01:37.190> as

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
do a book with those two characters as

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.399 
do a book with those two characters as
the<00:01:37.760> main<00:01:37.940> focus<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:38.810> came<00:01:39.020> dust<00:01:39.260> to

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
the main focus and then came dust to

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.399 
the main focus and then came dust to
dust<00:01:39.700> Sam<00:01:40.700> Kovac<00:01:41.180> it's<00:01:41.450> kind<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.840> not<00:01:42.260> the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
dust Sam Kovac it's kind of not the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.710 
dust Sam Kovac it's kind of not the
happiest<00:01:42.890> ending<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.610> dusted<00:01:44.180> us<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.540> just

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
happiest ending and dusted us and I just

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.219 
happiest ending and dusted us and I just
really<00:01:44.990> felt<00:01:45.170> badly<00:01:46.330> with<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.479> opening<00:01:47.900> scene

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
really felt badly with the opening scene

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.780 
really felt badly with the opening scene
you<00:01:48.500> break<00:01:48.710> down<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.979> illusion<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.460> one's

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
you break down the illusion that one's

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.330 
you break down the illusion that one's
home<00:01:50.180> is<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.540> safe<00:01:50.900> haven<00:01:51.200> from<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.680> evils<00:01:52.220> of

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
home is a safe haven from the evils of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.580 
home is a safe haven from the evils of
the<00:01:52.460> outside<00:01:52.729> world<00:01:52.930> why<00:01:53.930> do<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.170> choose<00:01:54.530> to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
the outside world why do you choose to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.560 
the outside world why do you choose to
break<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.130> barrier<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.000> know<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:56.210> may<00:01:56.360> take

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
break the barrier you know we may take

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.719 
break the barrier you know we may take
many<00:01:56.750> many<00:01:57.200> different<00:01:57.440> kinds<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:58.040> measures<00:01:58.400> to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
many many different kinds of measures to

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.820 
many many different kinds of measures to
make<00:01:59.119> ourselves<00:01:59.270> feel<00:01:59.570> more<00:02:00.020> secure<00:02:00.260> and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
make ourselves feel more secure and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.800 
make ourselves feel more secure and
therefore<00:02:01.490> when<00:02:01.670> we're<00:02:01.850> in<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.270> secure

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
therefore when we're in that secure

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.109 
therefore when we're in that secure
situation<00:02:03.530> we<00:02:03.740> drop<00:02:04.010> away<00:02:04.190> our<00:02:04.490> own<00:02:04.700> guard

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
situation we drop away our own guard

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.690 
situation we drop away our own guard
yeah<00:02:05.780> we've<00:02:06.080> become<00:02:06.380> really<00:02:06.680> very<00:02:07.250> extremely

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
yeah we've become really very extremely

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.059 
yeah we've become really very extremely
vulnerable<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:08.720> we've<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.200> that's<00:02:09.679> okay

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
vulnerable but we've that that's okay

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.070 
vulnerable but we've that that's okay
because<00:02:10.369> we're<00:02:10.729> safe<00:02:11.000> there<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.689> really

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
because we're safe there and really

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.289 
because we're safe there and really
security<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.739> very<00:02:12.860> much<00:02:13.220> an<00:02:13.430> illusion<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.180> I

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
security is very much an illusion and I

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.550 
security is very much an illusion and I
think<00:02:14.510> that's<00:02:14.659> something<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.989> resonates

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
think that's something that resonates

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.350 
think that's something that resonates
