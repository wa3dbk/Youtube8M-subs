00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello how are you all welcome once 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.450
 more to the channel I am taker and good today 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.420
 I bring you a pretty story 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.420
 interesting about the weirdest letter of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.270
 July- and good because I like with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.730
 this data well then you will know that 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.290
 in the past few days there were a few months of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.240
 jury that were circulating by 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.640
 internet which were quite 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.400
 funny but then I got the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.770
 primary nostalgia of seeing the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.180
 children when I from the little groups of two and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
 everyone else standing watching the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 guys there I hurt, or I do not know how 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.560
 say when it was rain but yes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 I do not know those who have my age more or less 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.160
 they talk about what I'm talking about the most 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.670
 guys, not unfortunately not 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.620
 touched the golden age and pro June as well 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.480
 that's good investigating a bit about the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 yogi pull out my letters I can 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.010
 investigate and I found the data of the letter 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.590
 rarest of rain 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 whose name is tyler the great warrior or 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.930
 in English tyler wright warriors and good 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.190
 because this letter is so powerful because 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 not because they are chingona or because they are 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.630
 rare because there is only one in the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 world is not the strongest card is not the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.570
 more pro but there is only one in the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 world and also the data because the cherry 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.360
 the cake created a 14 years 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.390
 that time in October 2002 called 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 tyler tyler a child who suffered enough 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.930
 had to undergo surgeries had to suffer 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 quite seriously because they detected him 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.320
 an illness to this boy then then 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 they had to remove 25% of their liver and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 66 centimeters of the large intestine bone 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.070
 imagine everything that has to happen 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.710
 a 14 year old child to suffer that be 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 a great warrior as his letter says and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.250
 well a foundation knew about this 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 story and this boy loved blond him 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.050
 they liked rain enough the foundation 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.570
 make-a-wish 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.480
 contact with the rain or because 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.550
 if all that band that makes rain and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.650
 as they agreed to do 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.780
 a letter for the child or the child the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.270
 designed tell you take it there goes this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.250
 paper that draws in this drawer 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.130
 your little card and we are going to make it 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.660
 for a letter of mourning a real letter and 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.150
 said and done the boy began to draw 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.510
 and this great trailer came out 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.490
 warrior as we can appreciate then 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.110
 It looks a lot like dragon ball 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.250
 of this boy also liked dragon 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.590
 ball and he began to copy trump see the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.510
 letter the strong of the future there has its 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.330
 sword is even making a cameo to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.980
 mega and is in its prey there and then 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.260
 it was what kids liked us dragon 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.930
 ball I combined it and made this letter 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.630
 well with a pretty design but it's 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.770
 very program and I really liked it 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.260
 and it may be the weirdest card 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.640
 currently he has tyler obviously and 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.200
 I do not think I 'm going to sell it because it's 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.350
 a great memory and I do not think that 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.790
 I can not even use it because it's one I do not know 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.519
 it's something that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.319
 that you get even you can see from 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.540
 background in the arts tournament 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.519
 martial in the good card there you will see it 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.590
 on the screen but it is a curious fact that 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.319
 It does not help at all, but for 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.150
 feed our our level of gif 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.790
 of geeks and all that but it is a 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.280
 data that can serve them maybe some 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.170
 day and if not then to entertain a 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.180
 time and at least you know what the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.879
 more rain rare card already know 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.129
 tyler the great warrior tyler owner 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.409
 grizzly this guy who then currently 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:46.579
 I do not know what advice I have and at that time 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.919
 I was 14 and well now I think it's the 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.049
 richest child in the world in terms of 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.120
 rain letters are spoken ok so 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.530

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.560
 success of his like and see you in another 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.629
 curious fact of life July not 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.439
 I know of the videogames of all good and 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.750
