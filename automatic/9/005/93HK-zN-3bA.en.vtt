00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.520
 let's see this mesh 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.670
 it is very easy it is very beautiful for the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.130
 Summer is beautiful for winter 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.340
 in a thick wool very warm for 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.700
 a shawl has a characteristic 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.129
 very important and is that it comes out on tip 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.620
 so if you do not scarf 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.230
 They need to do the border or nothing because 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.410
 the same tip the same half stitch 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.160
 will give us the adornment that is to leave in 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.570
 the same point for a shawl always this 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.280
 it comes out in tip and it looks very nice 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.850
 it's aimed we're going to make the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.030
 next way here I have mounted or 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.940
 the evil given 18 points with which 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.320
 I made the sample those eighteen points 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.860
 they are always multiples of two to those 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.160
 multiples of two must always add the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.090
 first and last as edge points 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.530
 that are made by the right at a point 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.799
 straight 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.360
 the last point in a right and by the 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.400
 reverse the whole race in a backhand 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.460
 is targeted is so easy and is so 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.950
 fast does not have but two races we're going 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.820
 to see her step by step the wool that I 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.340
 I used is a very soft number 4 wool 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.299
 the needles we're going to make 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.659
 This sample is 7 American 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.020
 equivalent to 4.5 millimeters 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.039
 we started career number 1 for the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.479
 tissue right we started like I did them 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:02.170
 I always say I just rode the 18 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.940
 points and I start the race number 1 of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.460
 this race number 1 is made of the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.880
 next way the edge point 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.410
 always goes on a right by law 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.200
 of the fabric and then I make a loop of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.700
 left to right 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.709
 two points together at a right point and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.970
 those two points are made by the part of 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.300
 behind the tissue 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.830
 that's all we repeat a loop 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.300
 two points together 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.720
 in a right 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.830
 the hoe 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.880
 two points together at a right point 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.730
 a lasso two stitches together at one point 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.820
 right the thrown from left to 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.790
 right we introduce the needle through 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.720
 points we take out a needle on the side 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.660
 from behind we assemble the strand we take out 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.000
 the tip of the needle thread and a point 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:10.190
 let's drop our two points a loop 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 two stitches together lasso 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.780
 two stitches together lasso 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.030
 two points together we come to the end see 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 we have three points left that are both 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.160
 points together and the last point of edge 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.319
 always at a right point of all 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.870
 we finish the race number one we are going to 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.280
 carla number two that is made of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.340
 beginning to end all in a backhand 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.360
 making our mesh that cutest 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.420
 faster easier to make this mesh 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.459
 It is not reversible but like you 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.069
 they can be I'm doing it all in 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.330
 reverse point everything is done in reverse point 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.280
 from beginning to end 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.860
 on the wrong side the tide looks 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.010
 spectacular because it looks like a few 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.620
 thick squares that give more body 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.410
 the stitch to the garment that we go to 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.930
 dyeing and that makes her look very pretty 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.080
 from beginning to end including 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:19.080
 edge points on the reverse side of the fabric 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 it's all done in a backhand 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.650
 so we finish our work 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.650
 this design 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.670
 very nice very special because it brings us 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.240
 and the way 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.240
 in tip if they have any doubt go to 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.070
 my page how to knit dotcom of all 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.840
 ways to already find the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.480
 written instructions of all the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.800
 counted that I am teaching them 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.590
 visit this page 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.690
 when they have finished doing 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.530
 the two races that I just had 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.380
 teach continue on 1 and 2 and repeat 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.810
 one after another to achieve the length of 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.210
 the stitch you want to do likewise 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:11.550
 to the width they always have to have in 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.550
 account to mount points multiples of 2
