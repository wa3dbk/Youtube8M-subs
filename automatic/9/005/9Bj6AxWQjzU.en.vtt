builds<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.359> something<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.960> galaxy

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
builds is for something like the galaxy

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
variants of the device they're working

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.099 
variants of the device they're working
to<00:00:26.310> pare<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> down<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.000> only<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:27.960> two

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to pare it down to only have one or two

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.630 
to pare it down to only have one or two
different<00:00:28.260> builds<00:00:28.800> specifically<00:00:29.429> they've

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
different builds specifically they've

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
different builds specifically they've
got<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.029> build<00:00:30.269> now<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> GSM

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
got one build now for all of the GSM

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
got one build now for all of the GSM
variants<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.579> presumably<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.630> would

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
variants and then presumably they would

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.510 
variants and then presumably they would
have<00:00:33.840> another<00:00:34.020> bill<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> CDMA<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.280> like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have another bill for the CDMA one like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.620 
have another bill for the CDMA one like
I<00:00:35.610> said<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.120> talked<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.450> this

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
I said I think we talked about this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
I said I think we talked about this
before<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> little<00:00:38.219> while<00:00:38.340> back

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
before because just a little while back

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
before because just a little while back
they<00:00:38.910> did<00:00:39.090> release<00:00:39.239> unified<00:00:39.870> builds<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
they did release unified builds for the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
they did release unified builds for the
HTC<00:00:40.829> One<00:00:41.250> devices<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> additionally<00:00:42.570> with

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
HTC One devices and additionally with

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.760 
HTC One devices and additionally with
this<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.989> came<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.320> mentioned<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this they came out and mentioned that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.049 
this they came out and mentioned that
they're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.280> doing<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> same<00:00:44.579> sort

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
they're going to be doing the same sort

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819 
they're going to be doing the same sort
of<00:00:45.090> unified<00:00:45.480> builds<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:45.989> other<00:00:46.140> devices<00:00:46.350> like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
of unified builds for other devices like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850 
of unified builds for other devices like
the<00:00:47.039> Moto<00:00:47.160> X<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> Moto<00:00:47.940> G<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.899> droid<00:00:49.260> mini

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the Moto X in the Moto G the droid mini

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.010 
the Moto X in the Moto G the droid mini
max<00:00:50.250> ultra<00:00:50.850> whatever<00:00:51.270> else<00:00:51.449> comes<00:00:51.539> along<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
max ultra whatever else comes along that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
max ultra whatever else comes along that
starts<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> word<00:00:52.770> droid<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.520> very

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
starts with the word droid so it's very

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
starts with the word droid so it's very
nice<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.600> sort<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.870> do

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
nice to see that they can sort of do

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.510 
nice to see that they can sort of do
this<00:00:55.320> where<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.649> pair<00:00:55.920> everything<00:00:56.309> back

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this where they pair everything back

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
this where they pair everything back
make<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.239> bit<00:00:57.449> simpler<00:00:57.930> even<00:00:58.559> though

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
make it a little bit simpler even though

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
make it a little bit simpler even though
I<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.210> could

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
I know very little about this it could

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
I know very little about this it could
be<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.719> complicated<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.440> their<00:01:01.590> side<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
be more complicated on their side but it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
be more complicated on their side but it
seemed<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.640> fewer<00:01:03.120> things<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.750> code<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
seemed like fewer things of code to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
seemed like fewer things of code to
maintain<00:01:04.650> makes<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.580> simpler<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.180> everybody

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
maintain makes it simpler on everybody

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
maintain makes it simpler on everybody
in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> long<00:01:06.990> run<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.650> may<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
in the long run there may have to be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
in the long run there may have to be
some<00:01:08.310> special<00:01:08.460> tweaks<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.479> done<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
some special tweaks and things done to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
some special tweaks and things done to
this<00:01:10.110> individual<00:01:10.590> images<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> make<00:01:11.400> them<00:01:11.670> work

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this individual images to make them work

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.210 
this individual images to make them work
sort<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> cross<00:01:12.960> device<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.070> like

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
sort of cross device like that but like

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.350 
sort of cross device like that but like
I<00:01:14.340> said<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.490> would<00:01:14.670> presume<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.119> would<00:01:15.210> make<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I said I would presume it would make it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.550 
I said I would presume it would make it
a<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:15.659> bit<00:01:15.840> simpler<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> long<00:01:16.530> run

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a little bit simpler in the long run

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.050 
a little bit simpler in the long run
because<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.189> fewer<00:01:17.400> things<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> keep<00:01:17.909> an

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
because you have fewer things to keep an

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.149 
because you have fewer things to keep an
eye<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.810> sets<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> eyes<00:01:19.290> looking<00:01:19.619> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
eye on and more sets of eyes looking in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
eye on and more sets of eyes looking in
a<00:01:20.220> smaller<00:01:20.460> area<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
a smaller area so if you have one of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
a smaller area so if you have one of
those<00:01:21.840> Samsung<00:01:22.350> devices<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> mentioned

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
those Samsung devices that I mentioned

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
surrounding so in theory can actually

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.650 
surrounding so in theory can actually
map<00:05:53.220> out<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.669> room<00:05:53.910> it<00:05:54.150> can<00:05:54.240> map<00:05:54.449> out<00:05:54.599> your

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
map out a room it can map out your

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.110 
map out a room it can map out your
location<00:05:55.169> based<00:05:55.949> upon<00:05:56.340> moving<00:05:56.580> around<00:05:56.910> the

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
room and looking around the room using

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.870 
room and looking around the room using
the<00:05:58.680> cameras<00:05:59.070> and<00:05:59.280> it<00:05:59.400> actually<00:05:59.520> sort<00:05:59.820> of

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
the cameras and it actually sort of

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.490 
the cameras and it actually sort of
brings<00:06:00.060> up<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.270> whole<00:06:00.389> idea<00:06:00.750> of<00:06:00.810> what<00:06:01.289> could

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
brings up the whole idea of what could

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.050 
brings up the whole idea of what could
you<00:06:01.620> do<00:06:01.770> with<00:06:01.800> technology<00:06:02.099> like<00:06:02.699> that<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.030> I

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
you do with technology like that and I

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.150 
you do with technology like that and I
think<00:06:03.270> that's<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.990> entire<00:06:04.260> reason<00:06:04.320> for<00:06:05.070> it

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
think that's the entire reason for it

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.370 
think that's the entire reason for it
existing<00:06:05.699> is<00:06:05.849> you<00:06:06.240> know<00:06:06.330> what<00:06:06.630> can<00:06:06.960> developers

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
existing is you know what can developers

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.560 
existing is you know what can developers
come<00:06:07.560> up<00:06:07.740> with<00:06:07.979> in<00:06:08.190> terms<00:06:08.669> of<00:06:08.880> this<00:06:09.030> technology

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
come up with in terms of this technology

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.210 
come up with in terms of this technology
can<00:06:09.690> you<00:06:09.810> make<00:06:09.960> new<00:06:10.139> games<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.680> take<00:06:10.830> advantage

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
can you make new games to take advantage

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.430 
can you make new games to take advantage
of<00:06:11.340> it<00:06:11.430> can<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:11.699> make<00:06:11.849> new<00:06:12.030> gps<00:06:12.900> apps<00:06:13.169> that

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
of it can you make new gps apps that

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.990 
of it can you make new gps apps that
will<00:06:13.500> take<00:06:13.650> advantage<00:06:14.039> of<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.250> camera<00:06:14.610> as<00:06:14.789> the

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
will take advantage of the camera as the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.150 
will take advantage of the camera as the
same<00:06:15.210> time<00:06:15.360> using<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.870> GPS<00:06:16.349> can<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:16.889> use<00:06:16.949> it

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
same time using the GPS can you use it

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.589 
same time using the GPS can you use it
for<00:06:17.190> better<00:06:17.400> mapping<00:06:17.669> data<00:06:18.000> can<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.300> use<00:06:18.449> it

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
for better mapping data can you use it

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.960 
for better mapping data can you use it
for<00:06:18.630> things<00:06:18.930> like<00:06:19.169> Google<00:06:19.830> Street<00:06:20.340> View<00:06:20.639> but

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
for things like Google Street View but

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.939 
for things like Google Street View but
have<00:06:21.389> it<00:06:21.419> comes<00:06:21.930> straight<00:06:22.289> from<00:06:22.320> one<00:06:22.740> device

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
have it comes straight from one device

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.200 
have it comes straight from one device
where<00:06:23.340> you<00:06:23.370> just<00:06:23.520> sort<00:06:23.669> of<00:06:23.729> hold<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:23.970> up<00:06:24.060> and

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
where you just sort of hold it up and

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.760 
where you just sort of hold it up and
move<00:06:24.300> it<00:06:24.419> around<00:06:24.510> and<00:06:24.870> it<00:06:24.930> maps<00:06:25.139> out<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.380> the

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
move it around and it maps out the the

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.589 
move it around and it maps out the the
interiors<00:06:26.280> of<00:06:26.310> locations<00:06:27.030> I<00:06:27.210> know<00:06:27.300> there<00:06:27.539> was

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
interiors of locations I know there was

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.029 
interiors of locations I know there was
a<00:06:27.750> project<00:06:27.990> at<00:06:28.260> one<00:06:28.349> point<00:06:28.530> for<00:06:28.770> Google's

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
a project at one point for Google's

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.350 
a project at one point for Google's
start<00:06:29.280> mapping<00:06:29.460> out<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:29.760> interiors<00:06:30.300> of

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
start mapping out the interiors of

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.129 
start mapping out the interiors of
building

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
building

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.839 
building
things<00:06:31.409> like<00:06:31.590> moles<00:06:31.889> and<00:06:32.249> all<00:06:32.460> sorts<00:06:32.819> of

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
things like moles and all sorts of

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.700 
things like moles and all sorts of
public<00:06:33.180> landmarks<00:06:33.719> things<00:06:33.960> like<00:06:34.139> that<00:06:34.319> so

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
public landmarks things like that so

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.929 
public landmarks things like that so
it's<00:06:34.830> very<00:06:34.979> interesting<00:06:35.340> to<00:06:35.430> see<00:06:35.580> them<00:06:35.759> coming

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.939 
it's very interesting to see them coming

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.219 
it's very interesting to see them coming
out<00:06:36.120> with<00:06:36.240> a<00:06:36.270> device<00:06:36.509> like<00:06:36.539> this<00:06:36.870> even<00:06:37.110> though

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
out with a device like this even though

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.929 
out with a device like this even though
like<00:06:37.409> I<00:06:37.530> said<00:06:37.710> it<00:06:37.800> may<00:06:37.979> never<00:06:38.219> hit<00:06:38.490> the<00:06:38.520> market

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
like I said it may never hit the market

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.519 
like I said it may never hit the market
and<00:06:39.090> according<00:06:39.509> to<00:06:39.539> the<00:06:39.689> story<00:06:39.960> starting<00:06:40.469> in

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
and according to the story starting in

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.200 
and according to the story starting in
the<00:06:40.560> middle<00:06:40.770> of<00:06:40.800> next<00:06:40.979> month<00:06:41.129> this<00:06:41.669> Google

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
the middle of next month this Google

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.909 
the middle of next month this Google
advanced<00:06:42.689> project<00:06:43.080> team<00:06:43.289> is<00:06:43.439> supposed<00:06:43.590> to

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
advanced project team is supposed to

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.429 
advanced project team is supposed to
seed<00:06:44.129> about<00:06:44.490> 200<00:06:44.999> devices<00:06:45.449> out<00:06:45.599> to<00:06:45.810> developers

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
seed about 200 devices out to developers

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.010 
seed about 200 devices out to developers
so<00:06:46.710> being<00:06:47.610> that<00:06:47.699> this<00:06:47.969> is<00:06:48.029> an<00:06:48.270> XDA<00:06:48.539> Developers

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
so being that this is an XDA Developers

sure there will be stories about it if

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.369 
sure there will be stories about it if
it<00:06:56.310> does<00:06:56.520> come<00:06:56.789> and<00:06:57.240> go<00:06:57.419> if<00:06:57.840> there's<00:06:58.080> any<00:06:58.199> way
