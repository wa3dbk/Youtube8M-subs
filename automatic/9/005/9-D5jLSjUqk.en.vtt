00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.849
 this week's retro video we have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 this cathode ray television crt 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.689
 a television that surely many 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 we had in our brand houses 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.800
 goldstar a brand that was founded in 1958 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.250
 and in 1995 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.769
 merges and becomes what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.989
 now we know how the gym wants 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.949
 say the hylas is not the ex-voice 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 I hope you like it just like that 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.640
 started this company and it's a television 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.289
 that we are going to show that of the 60 of the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.039
 60s that of course I did not have 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 remote control we can not see how it 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.850
 they changed the channels you had to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.769
 lift off the sofa from the bed to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 change the channel and it was a laziness 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.019
 tremendous to do that then we had 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.759
 all the channels here where was the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.119
 brand here they were learning we are going to 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.119
 learn it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.420
 the little ants are there and this is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.710
 volume this potentiometer will serve as 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 volume and also as turned on and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.160
 off on this side we had the car 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.010

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.650
 we pressed this capital and good this 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.990
 side the the wall horn of course and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.550
 we have brightness against this color all 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.660
 these parameters to move it a little bit to 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.320
 which to make it look better 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:46.140
 image was very heavy I had obviously 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.479
 a coaxial or good cable antenna 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.160
 because we can put antenna 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:59.280
