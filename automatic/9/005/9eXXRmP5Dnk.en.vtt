00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.310
 do it now 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.830
 hello I'm Sjoerd Huisman from to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.089
 roadside assistance 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 we all know it closer 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.619
 wipes out front doors that are stuck or a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 Finally on that flour will open in this video 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.439
 would like to show you how that can occur 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.739
 to become 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.020
 look to it to prevent the lock 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.149
 fixed goes fries it is handy to take a moment 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.649
 treat with the fluid asset 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.050
 thinking of a little bit 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.820
 oil that you spray into the lock 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.820
 we also do not forget the inside of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 the door to catch the lock 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 prevent the doors from closing friese 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 you can treat the rubber thereby 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.170
 are different types of resources 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.720
 available I have a nice one here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 roll then you can easily apply 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.680
 on the rubber 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.970
 with this you make a fat and with that is 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 that protects you from it 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.200
 that actually freeze now that we are 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.489
 to be busy 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.010
 also fill a little windscreen washer 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 antifreeze with or not the summer variant 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.399
 because it is not protected against freezing 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.500
 but the winter variants that is 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.389
 actually always blue 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.609
 make sure before freezing 

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:12.749
 it is now full of window defroster and 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.729
 final yolk 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:16.049
 and do not keep it in the car but here 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.859
 for another place where the easy 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.359
 at can 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.859
 so get overwhelmed by the cold 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.700
 nice to have some warms in the back 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.069
 lie 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.759
 nice sweater or blanket that would 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.759
 be able to lay in the back 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.939
 we recommend starting before the winter 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.670
 here the liquid let it down 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.409
 check and of course also the battery 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.569
 by having it measured and for that battery 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.799
 chek you can also call the roadside assistance at 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.749
 at a time of winter it is handy one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.100
 number of operations 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.319
 put the car in first gear 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.600
 and let the hand and the off to prevent 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.560
 that he was sad and also put the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 wipers off 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.640
 prevent the wiper blades from going 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.259
 freeze on the foreskin 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 is useful for example to cork 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.310
 use these under the 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.229
 to place wiper blades such that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.479
 this does not call it out and therefore not 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.789
 freeze 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.170
 set a number during the cold start 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.939
 Consider power consumers 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.130
 for example to the rear window heater 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.000
 this part namely the battery also it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.560
 drive from 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.630
 shorter pieces is not for a battery 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.940
 conducive so it is advisable off 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.500
 and to drive a bit longer if it 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.000
 the car is not handy 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.430
 or by, for example, a 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.709
 car wash fetching water that is left behind 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 you can of course freeze and ensure that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.730
 for example, a door no longer opens 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.590
 and now for a moment 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.430
 all the steps I have to take to winter 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 prevent problems 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.390
 No

 which you can do well and safely with these tips 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.099
 to keep on the road 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.470
 and should it ever go wrong then 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.860
 call for help or advice
