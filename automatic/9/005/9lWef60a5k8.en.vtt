these<00:00:16.580> are<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.760> most<00:00:16.939> commonly<00:00:17.390> used<00:00:17.740> reels

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
these are the most commonly used reels

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.920 
these are the most commonly used reels
and<00:00:19.070> they're<00:00:19.730> pretty<00:00:19.939> simple<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:20.599> actually

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
and they're pretty simple to actually

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.990 
and they're pretty simple to actually
use<00:00:21.170> but<00:00:21.349> there's<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:21.560> couple<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.920> tips<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:22.490> I

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
use but there's a couple of tips that I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.420 
use but there's a couple of tips that I
want<00:00:23.180> to<00:00:23.240> pass<00:00:23.450> on<00:00:23.750> that<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:24.560> see<00:00:24.860> most<00:00:25.070> people

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
want to pass on that I see most people

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.950 
want to pass on that I see most people
have<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.579> problem<00:00:25.790> with<00:00:26.000> now<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.390> first<00:00:26.660> thing

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
have a problem with now the first thing

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.550 
have a problem with now the first thing
that<00:00:27.560> we<00:00:27.650> do<00:00:27.829> is<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.009> distance<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:29.779> usually

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
that we do is the distance I usually

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.950 
that we do is the distance I usually
like<00:00:30.770> to<00:00:30.800> leave<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.340> about<00:00:31.430> foot<00:00:32.390> down<00:00:32.689> from

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
like to leave it about foot down from

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.270 
like to leave it about foot down from
the<00:00:33.079> end<00:00:33.200> of<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.320> rod<00:00:33.470> tip<00:00:33.770> that's<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.100> lure

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the end of the rod tip that's the lure

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.100 
the end of the rod tip that's the lure
and<00:00:35.060> that<00:00:35.239> just<00:00:35.390> gives<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.690> little<00:00:35.810> bit<00:00:36.079> of

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
and that just gives you a little bit of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.100 
and that just gives you a little bit of
room<00:00:36.380> to<00:00:36.440> move<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:37.190> gives<00:00:37.520> you<00:00:37.670> enough<00:00:38.120> line

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
room to move it gives you enough line

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.110 
room to move it gives you enough line
then<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:39.980> get<00:00:40.190> some<00:00:40.370> whip<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.760> end<00:00:40.969> of<00:00:41.059> the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
then and get some whip in the end of the

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.110 
then and get some whip in the end of the
rod<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.989> next<00:00:42.289> thing<00:00:42.440> we<00:00:42.559> do<00:00:42.850> becoming<00:00:43.850> close

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
rod the next thing we do becoming close

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.900 
rod the next thing we do becoming close
here<00:00:44.390> on<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.539> reel<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.280> top<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.699> reel

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
here on the reel and the top of the reel

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.790 
here on the reel and the top of the reel
has<00:00:47.629> around<00:00:48.500> spool<00:00:49.190> on<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.179> pile<00:00:50.480> arm

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
has around spool on it on this pile arm

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.139 
has around spool on it on this pile arm
so<00:00:51.800> what<00:00:52.039> I<00:00:52.070> was<00:00:52.309> trying<00:00:52.609> to<00:00:52.670> do<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.879> make<00:00:53.120> sure

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
so what I was trying to do is make sure

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.020 
so what I was trying to do is make sure
that<00:00:53.420> when<00:00:54.109> you<00:00:54.230> end<00:00:54.469> up<00:00:54.679> lowering<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:55.850> ropes

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
that when you end up lowering the ropes

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.029 
that when you end up lowering the ropes
are<00:00:56.210> seeing<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.600> rod<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.379> then<00:00:57.649> immediately

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
are seeing the rod and then immediately

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.239 
are seeing the rod and then immediately
below<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.239> Gods<00:00:59.480> it's<00:00:59.690> at<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.899> top<00:01:00.140> here<00:01:00.440> it's

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
below the Gods it's at the top here it's

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.549 
below the Gods it's at the top here it's
easy<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.670> reach<00:01:01.910> what<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:02.839> do<00:01:03.019> is<00:01:03.170> just<00:01:03.199> hold

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
easy to reach what you do is just hold

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.280 
easy to reach what you do is just hold
it<00:01:03.679> naturally<00:01:04.040> between<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:05.659> middle<00:01:05.810> fingers

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
it naturally between your middle fingers

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.680 
it naturally between your middle fingers
that's<00:01:06.440> balanced<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.640> whole<00:01:07.790> rod<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.330> just<00:01:08.540> in

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
that's balanced the whole rod is just in

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.860 
that's balanced the whole rod is just in
there<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.200> what<00:01:09.800> I<00:01:09.830> do<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.880> hold<00:01:11.180> of<00:01:11.390> here<00:01:11.600> and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
there and what I do is hold of here and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.540 
there and what I do is hold of here and
open<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.410> Bale<00:01:12.620> arm<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.010> that's<00:01:13.130> that's<00:01:13.430> in

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
open the Bale arm so that's that's in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.400 
open the Bale arm so that's that's in
that<00:01:13.610> position<00:01:13.760> is<00:01:14.030> ready<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.360> cast<00:01:14.600> they're

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
that position is ready to cast they're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.500 
that position is ready to cast they're
most<00:01:15.680> commonly<00:01:16.010> what<00:01:16.370> I<00:01:16.400> see<00:01:16.730> people<00:01:17.060> do<00:01:17.240> is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
most commonly what I see people do is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.600 
most commonly what I see people do is
they've<00:01:17.780> got<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.110> finger<00:01:18.560> tied<00:01:18.830> up<00:01:19.040> against

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
they've got this finger tied up against

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.410 
they've got this finger tied up against
the<00:01:20.210> core<00:01:20.680> on<00:01:21.680> on<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.400> rear<00:01:22.610> on<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.060> rod<00:01:23.270> in

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
the core on on the rear on the rod in

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.840 
the core on on the rear on the rod in
this<00:01:23.540> situation<00:01:24.320> what<00:01:25.190> that's<00:01:25.430> doing

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
this situation what that's doing

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.400 
this situation what that's doing
yes<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:26.240> holding<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> line<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.230> line

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
yes it's holding the line and the line

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.660 
yes it's holding the line and the line
can't<00:01:27.770> come<00:01:28.010> off<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:28.370> you're<00:01:28.520> actually

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
can't come off but you're actually

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.400 
can't come off but you're actually
filling<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.240> cork<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.690> not<00:01:29.870> just<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.230> line

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
filling the cork and not just the line

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.550 
filling the cork and not just the line
before<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.100> pack<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.550> finger<00:01:31.910> off<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.440> is

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
before I pack that finger off like it is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.900 
before I pack that finger off like it is
an<00:01:33.680> actual<00:01:33.950> trigger<00:01:34.310> which<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.550> what<00:01:34.790> it's

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
an actual trigger which is what it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.380 
an actual trigger which is what it's
meant<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.150> be

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
meant to be

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.870 
meant to be
now<00:01:36.020> I'm<00:01:36.260> only<00:01:36.590> filling<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.220> line<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:37.460> haven't

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
now I'm only filling the line I haven't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.880 
now I'm only filling the line I haven't
got<00:01:37.970> interference<00:01:38.480> from<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.840> that's<00:01:39.680> pretty

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
got interference from that that's pretty

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.850 
got interference from that that's pretty
critical<00:01:40.250> when<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:40.790> come<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.180> cast<00:01:41.450> because

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
critical when you come to cast because

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.440 
critical when you come to cast because
if<00:01:42.860> I'm<00:01:43.010> up<00:01:43.220> there<00:01:43.460> I'm<00:01:43.670> not<00:01:43.880> really<00:01:44.090> feeling

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
if I'm up there I'm not really feeling

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.020 
if I'm up there I'm not really feeling
where<00:01:44.900> can<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:45.380> let<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.680> go<00:01:45.890> exactly<00:01:46.310> we're<00:01:46.760> here

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
where can I let it go exactly we're here

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.600 
where can I let it go exactly we're here
I<00:01:47.330> could<00:01:47.960> actually<00:01:48.110> go<00:01:48.410> back<00:01:48.740> forward<00:01:49.520> back

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
I could actually go back forward back

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.660 
I could actually go back forward back
forward<00:01:49.850> back<00:01:50.720> forward<00:01:51.020> as<00:01:52.010> long<00:01:52.190> as<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.430> want

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
forward back forward as long as I want

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.360 
forward back forward as long as I want
to<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.150> until<00:01:53.900> I<00:01:53.930> release<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.710> trigger

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
to and until I release that trigger

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.180 
to and until I release that trigger
because<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.760> can<00:01:55.940> feel<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.330> 100%<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:58.010> line

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
because I can feel it 100% the line

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.100 
because I can feel it 100% the line
isn't<00:01:58.520> going<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.700> come<00:01:58.880> off<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.330> then

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
isn't going to come off so then

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.980 
isn't going to come off so then
literally<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.590> cast<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.510> go<00:02:02.660> back

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
literally the cast all you do is go back

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.560 
literally the cast all you do is go back
and<00:02:03.290> it's<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.100> forward<00:02:04.400> action<00:02:04.700> when<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.240> get<00:02:05.420> to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and it's a forward action when I get to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.670 
and it's a forward action when I get to
about<00:02:05.600> there

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
about there

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.520 
about there
I<00:02:06.740> release<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.310> finger<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.240> then<00:02:09.200> let<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
I release that finger and then let the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.590 
I release that finger and then let the
line<00:02:09.710> come<00:02:10.070> off<00:02:10.250> what<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.240> got<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.570> a
