this up to a very very wet consistency

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.090 
this up to a very very wet consistency
you<00:01:08.470> can<00:01:08.530> see<00:01:09.009> how<00:01:09.970> wet<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.479> material<00:01:11.079> is<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
you can see how wet this material is the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.170 
you can see how wet this material is the
very<00:01:12.400> best<00:01:12.700> way<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:14.350> bond<00:01:14.590> concrete<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.970> to

very best way to bond concrete is to

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.990 
very best way to bond concrete is to
make<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.360> very<00:01:16.690> wet<00:01:17.020> slurry<00:01:17.470> coat<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:18.280> whatever

in<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.070> case<00:01:21.310> we're<00:01:21.550> working<00:01:21.580> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
in this case we're working the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.940 
in this case we're working the
fast-setting<00:01:22.300> cement<00:01:22.840> patcher<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.680> just

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
fast-setting cement patcher and just

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.550 
fast-setting cement patcher and just
using<00:01:24.310> my<00:01:24.340> hand<00:01:24.870> I'm<00:01:25.870> going<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.110> take<00:01:26.350> this

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
using my hand I'm going to take this

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.469 
using my hand I'm going to take this
material<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.580> I'm<00:01:27.790> going<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.000> rub<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.330> into

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
material and I'm going to rub it into

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.460 
material and I'm going to rub it into
all<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.870> pores<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:30.310> slab<00:01:30.670> like<00:01:31.540> this<00:01:31.870> now

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
all the pores on this slab like this now

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.469 
all the pores on this slab like this now
while<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.159> setting<00:01:33.610> I'm<00:01:33.790> going<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.360> add

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
while that is setting I'm going to add

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.840 
while that is setting I'm going to add
more<00:01:34.780> dry<00:01:35.170> powder<00:01:36.570> into<00:01:37.570> my<00:01:37.900> mix<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.760> order<00:01:39.760> to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
more dry powder into my mix in order to

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:58.890 
more dry powder into my mix in order to
get<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.240> stiffer<00:01:40.720> mix

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.270 

you'll<00:01:59.900> notice<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.740> material<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.160> I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
you'll notice that the material that I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.700 
you'll notice that the material that I
apply<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.060> minute<00:02:02.300> ago<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:03.229> fairly

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
apply just a minute ago is now fairly

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.670 
apply just a minute ago is now fairly
dry<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.580> will<00:02:04.790> assist<00:02:05.150> in<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.690> bond<00:02:05.930> now<00:02:06.530> I'm

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
dry this will assist in the bond now I'm

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.699 
dry this will assist in the bond now I'm
going<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.920> take<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.310> stiffer<00:02:07.610> material<00:02:08.709> I'm

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
going to take the stiffer material I'm

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.580 
going to take the stiffer material I'm
going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> place<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:12.020> corner<00:02:12.380> like

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
going to place it on the corner like

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
going to place it on the corner like
this<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.850> using<00:02:14.180> my<00:02:14.330> hand<00:02:14.690> temporarily<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
this just using my hand temporarily as a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.750 
this just using my hand temporarily as a
form<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.810> as<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.709> can<00:02:18.860> see<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.190> material<00:02:19.310> is

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
form and as you can see the material is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.710 
form and as you can see the material is
stiff<00:02:20.030> enough<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.970> not<00:02:23.209> running

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
stiff enough it is it's not running

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.800 
stiff enough it is it's not running
anywhere<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:25.489> can<00:02:25.700> continue<00:02:26.060> place

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
anywhere and I can continue place

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.960 
anywhere and I can continue place
material<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.680> filling<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:28.459> just<00:02:28.880> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
material here filling it just just a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.699 
material here filling it just just a
little<00:02:29.270> bit<00:02:29.390> more<00:02:29.600> than<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.020> need<00:02:30.140> and

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
little bit more than what I need and

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.840 
little bit more than what I need and
then<00:02:31.400> continuing<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.150> push<00:02:32.360> back<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:33.850> this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
then continuing to push back as this

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.870 
then continuing to push back as this
stiffens<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.810> will<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.650> able<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.040> cut<00:02:37.250> away<00:02:37.370> more

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
stiffens I will be able to cut away more

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.370 
stiffens I will be able to cut away more
and<00:02:38.090> more<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:39.130> until<00:02:40.130> I've<00:02:40.310> formed<00:02:40.790> a

90-degree angle here and completed the
repair<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.630> corner
