00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
right now off the bat i'll tell you a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.690 
right now off the bat i'll tell you a
4205<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.719> was<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:59.070> much<00:01:59.250> going

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
4205 it was just really not much going

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
4205 it was just really not much going
on<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.119> unfortunately<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.229> been<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
on and unfortunately that's been the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
on and unfortunately that's been the
case<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.649> bleach<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.460> few<00:02:02.850> weeks<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
case for bleach for a few weeks and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.880 
case for bleach for a few weeks and
that's<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.990> kubo<00:02:04.259> does<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:04.799> he's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that's what I think kubo does when he's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's what I think kubo does when he's
planning<00:02:05.280> his<00:02:05.310> next<00:02:05.460> move<00:02:05.939> unfortunately<00:02:06.840> is

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
