00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.200
 200ml-910g of the television 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:12.289
 Federal Employment Agency 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.439
 It was characteristic, and I spoke in the station building 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.960
 Will reduce air resistance 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.300
 How many kilos 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.440
 Compact to open and fly straight on Fujitsu Island 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 That's right 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.349
 Oh, it looks a bit fat to say the same thing 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 It feels like floating but 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.440
 I received the minister but I can see it by looking at the cat's head 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.000
 It is about the price 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.910
 Rather for pc 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 That's what it feels like 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
 Drain 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 I went to the target of the German line 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.130
 Dumping out silently hp 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.130
 In this way 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 Basically 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.380
 Selfishly 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 It is easy to push big in the same district 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 Lesner went 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.790
 A large stage where Japanese banks are influenced by jumpers 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.830
 Support this 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.550
 Aichi Komaki City is a bit out of focus 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.910
 I was lost 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.160
 In terms of distance 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 There is only 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.019
 A little bit 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.179
 Eco Generally speaking, it may be a bit difficult 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.650
 Don't think about diving because it's a vertical jump 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.469
 Vertical but 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.869
 I thought more 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.179
 Old fashioned 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.179
 First of this season 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 I also want an arrangement 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.479
 Nursery school corresponding 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.149
 In the third major 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.939
 Sideways looking sideways candidates 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.029
 Takayuki Suzuki of Status Meter 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.489
 Is this a powerful one?
