00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
affect the loops on the right zone I'll

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:51.819 
affect the loops on the right zone I'll
turn<00:03:40.579> off<00:03:40.820> all<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.120> other<00:03:41.390> zones<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:50.769> want<00:03:51.769> to

turn off all the other zones I want to

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.130 
turn off all the other zones I want to
just<00:03:52.040> affect<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:53.150> sound<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.600> middle<00:03:53.900> here

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
just affect the sound of the middle here

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.210 
just affect the sound of the middle here
I'll<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:55.280> choose<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:55.910> middle<00:03:56.329> zone<00:04:00.070> or<00:04:01.070> if

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
I'll just choose this middle zone or if

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.740 
I'll just choose this middle zone or if
I<00:04:01.340> want<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.790> other<00:04:01.940> zones<00:04:02.209> we<00:04:02.510> have<00:04:02.630> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
I want the other zones we have the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.340 
I want the other zones we have the
effect<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.410> always<00:04:03.890> liked<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:05.019> this<00:04:06.019> does<00:04:06.230> I

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
effect I always liked it this does I

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.349 
effect I always liked it this does I
control<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.890> effects<00:04:07.250> those<00:04:07.880> are<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.090> only

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
control the effects those are the only

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:21.409 
control the effects those are the only
sounds<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.049> right<00:04:09.230> zone<00:04:09.470> sound<00:04:09.829> affected

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.999 

this<00:04:22.419> makes<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.780> easier<00:04:23.199> to<00:04:23.229> have<00:04:23.470> sound<00:04:23.830> like

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
this makes it easier to have sound like

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.950 
this makes it easier to have sound like
a<00:04:24.039> vocal<00:04:24.520> swimming<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.030> effects<00:04:25.389> but<00:04:25.660> still

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
have a dr drum part outing away and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.370 
have a dr drum part outing away and
keeping<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.509> group<00:04:30.870> by<00:04:31.870> hitting<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.229> record

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
keeping it group by hitting the record

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.379 
keeping it group by hitting the record
button<00:04:32.650> i<00:04:32.949> can<00:04:33.099> now<00:04:33.220> create<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.610> new<00:04:33.849> loop<00:04:34.120> using

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
button i can now create a new loop using

00:04:34.389 --> 00:06:11.250 
button i can now create a new loop using
the<00:04:34.570> mic<00:04:34.750> on<00:04:34.930> my<00:04:35.050> ipad<00:04:35.550> here<00:04:36.550> goes

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.900 

so<00:06:12.260> Luke<00:06:12.410> task<00:06:12.650> has<00:06:12.890> been<00:06:12.920> recording<00:06:13.550> my<00:06:13.670> moves

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
so Luke task has been recording my moves

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.060 
so Luke task has been recording my moves
in<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.150> background<00:06:14.630> ever<00:06:15.260> since<00:06:15.530> I<00:06:15.680> selected

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
in the background ever since I selected

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.150 
in the background ever since I selected
my<00:06:16.130> first<00:06:16.460> loop<00:06:16.670> set<00:06:17.380> so<00:06:18.380> now<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:18.590> can<00:06:18.620> save<00:06:19.130> my

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
my first loop set so now I can save my

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.430 
my first loop set so now I can save my
performance<00:06:20.320> I'll<00:06:21.320> call<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.950> my<00:06:22.280> mix<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:23.440> it

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
performance I'll call it my mix and it

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.860 
performance I'll call it my mix and it
saves<00:06:24.710> out<00:06:24.950> as<00:06:25.130> an<00:06:25.310> uncompressed<00:06:25.820> audio<00:06:26.150> file

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.410 

now<00:06:29.870> I<00:06:29.930> can<00:06:30.200> export<00:06:30.590> that<00:06:30.710> to<00:06:30.860> my<00:06:31.250> computer<00:06:31.610> so

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
now I can export that to my computer so

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.060 
now I can export that to my computer so
I<00:06:32.450> can<00:06:32.540> use<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:32.900> within<00:06:33.200> some<00:06:33.590> other<00:06:33.740> audio

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
I can use it within some other audio

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.330 
I can use it within some other audio
software<00:06:36.820> or<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:37.880> can<00:06:38.210> share<00:06:38.480> my<00:06:38.510> mix<00:06:38.930> on
