else<00:02:58.840> anything<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.379> with<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> crash<00:02:59.859> but

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
else anything to do with the crash but

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.780 
else anything to do with the crash but
just<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.659> setup<00:03:02.379> maybe<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.129> tracks<00:03:03.370> change<00:03:03.640> a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
just the setup maybe the tracks change a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.970 
just the setup maybe the tracks change a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
strong but right annex that I think I

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.380 
strong but right annex that I think I
