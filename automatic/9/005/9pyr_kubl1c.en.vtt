in LA I wasn't planning to get tired but
I<00:00:15.900> saw<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> lot<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.529> little<00:00:16.800> girls<00:00:17.070> carrying<00:00:17.490> her

I saw a lot of little girls carrying her
around<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.900> thought<00:00:19.140> she<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.770> gorgeous

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220

playing<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.050> her<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.099> point<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
playing to get her at that point and so

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.650 
playing to get her at that point and so
she<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:27.750> had<00:00:27.960> her<00:00:28.140> hair<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> braids<00:00:29.189> since

2006<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> ends<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.460> straight<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
2006 the ends are pretty straight at the

2006 the ends are pretty straight at the
bottom<00:00:34.579> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.210> time<00:00:36.420> though<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.989> go

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
bottom I think it's time though to go

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
bottom I think it's time though to go
ahead<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> take<00:00:37.620> her<00:00:37.770> hair<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.219> hoping<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ahead and take her hair out I'm hoping I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.940 
ahead and take her hair out I'm hoping I
don't<00:00:38.670> regret<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.559> reason<00:00:40.739> I'm

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
don't regret it but one reason I'm

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
don't regret it but one reason I'm
videoing<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.629> like

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
videoing it in that way if I don't like

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.619 
videoing it in that way if I don't like
it<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> used<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> look<00:00:44.070> like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.260 
in the newer wig is silky and easier to
manage<00:01:40.410> I'm<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.550> I<00:01:41.580> have

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.890
