00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.690
 hello that as is is good because today 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.509
 in the video of how you see you see like that 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.059
 a bubble of freixenet we will find 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.860
 some proposals for outfits that although 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.869
 they have still made whitney war for the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.330
 parties and among them has recorded this 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.170
 look but I'm going to take advantage of recording them 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.029
 more useful because I know it's hard to think that 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.160
 put on parties and all this mess 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.320
 Then, apart from that, I tell you about those who have 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.169
 recorded that there is a bit of giving a 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.240
 dress is there some skirt some 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.190
 dress pants or so but this in 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.960
 concrete I will record it alone without light and 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.470
 I tell you that the look would be this that this 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.910
 for example and for those that you do not like 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.440
 the dress pants for which 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.990
 we like the skirts for which we 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.760
 like in dresses, well, you have 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.860
 the option also because not to go with a 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.800
 jeans and jeans 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.750
 knowing combine hunting sapito 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.310
 combine the parts above it 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.440
 They can also be a good option for 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.780
 to dress because there is no to go 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 even then it's partying and then 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.920
 I have prepared a series of office already 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.390
 I tell you most are with a boat a 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.810
 normal jeans 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.460
 Cowboy color cowboy with a short and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.070
 a little high waist so it's a 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 little more to dress and well then one of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.880
 the parts above is going to be this is going to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.940
 there are several others this is my maybe my 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.860
 option more more than I like and also 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.410
 is that I tell you that they are things in this 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.450
 video I think this whole body and 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.509
 mustard that I showed you recently in a 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.190
 hall the rest I had everything or not 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.810
 you have to invest to go 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.740
 party or anything this I had it of the year 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.479
 past 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.800
 the other shirts or be all the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.590
 body that is new in the three shirts 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.890
 which is what I am going to show you in the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.320
 video also had them a long time ago 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.780
 also the two shirts that are with 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.740
 swimmer's back and the other one that has 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.380
 here black 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.170
 with this golden brown I have them 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.880
 lots of years and I think we're going that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.560
 that always lasts because although you say 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.000
 good are for special occasions and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.039
 that but good always in this time 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.320
 you remember a bit of those things and 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.540
 If you do not have because you get such courage but 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.520
 Even so, I'm telling you, there's another one I'm telling you 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.530
 otherwise you can get him 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.570
 down then a skirt with sequins and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.630
 above go simpler but in this case 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.250
 As I tell you, it's going to go cowboy and I think 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.710
 which are three or four with jeans 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.320
 dark and bone with cowboy color cowboy 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.000
 and two with a black cowboy who also 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.800
 pretty dresses and why not be 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.270
 bring a cowboy has come with something 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.450
 over a little more arranged and you 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.550
 Heels and it looks perfect as soon as 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.130
 I have put shoes on the shoes 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.960
 put some stilettos so you can see that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.020
 nor do you need to go 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.450
 dress or trousers or dress 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.400
 skirt in these holidays either and because 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 go black then I the first two 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.610
 options that I have put the ankle boots 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.800
 blacks I wear the black jeans pants 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.410
 but in the other options even in the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.209
 I wear this top I've put some 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.410
 brown stilettos that is that it is not 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.480
 it has to be all black let's say and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.030
 nothing that I hope you like, I do not think 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.930
 I'm going to talk 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.180
 between a 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.799
 between 1 or fit and another that I will put 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.989
 followed because I think with this 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.760
 introduction is already enough so that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.680
 It gets too long because I want to upload it 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.359
 fast and that this one I'm telling you before 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.879
 from poinsettia before New Year's Eve and 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.780

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.609
 I like you to give you ideas about everything and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.650
