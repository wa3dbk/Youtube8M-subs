there's some hair of mine in here and
you<00:01:40.490> know<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:41.030> really<00:01:41.390> when<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.900> tease<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
you know and really when you tease the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.400 
you know and really when you tease the
hair<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:43.040> hair<00:01:43.250> doesn't<00:01:43.640> go<00:01:43.970> inside<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:45.200> the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
hair the hair doesn't go inside like the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.770 
hair the hair doesn't go inside like the
comb<00:01:45.710> become<00:01:46.190> kind<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.580> ring<00:01:46.730> rips<00:01:47.360> her<00:01:47.570> hair

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
comb become kind of ring rips her hair

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.470 
comb become kind of ring rips her hair
and<00:01:47.990> instead<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.880> makes<00:01:49.880> kind<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.330> like<00:01:50.450> a

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
and instead this makes kind of like a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.080 
and instead this makes kind of like a
fuzzy<00:01:50.930> type<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.560> backcombing<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.850> don't<00:01:53.030> know

fuzzy type of backcombing I don't know

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.780 
fuzzy type of backcombing I don't know
it's<00:01:53.270> really<00:01:53.330> weird<00:01:53.690> this<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.890> didn't<00:01:55.250> pay<00:01:55.460> for

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
it's really weird this I didn't pay for

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.600 
it's really weird this I didn't pay for
because<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.240> was<00:01:56.360> complimentary<00:01:56.840> with<00:01:57.610> my

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
because it was complimentary with my
