lash in and what this is gonna do is

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.140 
lash in and what this is gonna do is
it's<00:04:10.560> going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.829> mend<00:04:11.189> your<00:04:11.370> natural<00:04:11.970> lash

lashes prior this really helps to get
the<00:04:38.400> lash<00:04:38.580> comfortable<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.780> wear<00:04:39.990> they<00:04:40.650> may

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
the lash comfortable to wear they may

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.590 
the lash comfortable to wear they may
not<00:04:41.010> be<00:04:41.070> seeing<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.639> as<00:04:41.729> much<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.300> not<00:04:42.449> as

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
not be seeing it as much it's not as

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.159 
not be seeing it as much it's not as
heavy<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:44.070> it<00:04:44.370> just<00:04:44.550> feels<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:45.060> little<00:04:45.300> more

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
heavy and it just feels a little more

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.469 
heavy and it just feels a little more
natural<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.430> again<00:04:47.669> just<00:04:47.699> place<00:04:48.030> your<00:04:48.180> finger

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
mended together so it doesn't look all

mended together so it doesn't look all
funky<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.120> because<00:05:06.630> nothing's<00:05:06.960> worse<00:05:07.169> than

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
funky and because nothing's worse than
