00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello it's time for a haircut 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.360
 daddy 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:16.049
 it is necessary to mow dad took machine is not 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.010
 charged battery there inside took 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.960
 power supply set turned on 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.019
 light bulb does not work were 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.429
 such moments are already here somewhere 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.710
 twisted the resort pulled it earned 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:38.750
 it's show time the wire is not spinning and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 everything means here is very well worth it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.030
 the wire does not break anywhere and here it is 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.710
 you know this is a disease in blocks 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 especially when the unit is closed completely behind 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.320
 I have already made some melted sweat 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.079
 still decide to remove the clip but I very 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.079
 I will say this in this case 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.080
 block monolithic that is, unleash it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.930
 nowhere is it possible in so many cases 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.610
 blocks make monolithic times gone 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.710
 nutrition 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.130
 Well, you need to buy a new unit and what to do 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 if not if block 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 let's say there is some kind of specific or 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.119
 you need to buy now you need to go as 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.390
 in our case 70 kilometers to the city 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.460
 and spend another day to find or 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.110
 order to come in two weeks 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.259
 I ordered to order yes at home 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 conditions try to fix this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.200
 the situation itself I took a detachable grinder 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.549
 metal disk 1 and 2 mm thickness 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.229
 that is, thin and this disc walked 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.540
 That's how neatly I Bulgarian 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.369
 Adjustable by turns neatly 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.829
 walked along the seam 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.730
 in all directions and what we have 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.910
 it turned out that we have we have 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.910
 open blog 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.170
 open blog 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.720
 cut the string right here it is labeled 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.090
 red black ie white black 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.239
 here it is clear white black here this part 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.739
 the choice here is soldered and there will be a block by 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.890
 new work then his little 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.170
 sand down here and or with tape or 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.860
 Scotch tape or glue back 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 close the lid 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.680
 due to the fact that as if I opened 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:57.690
 grinder she straightened plastic and very 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:03:00.360
 easy to shoot the edge will be smooth i bottom 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.549
 I could not solder because it is uncomfortable here 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.959
 very simple soldered on top here 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.660
 tied knot 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.440
 that here it will be laid here 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.109
 I wrap a little bit now 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.870
 electrical tape and we will close here closed 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.400
 him in a hurry 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.350
 because glue here suddenly 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.299
 wrong somewhere somewhere suddenly somewhere 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.920
 need to be forged or even well 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.310
 I have it on the glue you can not plant 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.750
 put on silicone sealant around 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:40.220
 but while here and so and so I hitched 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.220
 moment of truth working 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.030
 output monolithic power supply at home 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.920
 conditions can be neatly opened 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.099
 repair 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.099
 use further
