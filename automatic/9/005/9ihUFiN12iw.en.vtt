00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we do have a ps3 controller here we'll

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
we do have a ps3 controller here we'll
be<00:00:51.449> unboxing

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:09.679 

start<00:00:57.579> off<00:00:57.730> with<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.000> sides<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:07.590> open<00:01:08.590> this

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
start off with the sides this open this

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.279 
start off with the sides this open this
and<00:01:10.689> I<00:01:11.250> guess<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.560> packaging<00:01:16.289> not

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
and I guess this is the packaging not

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.230 
and I guess this is the packaging not
very<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:20.020> but<00:01:20.380> still<00:01:21.220> here<00:01:21.520> it's<00:01:21.700> open<00:01:22.149> up

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
very good but still here it's open up

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.770 
very good but still here it's open up
let's<00:01:23.110> hope<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.350> controller<00:01:23.710> isn't<00:01:23.979> damaged

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
let's hope the controller isn't damaged

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.050 
let's hope the controller isn't damaged
so<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:27.070> just<00:01:27.340> shipping<00:01:28.180> paper<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.750> guess<00:01:29.020> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
so it's just shipping paper I guess so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.230 
so it's just shipping paper I guess so
the<00:01:31.060> controller<00:01:31.600> itself<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:39.030> nothing<00:01:40.030> else

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
the controller itself right nothing else

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.539 
the controller itself right nothing else
here<00:01:42.060> shipping<00:01:43.060> papers<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.619> to

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
here shipping papers that's it to

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:55.039 
here shipping papers that's it to
control

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.920 

screw<00:01:56.049> it<00:01:56.530> plastic

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.370 

so<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.229> is<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.619> controller<00:02:04.930> has<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.960> nice

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
so this is the controller has a nice

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.860 
so this is the controller has a nice
feel<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.470> did<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.670> did<00:02:11.630> get

just think that that's only be quiet for

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.479 
just think that that's only be quiet for
this<00:02:58.629> video<00:02:58.989> don't<00:02:59.739> hear<00:02:59.980> no<00:03:00.099> background

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
noises and they say to turn on the mod

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.729 
noises and they say to turn on the mod
on<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.629> website<00:03:05.189> you<00:03:06.189> just<00:03:06.400> hit<00:03:06.519> select<00:03:06.790> and

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
on the website you just hit select and

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.080 
on the website you just hit select and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
the mod is an orange and will blink once

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.879 
the mod is an orange and will blink once

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.699 
many times so let's go to mode 3 click
it<00:03:19.150> two<00:03:19.269> times<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.900> it's<00:03:20.859> mode<00:03:21.700> 3<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:23.319> think

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
it two times and it's mode 3 and I think

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.629 
it two times and it's mode 3 and I think
this<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.159> Kimbo<00:03:24.760> rapid<00:03:25.209> fire<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:27.310> sure

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
this is a Kimbo rapid fire but not sure

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.690 
this is a Kimbo rapid fire but not sure
so<00:03:28.200> go<00:03:29.200> ahead<00:03:29.290> turn<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.829> off<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:33.459> is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
so go ahead turn this off and that is

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.959 
so go ahead turn this off and that is
the<00:03:33.970> moderate<00:03:34.420> control
