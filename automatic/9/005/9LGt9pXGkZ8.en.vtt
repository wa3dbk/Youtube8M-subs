00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
this so overall I think that has pretty

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
this so overall I think that has pretty
great<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.160> pretty<00:00:41.670> wide<00:00:42.000> since<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> U

great that's pretty wide since the U
version<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.890> wider<00:00:44.129> than<00:00:44.219> most<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
version but it's a bit wider than most I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
version but it's a bit wider than most I
you<00:00:44.940> heads<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.420> opinion<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.710> too

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you heads in my opinion it's not too

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
you heads in my opinion it's not too
stiff<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.370> too<00:00:47.520> flexible<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> guy

the<00:01:02.129> side<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.579> set<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> lot<00:01:03.480> easier

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the side will set up it's a lot easier

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
the side will set up it's a lot easier
