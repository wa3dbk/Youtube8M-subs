00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
an eye and a three-quarter view which

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.410 
an eye and a three-quarter view which
means<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.460> it's<00:00:05.580> gonna<00:00:05.700> be<00:00:05.819> turned<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.180> way

means that it's gonna be turned this way
and<00:00:06.600> there's<00:00:06.720> gonna<00:00:06.810> be<00:00:06.930> perspective<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
and there's gonna be perspective the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.100 
and there's gonna be perspective the
terrible<00:00:08.700> P<00:00:08.910> worry<00:00:09.150> don't<00:00:09.599> worry<00:00:09.780> we'll<00:00:10.019> make

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
terrible P worry don't worry we'll make

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.730 
terrible P worry don't worry we'll make
it<00:00:10.170> easy<00:00:10.349> put<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> eyes<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.429> eye<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:11.969> so

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
it easy put the eyes in the eye like so

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
it easy put the eyes in the eye like so
now<00:00:13.740> notice<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.549> side<00:00:15.289> it's<00:00:16.289> gonna<00:00:16.440> look

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
now notice on this side it's gonna look

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.189 
now notice on this side it's gonna look
like<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.830> tilts<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.279> slightly<00:00:17.880> see<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.660> Isaac

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
like a tilts up slightly see that Isaac

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.130 
like a tilts up slightly see that Isaac
moqueca<00:00:19.439> tilts<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:19.980> slightly<00:00:20.750> that's<00:00:21.750> because

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
moqueca tilts up slightly that's because

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.429 
moqueca tilts up slightly that's because
it's<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.330> close<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:27.109> the<00:00:28.109> bridge<00:00:28.320> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
it's going to be close to the bridge of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.820 
it's going to be close to the bridge of
the<00:00:28.470> nose<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> we'll<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.260> her<00:00:31.439> looking<00:00:31.710> up

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the nose so we'll have her looking up

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.220 
the nose so we'll have her looking up
this<00:00:31.949> way<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:35.329> this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.809> bridge<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> those

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this way and this is the bridge of those

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:53.800 
this way and this is the bridge of those
goes<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.710> into<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.190> eyebrow

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.970 

you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:15.590 

continuing<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.070> eyes

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.490 

you

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.400 

you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.109 

all<00:01:30.410> right<00:01:30.710> continuing<00:01:31.430> on

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.929 

now<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.719> see<00:01:36.929> how<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.200> tucks<00:01:37.590> under<00:01:38.100> right

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
now you see how this tucks under right

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:57.179 
now you see how this tucks under right
here

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.370 

now<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.119> one<00:01:58.299> that's<00:01:58.329> near<00:01:58.630> us<00:01:58.749> is<00:01:58.929> obviously

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
now the one that's near us is obviously

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.590 
now the one that's near us is obviously
much<00:01:59.679> bigger<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.340> we're<00:02:01.240> exaggerating

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
much bigger and we're exaggerating

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.080 
much bigger and we're exaggerating
because<00:02:02.049> they're<00:02:02.170> cartoons<00:02:02.789> but<00:02:03.789> still<00:02:03.999> it

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
because they're cartoons but still it

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.980 
because they're cartoons but still it
gives<00:02:04.240> us<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.509> nice<00:02:04.659> look<00:02:05.020> makes<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.859> look<00:02:06.039> like

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
gives us a nice look makes it look like

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.890 
gives us a nice look makes it look like
three-dimensional<00:02:12.540> because<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.690> round

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
three-dimensional because it's round

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:56.280 
three-dimensional because it's round
that<00:02:14.260> way

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.910 

and<00:02:56.890> we<00:02:57.220> add<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> little<00:02:57.700> bit<00:02:57.879> of<00:02:58.000> shadow<00:02:58.330> here

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
and we add a little bit of shadow here

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.679 
and we add a little bit of shadow here
so<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.010> looks<00:03:00.069> like<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.459> trailing<00:03:01.269> away<00:03:01.329> from

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
so it looks like it's trailing away from

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.080 
so it looks like it's trailing away from
us<00:03:01.840> again<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.489> distance<00:03:03.909> is<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
us again because the distance is a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.839 
us again because the distance is a
little<00:03:04.329> further<00:03:04.569> from<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.959> other<00:03:05.079> one<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.790> we

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
little further from the other one and we

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.399 
little further from the other one and we
extend<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.049> is<00:03:14.170> touching

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
extend this I so that this is touching

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:28.720 
extend this I so that this is touching
it<00:03:14.560> as<00:03:14.709> well<00:03:15.390> right<00:03:16.390> here<00:03:16.750> that's<00:03:17.230> right

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.870 

you<00:03:29.180> use<00:03:29.480> these<00:03:29.630> his<00:03:29.810> striations<00:03:30.440> in<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.650> hair

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
you use these his striations in the hair

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:41.809 
you use these his striations in the hair
just<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.970> nice<00:03:32.150> look

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.610 

and<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:42.689> we<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.319> had<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> 3/4<00:03:44.459> view
