turn together here's what it looks like
starting<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> basic<00:00:12.230> then<00:00:13.230> doing<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
starting with the basic then doing the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.960 
starting with the basic then doing the
push<00:00:13.710> out<00:00:14.540> now<00:00:15.540> doing<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.049> tuck<00:00:16.350> turn<00:00:16.880> into<00:00:17.880> an

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
push out now doing a tuck turn into an

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510 
push out now doing a tuck turn into an
East<00:00:18.119> Coast<00:00:18.330> basic<00:00:19.160> don't<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.340> worry

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
East Coast basic don't really worry

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.070 
East Coast basic don't really worry
about<00:00:20.699> what's<00:00:20.850> coming<00:00:21.000> after<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.570> move<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
about what's coming after this move I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
about what's coming after this move I
just<00:00:22.350> did<00:00:22.529> kind<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> an<00:00:23.039> East<00:00:23.160> Coast<00:00:23.369> basic<00:00:23.519> but

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
just did kind of an East Coast basic but

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.820 
just did kind of an East Coast basic but
it<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:24.449> doesn't<00:00:24.720> matter<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.619> next

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it really doesn't matter in the next

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.960 
it really doesn't matter in the next
clip<00:00:26.010> we're<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.340> talk<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.760> many

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
clip we're going to talk about many

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.400 
clip we're going to talk about many
different<00:00:27.060> things<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.930> right

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
different things that we can do right

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
different things that we can do right
now<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> focus<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.539> hands

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
now we just want to focus on the hands

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.520 
now we just want to focus on the hands
working<00:00:31.769> together<00:00:32.390> leaders<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.989> talked<00:00:34.260> about

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
working together leaders we talked about

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
working together leaders we talked about
it<00:00:34.620> before<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> remind<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.000> here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
it before just want to remind you here

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.240 
it before just want to remind you here
it's<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.469> its<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.489> her<00:00:38.640> eye<00:00:38.879> level<00:00:39.149> as

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
it's up its up at her eye level as

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
it's up its up at her eye level as
opposed<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.969> were<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.090> doing<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.570> push

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
opposed to if we were just doing a push

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
opposed to if we were just doing a push
out<00:00:42.899> right<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.440> into<00:00:43.649> tandem<00:00:44.160> it'd<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.489> low

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
out right back into tandem it'd be low

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.500 
out right back into tandem it'd be low
and<00:00:45.600> she<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.350> cycles<00:00:46.800> right<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.250> around

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
and she just cycles right back around

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.380 
and she just cycles right back around
see<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> distinction<00:00:48.930> again<00:00:49.789> low<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:51.180> back

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
see the distinction again low to go back

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.500 
see the distinction again low to go back
into<00:00:51.629> tandem<00:00:52.789> higher<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.300> her<00:00:54.480> eye

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
into tandem higher and about her eye

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
into tandem higher and about her eye
level<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:55.410> gonna<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:56.010> into<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
level if we're gonna go back into the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.990 
level if we're gonna go back into the
Tuck<00:00:56.520> turn<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> from<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.910> do

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
Tuck turn and from here we can do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.760 
Tuck turn and from here we can do
anything<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.390> want

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
anything we want

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
anything we want
yeah<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.430> other<00:01:02.579> thing<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
yeah the other thing is so if we have it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.390 
yeah the other thing is so if we have it
nice<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.199> high<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.650> Jason<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.070> talking

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
nice and high like Jason was talking

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.830 
nice and high like Jason was talking
about<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> also<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
about then we can also get that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
about then we can also get that
compression<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> notice<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.189> we're

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
compression and if you notice when we're

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
compression and if you notice when we're
saying<00:01:08.520> high<00:01:08.729> there's<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> specific<00:01:09.600> height<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
saying high there's a specific height to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370 
saying high there's a specific height to
the<00:01:10.470> high<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.970> much<00:01:12.210> maybe<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the high so it's pretty much maybe the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200 
the high so it's pretty much maybe the
bottom<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> hands<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.460> matching<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.939> chin

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bottom of the hands are matching my chin

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
bottom of the hands are matching my chin
something<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.770> gonna<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.100> if

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
something like that so it's gonna be if

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
something like that so it's gonna be if
it's<00:01:17.490> super<00:01:17.880> low<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.570> awkward<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.200> me

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it's super low then it's awkward for me

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's super low then it's awkward for me
to<00:01:19.380> lean<00:01:19.500> into<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.100> high<00:01:20.280> there's<00:01:20.580> no

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to lean into it if it's high there's no

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
to lean into it if it's high there's no
way<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.270> use<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.600> compression<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.170> do

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
way I can use that compression to do

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
way I can use that compression to do
anything<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.540> leaders<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.780> sure<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> match

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
anything so leaders make sure you match

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
anything so leaders make sure you match
it<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> follower<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.549> other<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it up to the follower the other thing is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
it up to the follower the other thing is
to<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.360> sure<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.650> our

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
to make sure that it's kind of on our

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.510 
to make sure that it's kind of on our
center<00:01:29.430> axis<00:01:29.820> okay<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.439> way<00:01:31.770> over<00:01:32.130> here

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
center axis okay if it's way over here

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910 
center axis okay if it's way over here
it<00:01:33.180> causes<00:01:33.630> her<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.900> step<00:01:34.170> more<00:01:34.439> than<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.650> really

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it causes her to step more than I really

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.940 
it causes her to step more than I really
want<00:01:35.159> okay<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> idea<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> after<00:01:37.799> we've

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
want okay so the idea is after we've

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.719 
want okay so the idea is after we've
done<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.750> five<00:01:39.750> boom<00:01:40.619> give<00:01:41.430> her<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
done this five boom give her that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
done this five boom give her that
compression<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.329> away<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.630> she<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.140> think

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
compression right away so she can think

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
compression right away so she can think
into<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:45.030> wait<00:01:45.329> until<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.170> over

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
into that if we wait until it's way over

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
into that if we wait until it's way over
here<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:47.939> mess<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.299> her

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
here it's really gonna mess up her

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
here it's really gonna mess up her
mechanics<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.140> can't<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.860> short<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.790> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
mechanics so we can't be so short or so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
mechanics so we can't be so short or so
far<00:01:51.329> away<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.890> line

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
far away just really much right on line

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
far away just really much right on line
without<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.610> another<00:01:53.640> yeah<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.960> time

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
without one another yeah you have time

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.700 
without one another yeah you have time
for<00:01:55.170> another<00:01:55.259> angle<00:01:55.820> sure<00:01:56.820> why<00:01:57.119> not

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
for another angle sure why not

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
for another angle sure why not
yeah<00:01:58.850> sure<00:01:59.850> okay<00:02:01.549> okay

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.400 

push<00:02:07.960> out<00:02:08.340> back<00:02:09.340> up<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.479> around<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.230> then

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
push out back up and around and then

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:20.160 
push out back up and around and then
back<00:02:11.590> around<00:02:17.010> that'll<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.070> it
