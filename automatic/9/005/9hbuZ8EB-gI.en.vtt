00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.651
 Take off the long day's mask and rush to the border of dreams 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.031
 Midnight in pumpkin carriage replaced with fairytale glass shoes 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.421
 Let me enjoy this feeling. I am a proud rose. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.841
 Let me taste the unfamiliar world of this chaotic world 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.221
 Yesterday too close tomorrow, too far to listen to the night 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.021
 I kissed the lotus leaf in the evening wind and let me drunk at the poolside. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.851
 Wait until you clearly see my beautiful moonlight drying tears 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:35.661
 Which person loves me and holds my hand 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:57.491
 Hold me, kiss me, love, don’t go. 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.381
 Hide your tiredness and express your wolverine 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.931
 Indulge your wildness and find your own tomorrow 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.841
 The oath you ask for is even your lie. 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.681
 I need the comfort of love, even if the love is already like a tide. 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.901
 Yesterday too close tomorrow, too far to listen to the night 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.831
 I kissed the lotus leaf in the evening wind and let me drunk at the poolside. 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.761
 Wait until you clearly see my beautiful moonlight drying tears 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:09.171
 Which person loves me and holds my hand 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.371
 Hold me, kiss me, love, don’t go. 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:32.221
 Which person loves me and holds my hand 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:55.391
 Hold me, kiss me, love, don’t go. 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.021
 Hold me, kiss me, love, don’t go. 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.030
 Hold me, kiss me, love, don’t go.
