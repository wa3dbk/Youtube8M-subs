00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.739
 by the cartoon network studios although the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.780
 television show us a history 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 fun of every holy day 3 in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.700
 society in the years and the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.470
 super mystical powers nobody imagines 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.049
 that behind this whole universe of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.330
 colors and fantasies may be something 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.640
 terrible quite disturbing the three 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.830
 little girls alone cute and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.630
 distortion are in fact traces of a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.580
 unique personality whose name is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 unknown by the public then here 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.350
 Let's baptize the raven this girl. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.509
 suffers from five mental illnesses 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.090

 schizophrenia disorder 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.360
 personality for the night and disorder 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.340
 of depersonalization between the girl 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.899
 vichy upset because of the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.149
 development of 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.070
 multiple personality comes from the abuses 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.049
 who come suffered in childhood by his brother 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.420
 the older one represented in the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.420
 her associations like a crazy monkey 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.850
 biggest enemy of heroines 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.979
 We started with a little girl, she's small. 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.110
 I have blue eyes and a hair 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.680
 blonde always tied it symbolizes the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.350
 innocence newspaper the raven 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.729
 is not submissive weeping but in rare 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.220
 occasions it becomes unmanageable 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.320
 aggressive mind symbolizing raven 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 wanting to shred his brother, however. 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.940
 greatest of these frustrations is manifested in 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.680
 Sweet, it was already mine, it's a girl. 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.050
 smart has eyes 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 brown and long hair and symbolizes 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.300
 that they relive whenever they are or 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.520
 be mature and safe witty she acts 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.350
 as leader in most situations and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.300
 always succeed in coming to terms with 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.490
 the other two personalities 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.830
 while the candy is a bit rough it has 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.660
 green eyes and black hair short she 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.760
 symbolizes the thoughts of hostage 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.980
 retaliation against his brother 's 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.640
 revealed yesterday prudent stubborn and mouth 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.440
 dirty 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.450
 Yes it is a side of her that is deeply 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.800
 Affectionate with the people you love 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.620
 but this is the other two 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.690
 as she had already said 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.459
 manifests a little more in the line we have 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.500
 also a crazy monkey that monkey 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.300
 black hat with a hat over a 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.760
 your skull and your brain is totally 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.310
 visible it was created by the teacher the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.260
 Tonio figure pages to nations and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.450
 super powerful girls were created 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.340
 Then, and there you ask me, it's more than 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.410
 that the crazy monkey has to do with all 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.450
 this good theory is where it begins to 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.640
 make sense crazy monkey and girls 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.560
 super powerful are related because 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.420
 they share the same creator in the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.890
 reality your creator the teacher the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.870
 Tonho is your father. 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.660
 the relationship between girls and a monkey 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.000
 crazy is actually Germanity in the drawing 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.470
 they are constantly in conflict 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.170
 posttraumatic stress disorder 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.209
 dm developed for being accused 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.280
 constantly by his brother trauma of 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.799
 have to fight and defend themselves from it all 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.080
 the days manifest in this way the 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.700
 crazy monkey even reveals the episode 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.890
 who feels jealous of the love the teacher 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.190
 Antonio dedicates to the girls that in fact 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.320
 the rage of the rave world in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.269
 all the villains featured in the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.860
 drawing are manifestations of abuse 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.140
 suffered by her and her demons 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.790
 schizophrenia for those who do not 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.910
 know is characterized by hallucinations 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.310
 visual aids on tv to fat vivas 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.350
 in this case the three personalities of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.209
 raven make sense if we judge 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.920
 that the girls are completely gone 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.930
 of reality companies in children's glasses 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.639
 being that almost all the villains of form 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.799
 of dolls and toys 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.200
 suggesting that raven has long suffered from 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.090
 young woman there is not a day in the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.520
 life of the super powerful in which a villain 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.350
 attack or conspire against peace in the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.540
 city the mayor owns a telephone 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.250
 to get in touch with them 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.990
 in case something goes wrong happen 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.300
 girls are not consciously 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.680
 worried all the time about something or 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.530
 someone attacking the city 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.450
 but always some time during the day 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.950
 in which they hear an alert in 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.110
 forced to drop everything they are 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.060
 doing to go to another mayor is 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.550
 better definition in anguish and the fear 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.410
 in the mind of Rimini the alert is always sounded 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.540
 that your brother is approaching her fact 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.370
 seeing yourself as heroin allows you to 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.680
 feel worth something in your 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.840
 world because physical and emotional abuse 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.130
 your brother's constant 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.710
 your self esteem 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.090
 another disease that girls are 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.460
 sufferers are personality disorder 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.590
 for the night the paranoia that the girls 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.419
 feel immediately obvious to the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.700
 public because it has a more 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.889
 deep in my girls are always 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.140
 prey in their gay world in have much 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.880
 real fear and can not deal with your 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.070
 idea of ​​being locked up in a hospital 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.990
 for the rest of life itself a world of 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.120
 Their fantasy fantasies are 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.400
 heroines who have effective powers 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.770
 to fight evil she created this place 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.660
 imaginary to protect it from reality 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.060
 their last illness is the disorder of 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.400
 depersonalization after all you do not see 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.500
 raven just watch her three personalities 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.630
 this happens because in every series you 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.880
 assumes a view of raven is 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.979
 demonstrating to the public that sees ie 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.050
 herself in the three personalities of 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.970
 super powerful girls the disorder 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.830
 depersonalization for those who do not know is 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.600
 characterized by the sensation of being 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 even watching on a screen 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.810
 and that is how the drawing is 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.919
 shown to us 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.140
 galera most important part 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.180
 of this theory which was the 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.850
 fact that it does psychologically 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.100
 sense and biologically it was 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.500
 written by an anonymous woman on reddit 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.150
 then it may actually be true but 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.400
 This is it folks, people are staying here. 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.620
 this was the first video of this painting 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.780
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.520
 theory really is a bit short but I 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.710
 I want you to eat, have a close one. 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.470
 theme and your criticism there for us 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.960
 Improving on the picture, beauty left here. 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.090
