00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.480
 the users and precisely now we 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.490
 they spoke in the previous presentation a 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.070
 shortly before the doctor precisely 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.350
 about infections and plants that 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.260
 can deal with them but we are going to 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.780
 try to talk a little more more to 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.280
 background of this well to defend ourselves 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.449
 against animal infections 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.949
 we have two basic strategies 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.720
 use passive barriers to prevent 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.269
 that the parasites enter the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.979
 organism and actively attack the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.989
 agencies that have been housed in 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.540
 tissues to eliminate the microorganism 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.089
 invasive the host must be able 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.699
 first to distinguish it from its own 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.640
 cells in cee can only go back to the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.010
 blood by the lymphatics if it gets blocked 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.840
 the lymphatic return the concentration 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.540
 blood protein and pressure 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760
 osmotic of the blood decrease by 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.320
 below normal and there is a 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.710
 fluid imbalance that can 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.870
 drive 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.260
 really 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.180
 the lymphatic circulation the water and 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.460
 solutes are filtered uninterrupted 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.490
 of capillary blood to the liquid 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.530
 interstitial to compensate enter the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.870
 liquid constantly to the blood from 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.730
 interstitial fluid but only 40 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.920
 percent of the liquid that leaks to 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.000
 through the capillaries he returns to them 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.530
 by osmosis of dried plants and 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.040
 we use dry plants are prepared 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.950
 between 8 and 10 grams of plant in 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.420
 infusion for a liter and a half of water and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.650
 is going to take small sips 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.210
 between a liter and a liter and a half a day and 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.659
 this will allow the fast 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 restoration and operation of 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 lymphatic system 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.579
 and therefore it will promote a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.250
 regenerative and cleansing action of 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.730
 organism cut it in the afternoon or in the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.709
 night because aloe has a kind of 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.470
 metabolism different from what the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.900
 other plants the plant performs 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.209
 photosynthesis during the night 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.659
 if we cut it in the afternoon we're going to 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.950
 removing a high degree of acidity is the same 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.950
 that the cactus for example 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.530
 and also during the afternoon it will be more 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.230
 easy that we remove a liquid that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.920
 comes out when we cut this liquid that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.010
 it comes out so called bar I do not know if it 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.380
 Take 20 days rest between 10 and 15 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.630
 days and then continue with the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.050
 treatment and that will happen with all 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.420
 the plants that have mucilages if they go 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.090
 Well, they're going to be so good that they're going to 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.750
 prevent the absorption of nutrients 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.500
 generate a protective layer at the level of 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.500
 stomach and intestines 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.980
 but we can do this because we have 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.719
 an option of plants 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.719
 so as not to depend alone
