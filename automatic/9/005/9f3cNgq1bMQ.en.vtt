00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
comes with this machine as well so you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
comes with this machine as well so you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
filled up this looks a bit fancy so you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
filled up this looks a bit fancy so you
want<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> fix<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:55.140> need<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> make<00:00:55.500> sure<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.310 
want to fix it you need to make sure you
have<00:00:55.890> no<00:00:56.070> gaps<00:00:56.370> within<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:57.030> basket<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
have no gaps within your basket so you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
have no gaps within your basket so you
just<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.250> fingers<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.609> level<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> down

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
just take your fingers and level it down

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.650 
just take your fingers and level it down
a<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.879> tamper<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
a bit like that there's a tamper with it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
a bit like that there's a tamper with it
as<00:01:03.930> well<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.700> will<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> pack

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
as well you can you will have to pack

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
as well you can you will have to pack
your<00:01:06.659> coffee<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.140> title<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
your coffee the title that that's all of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.570 
your coffee the title that that's all of
this<00:01:12.229> once<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> tamper<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:14.040> time<00:01:14.280> most

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
this once you tamper the first time most

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
this once you tamper the first time most
likely<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.420> grinds<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.930> come<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
likely the grinds will come up with the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
likely the grinds will come up with the
side<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.659> store

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
side and that's not very good one store

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.179 
side and that's not very good one store
needed<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.590> took<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> sides

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
needed so you just took the sides

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
needed so you just took the sides
everything<00:01:20.700> falls<00:01:20.909> back<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> middle<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
everything falls back in the middle and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
everything falls back in the middle and
in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> end<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.560> give<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
in the end you just give it a bit of a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
in the end you just give it a bit of a
Polish<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.930> sort<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> turn

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
Polish all you do is you sort of turn

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.800 
Polish all you do is you sort of turn
your<00:01:25.770> temper<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:27.000> ready<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
your temper and you're ready to go and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.280 
your temper and you're ready to go and
it<00:01:27.930> looks<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.820> once<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.630> water<00:01:30.869> will<00:01:31.170> go

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it looks like once the water will go

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
it looks like once the water will go
through<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:31.680> coffee<00:01:31.950> grounds<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> water

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
through these coffee grounds the water

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
through these coffee grounds the water
will<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.180> through<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.079> gaps<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.890> very

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
will go through the gaps which are very

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
will go through the gaps which are very
tight<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.729> therefore<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> water<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.780> will

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
tight so therefore the water it will

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
tight so therefore the water it will
take<00:01:37.079> away<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.950> oils<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> truth<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
take away all the oils all the truth is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.460 
take away all the oils all the truth is
all<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> goodness<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:39.930> end<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> your

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
all the goodness and will end up in your

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
all the goodness and will end up in your
cup<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> tight<00:01:42.360> package

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
cup if you don't have a tight package

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
cup if you don't have a tight package
the<00:01:43.290> gaps<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.770> between<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.369> particles<00:01:44.909> will

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the gaps in between the particles will

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
the gaps in between the particles will
be<00:01:45.149> too<00:01:45.329> great<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.840> water<00:01:46.110> most<00:01:46.710> likely

take away the sugars and the oils and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.990 
take away the sugars and the oils and
all<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> flavors<00:01:55.829> also<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> might<00:01:56.610> wonder

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
all the flavors also you might wonder

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.649 
all the flavors also you might wonder
about<00:01:57.500> how<00:01:58.500> full<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.610> seal<00:02:00.509> the

about how full you have to seal the

basket a good guideline is to once

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
basket a good guideline is to once
you've<00:02:03.570> tempted<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.530> leave<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you've tempted down to leave about a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
you've tempted down to leave about a
centimeter<00:02:05.520> gap<00:02:05.759> from<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> top<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.259> what

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
centimeter gap from the top because what

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.919 
centimeter gap from the top because what
will<00:02:07.799> happen<00:02:07.860> once<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.580> extract<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.720> copy

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
will happen once you extract or the copy

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420 
will happen once you extract or the copy
will<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.289> extracted<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
will be extracted the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.699 
will be extracted the
we<00:02:11.579> will<00:02:11.730> expand<00:02:12.180> once<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.659> water<00:02:12.870> hits<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
we will expand once the water hits the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
we will expand once the water hits the
top<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.129> therefore<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.939> need<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.269> leave<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
top and therefore you need to leave a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
top and therefore you need to leave a
little<00:02:15.659> gap<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.109> order<00:02:16.349> for<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> copper<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
little gap in order for the copper to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.599 
little gap in order for the copper to
expand<00:02:18.799> if<00:02:19.799> you're<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.010> sure<00:02:20.069> if<00:02:20.250> you've<00:02:20.519> done

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
expand if you're not sure if you've done

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.459 
expand if you're not sure if you've done
the<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:20.760> thing<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.260> don't

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
the right thing just do that you don't

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.839 
the right thing just do that you don't
have<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> mess<00:02:22.859> which<00:02:23.189> means<00:02:23.459> you've<00:02:23.609> done

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
have a mess which means you've done

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.229 
have a mess which means you've done
something<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:26.040> take<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> group<00:02:26.640> handle<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
something you take the group handle and

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.110 
something you take the group handle and
you<00:02:27.299> need<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.569> lock<00:02:27.689> it<00:02:27.870> into<00:02:28.139> the<00:02:28.859> shape<00:02:29.159> you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
you need to lock it into the shape you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.479 
you need to lock it into the shape you
do<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.359> nice<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.750> tight<00:02:30.889> all<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.189> you

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
do it nice and tight all the way so you

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.030 
do it nice and tight all the way so you
have<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.840> straight<00:02:33.840> line<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.200> 90<00:02:34.560> degree<00:02:34.859> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
have a straight line of 90 degree to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.869 
have a straight line of 90 degree to
your<00:02:35.250> steam<00:02:35.909> wand<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.980> want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.370> look<00:02:38.459> at<00:02:38.639> not

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
your steam wand you want to look at not

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.789 
your steam wand you want to look at not
quite<00:02:39.150> an<00:02:39.299> even<00:02:39.599> stream<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.170> coffee<00:02:40.379> coming

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
quite an even stream of coffee coming

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.069 
quite an even stream of coffee coming
out<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.129> it's<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.489> sort<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.849> dribbling<00:02:42.540> motion

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
out but it's a sort of dribbling motion

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.099 
out but it's a sort of dribbling motion
but<00:02:43.579> two<00:02:44.579> or<00:02:44.760> three<00:02:44.970> groups<00:02:45.239> per<00:02:45.720> second

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
but two or three groups per second

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.429 
but two or three groups per second
that's<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.889> good<00:02:47.040> way<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.329> setting<00:02:48.329> whether<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
that's a good way of setting whether you

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.360 
that's a good way of setting whether you
tempted<00:02:49.889> correctly<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:51.629> high<00:02:51.900> enough<00:02:52.370> full

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
tempted correctly and high enough full

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.089 
tempted correctly and high enough full
enough<00:02:53.609> if<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.629> realize<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.500> dripping<00:02:55.980> too

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
enough if you realize it's dripping too

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.729 
enough if you realize it's dripping too
slow<00:02:56.370> which<00:02:56.669> is<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.000> other<00:02:57.180> extreme<00:02:57.739> that

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
slow which is the other extreme that

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.940 
slow which is the other extreme that
might<00:02:58.980> mean<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.879> tempt<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.329> too<00:03:00.480> hard<00:03:00.719> or<00:03:01.019> you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
might mean you tempt it too hard or you

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.440 
might mean you tempt it too hard or you
pulled<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.370> too<00:03:02.579> much<00:03:02.609> it's<00:03:03.090> still<00:03:03.269> not

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
pulled it up too much it's still not

pulled it up too much it's still not
sure<00:03:03.659> I<00:03:03.689> want<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:03.989> check<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.799> even<00:03:05.099> more<00:03:05.280> you

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
sure I want to check on it even more you

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.000 
sure I want to check on it even more you
just<00:03:05.969> knock<00:03:06.480> out<00:03:06.659> your<00:03:06.840> cookie<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.379> your<00:03:07.439> table

just knock out your cookie on your table

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.920 
just knock out your cookie on your table
and<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.250> then<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.879> says<00:03:09.060> if<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.389> comes<00:03:09.599> out<00:03:09.750> of

and you then it says if it comes out of

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.259 
and you then it says if it comes out of
one<00:03:10.079> piece<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:10.680> your<00:03:11.129> basket<00:03:11.669> looks<00:03:11.849> nice<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
clean beautiful that's join the mad you

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.949 
clean beautiful that's join the mad you
want<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.079> put<00:03:16.229> there<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.940> protect<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.599> auto

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
want to put there to protect the auto

because<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.879> have<00:03:23.879> a<00:03:23.909> perfect<00:03:24.150> extraction

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
because if you have a perfect extraction

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.629 
because if you have a perfect extraction
and<00:03:25.019> your<00:03:25.319> cromer<00:03:25.560> comes<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:26.040> beautiful<00:03:26.459> which

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
and your cromer comes on beautiful which

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.509 
and your cromer comes on beautiful which
essentially<00:03:27.120> are<00:03:27.419> little<00:03:27.780> tiny<00:03:27.959> bubbles<00:03:28.519> of

essentially are little tiny bubbles of

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.309 
essentially are little tiny bubbles of
sugars<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.389> oils<00:03:32.629> so<00:03:33.629> if<00:03:33.750> they<00:03:33.959> would<00:03:34.139> hit<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
sugars and oils so if they would hit a

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.960 
sugars and oils so if they would hit a
really<00:03:34.560> really<00:03:34.799> hot<00:03:35.010> cup<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.459> bubbles<00:03:35.819> would

really really hot cup the bubbles would

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.300 
really really hot cup the bubbles would
burst<00:03:36.180> straight<00:03:36.810> away<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.889> it's<00:03:38.040> only

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
burst straight away but if it's only

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.729 
burst straight away but if it's only
just<00:03:38.549> one<00:03:38.819> which<00:03:39.209> that's<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.259> you<00:03:40.439> have<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
just one which that's what you have the

just one which that's what you have the
met<00:03:40.919> for<00:03:41.189> your<00:03:41.669> chroma<00:03:41.939> will<00:03:42.209> stay<00:03:42.659> there<00:03:42.870> for

met for your chroma will stay there for

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.659 
met for your chroma will stay there for
much<00:03:43.229> much<00:03:43.470> longer<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:44.069> therefore<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.489> will

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
much much longer and therefore you will

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.710 
much much longer and therefore you will
have<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.819> much<00:03:45.030> nicer<00:03:45.329> cooking<00:03:45.870> with

crema<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.920> basically<00:03:48.920> tiny<00:03:49.310> little<00:03:49.700> bubbles

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
crema is basically tiny little bubbles

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.509 
crema is basically tiny little bubbles
which<00:03:50.900> are<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.260> tiny<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.739> can't<00:03:51.860> actually<00:03:52.190> see

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
which are so tiny you can't actually see

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.610 
which are so tiny you can't actually see
the<00:03:52.640> bubbles<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:53.239> looks<00:03:53.450> like<00:03:53.540> creamy<00:03:54.200> sort<00:03:54.500> of

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the bubbles it looks like creamy sort of

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.720 
the bubbles it looks like creamy sort of
rich<00:03:55.430> brown<00:03:55.879> honey<00:03:56.360> like<00:03:56.660> red<00:03:57.050> brownish

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
rich brown honey like red brownish

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.670 
rich brown honey like red brownish
liquid<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.879> mention<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.420> word<00:03:59.569> honey<00:03:59.840> because

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
liquid I mention the word honey because

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.500 
liquid I mention the word honey because
it<00:04:00.830> actually<00:04:01.010> resembles<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.819> consistency<00:04:02.480> of

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
it actually resembles the consistency of

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.229 
it actually resembles the consistency of
honey<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.080> so<00:04:04.069> once<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.580> achieve<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:05.060> you

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
honey and so once you achieve that you

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.920 
honey and so once you achieve that you
know<00:04:05.390> you've<00:04:05.989> got<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.200> good<00:04:06.349> extraction
