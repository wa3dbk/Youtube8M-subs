where I just did not care like I don't

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.460 
where I just did not care like I don't
have<00:04:02.730> time<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.660> don't<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.989> time<00:04:04.230> to

something<00:04:06.420> else<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.769> think<00:04:08.370> maybe<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.269> max

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
something else and I think maybe the max

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.840 
something else and I think maybe the max
would<00:04:10.470> be<00:04:10.650> when<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.220> had<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.610> longest

would be when I had the longest

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.280 
would be when I had the longest
relationship<00:04:13.760> maybe<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.090> month<00:04:15.570> I'll<00:04:15.959> say
