control also the quad face technology on
this<00:00:53.820> particular<00:00:54.030> rack<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> inner<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this particular rack is the inner and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.310 
this particular rack is the inner and
outer<00:00:55.829> quad<00:00:56.220> face<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.450> this<00:00:57.630> basically<00:00:58.020> does

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
outer quad face but this basically does

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
outer quad face but this basically does
is<00:00:58.500> stretches<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.489> screen<00:00:59.790> bed<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> makes<00:01:00.510> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
is stretches the screen bed and makes it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.050 
is stretches the screen bed and makes it
longer<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.590> provides<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.160> larger<00:01:02.520> sweet<00:01:02.760> spot

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
longer so provides a larger sweet spot

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.780 
longer so provides a larger sweet spot
to<00:01:03.600> create<00:01:03.930> less<00:01:04.140> vibration<00:01:04.620> and<00:01:05.070> more<00:01:05.519> power

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to create less vibration and more power

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
to create less vibration and more power
the<00:01:06.780> other<00:01:06.930> two<00:01:07.170> technologies<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.890> racket<00:01:08.310> has

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the other two technologies in racket has

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
the other two technologies in racket has
is<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> control<00:01:09.360> ring<00:01:09.570> technology<00:01:10.290> which

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is the control ring technology which

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.340 
is the control ring technology which
helps<00:01:11.520> reduce<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> string<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> formation

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
helps reduce the string the formation

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.290 
helps reduce the string the formation
and<00:01:13.650> also<00:01:14.070> multi-zone<00:01:14.430> grip<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.120> is<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
and also multi-zone grip which is a

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.030 
and also multi-zone grip which is a
smooth<00:01:15.630> grip<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.049> offers<00:01:16.409> greater<00:01:16.710> comfort

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
smooth grip that offers greater comfort

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.270 
smooth grip that offers greater comfort
and<00:01:17.430> sweat<00:01:18.120> absorption<00:01:18.540> during<00:01:19.080> gameplay<00:01:19.320> the
