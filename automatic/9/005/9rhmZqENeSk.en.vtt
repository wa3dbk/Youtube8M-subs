00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
flying reptiles such as Pteranodons but

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.960 
flying reptiles such as Pteranodons but
I'm<00:01:52.200> sure<00:01:52.440> we'll<00:01:52.709> see<00:01:52.890> them<00:01:53.069> very<00:01:53.220> shortly<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
I'm sure we'll see them very shortly I

I'm sure we'll see them very shortly I
was<00:01:54.209> not<00:01:54.390> expecting<00:01:54.659> anything<00:01:55.259> even<00:01:55.770> close<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
was not expecting anything even close to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.850 
was not expecting anything even close to
completion<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.720> if<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.080> isn't<00:01:58.500> even<00:01:58.619> close

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
completion and if this isn't even close

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.749 
completion and if this isn't even close
to<00:01:58.979> being<00:01:59.130> completed

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
to being completed

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.230 
to being completed
I<00:01:59.880> honestly<00:02:00.750> hunt<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.740> hard<00:02:02.039> can't<00:02:02.820> wait<00:02:03.030> for

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I honestly hunt on hard can't wait for

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
I honestly hunt on hard can't wait for
it<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> done<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> gameplay<00:02:04.619> there

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it to be done as for the gameplay there

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.100 
it to be done as for the gameplay there
is<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> pick<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:05.850> contractor<00:02:06.450> page<00:02:06.659> which

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
is a pick your contractor page which

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.870 
is a pick your contractor page which
will<00:02:07.259> probably<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.619> first<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.549> you'll<00:02:08.670> do

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
will probably be first thing you'll do

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.699 
will probably be first thing you'll do
when<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.179> make<00:02:09.329> a<00:02:09.360> new<00:02:09.420> game<00:02:09.720> each<00:02:10.079> one<00:02:10.410> comes

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
when you make a new game each one comes

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.289 
when you make a new game each one comes
with<00:02:10.950> its<00:02:11.070> own<00:02:11.160> disadvantages<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
with its own disadvantages and

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.000 
with its own disadvantages and
advantages<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:13.109> of<00:02:13.230> course<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.709> game<00:02:13.859> is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
advantages but of course the game is

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.130 
advantages but of course the game is
still<00:02:14.190> under<00:02:14.489> development<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> couldn't

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
still under development so I couldn't

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.170 
still under development so I couldn't
access<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.650> actual<00:02:16.980> gameplay<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.910> guys
