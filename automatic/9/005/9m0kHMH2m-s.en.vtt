 hello how about I'm lupita and this is my 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.840
 channel the lupita recipes the day of 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.290
 Today I'm going to show you how to prepare 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.410
 mass to make some delicious quesadillas 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.140
 We are going to need 2 cups of flour 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 corn 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:51.649
 a cup of wheat flour 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.649
 two cups of warm water and a little salt 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.670
 to start making our dough I go 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.449
 to put the flour in my mold or in my 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.449
 refractory 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.140
 since we put our flour I'm going to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.140
 add salt 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.090
 now I'm going to start adding the water 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.090
 tibia 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.010
 and with clean hands we will begin to 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.010
 knead 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.950
 let's go adding little water in 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.950
 little bit 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.900
 to 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.840
 and here we have our mass ready 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.690
 this is how we stayed 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.090
 it is more to us we can occupy it already 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.090

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.010
