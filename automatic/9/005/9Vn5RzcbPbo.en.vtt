brush it's also cleaned just around the
edge<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.940> get<00:02:57.060> rid<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.239> any<00:02:57.390> kind<00:02:57.630> of

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
there for a while and kind of making it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.229 
there for a while and kind of making it
look<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.350> little<00:03:01.530> bit<00:03:01.620> flaky<00:03:01.950> or<00:03:02.250> peel<00:03:02.670> off<00:03:02.910> so

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
look a little bit flaky or peel off so

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.729 
look a little bit flaky or peel off so
I'm<00:03:03.299> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> start<00:03:03.750> by<00:03:03.930> using<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.620> brush

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
I'm going to start by using the brush

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.020 
I'm going to start by using the brush
that<00:03:05.010> came<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.489> because<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:05.940> little

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
that came in it because it's a little

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.880 
that came in it because it's a little
bit<00:03:06.180> fuller<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.959> I'm<00:03:07.260> going<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> use<00:03:07.650> for<00:03:07.860> a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
bit fuller this I'm going to use for a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.650 
bit fuller this I'm going to use for a
detail<00:03:08.280> work<00:03:08.489> at<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> end<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.450> you're<00:03:09.540> going

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
detail work at the end so you're going

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.330 
detail work at the end so you're going
to<00:03:09.720> start<00:03:09.959> by<00:03:10.049> taking<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.590> little<00:03:10.680> bit<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.920> fresh

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
to start by taking a little bit of fresh

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.250 
to start by taking a little bit of fresh
mascara<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.390> all<00:03:12.510> fresh<00:03:12.780> now<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
mascara so it's all fresh now that the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.020 
mascara so it's all fresh now that the
brush<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.560> cleaned<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.069> you're<00:03:14.640> gonna<00:03:14.760> start

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
brush is cleaned and you're gonna start

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.210 
brush is cleaned and you're gonna start
by<00:03:15.239> wiggling<00:03:15.870> right<00:03:16.109> at<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.350> root<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.739> then

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
by wiggling right at the root and then

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220 
by wiggling right at the root and then
pulling<00:03:17.549> through<00:03:18.120> go<00:03:18.420> right<00:03:18.630> at<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> root<00:03:19.079> I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
pulling through go right at the root I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.930 
pulling through go right at the root I
tend<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.590> look<00:03:19.739> down<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.459> get<00:03:20.640> right<00:03:20.790> at

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
tend to look down so you get right at

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.599 
tend to look down so you get right at
the<00:03:21.030> root<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:23.070> pull

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
the root and then you can just pull

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.580 
the root and then you can just pull
through<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:26.810> lot<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.840> people<00:03:27.989> say<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.320> they'll

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
through a lot of people say that they'll

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
through a lot of people say that they'll
apply<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.829> few<00:03:29.280> coats<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.730> mascara<00:03:29.850> what<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
apply a few coats of mascara what do you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.420 
apply a few coats of mascara what do you
mean<00:03:30.930> by<00:03:31.079> coats<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.769> they<00:03:31.890> will<00:03:32.040> put<00:03:32.220> one

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
mean by coats is that they will put one

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.430 
mean by coats is that they will put one
layer<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.630> they<00:03:34.109> will<00:03:34.260> let

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
layer on like we just have they will let

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.080 
layer on like we just have they will let
it<00:03:34.590> dry<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.130> they<00:03:35.340> will<00:03:35.489> come<00:03:35.670> back<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.000> do

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
it dry and they will come back and do

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.789 
it dry and they will come back and do
another<00:03:36.299> one<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.959> will<00:03:37.170> prevent<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.739> from

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
another one that will prevent it from

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.490 
another one that will prevent it from
looking<00:03:38.340> kind<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.940> overdone<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:40.320> there's

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
looking kind of overdone on that there's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.229 
looking kind of overdone on that there's
too<00:03:40.680> much<00:03:40.859> heaviness<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.760> actual<00:03:42.090> last

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
too much heaviness on the actual last

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.020 
too much heaviness on the actual last
formulas<00:03:42.900> typically<00:03:43.650> give<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> longer<00:03:44.579> curled

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
formulas typically give a longer curled

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.610 
formulas typically give a longer curled
so<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.510> why<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:45.959> kind<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.170> handy<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.590> use

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
so that is why it's kind of handy to use

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.440 
so that is why it's kind of handy to use
this<00:03:46.980> first<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.519> all<00:03:47.609> even<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> don't<00:03:48.329> like

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
this first of all even if you don't like

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
this first of all even if you don't like
waterproof<00:03:48.900> kind<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.590> formulas<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.370> can

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
waterproof kind of formulas you can

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.460 
waterproof kind of formulas you can
apply<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:50.790> first<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.390> all<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.690> then<00:03:52.140> apply

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
apply this first of all and then apply

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.319 
apply this first of all and then apply
your<00:03:52.500> now<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.100> side<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.640> dry<00:03:53.850> I'm<00:03:54.209> going

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
your now that this side is dry I'm going

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.319 
your now that this side is dry I'm going
to<00:03:54.420> take<00:03:54.569> another<00:03:54.959> coat<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.530> it

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
to take another coat of it

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.610 
to take another coat of it
remembering<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.600> little<00:03:58.170> bit<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.410> wiggle

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
remembering to a little bit of a wiggle

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.610 
remembering to a little bit of a wiggle
to<00:03:59.459> separate<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.359> lashes<00:04:00.540> out<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.200> then<00:04:01.380> pull

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
to separate the lashes out and then pull

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620 
to separate the lashes out and then pull
right<00:04:01.890> through<00:04:01.950> when<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.489> take<00:04:02.760> my<00:04:03.060> other<00:04:03.269> brush

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
right through when I take my other brush

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.509 
right through when I take my other brush
just<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.230> do<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.380> little<00:04:04.470> bit<00:04:04.769> more<00:04:04.920> detail<00:04:05.250> work

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
just to do a little bit more detail work

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.640 
just to do a little bit more detail work
I'm<00:04:06.120> going<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.359> put<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.630> into<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.230> one<00:04:07.380> again

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
I'm going to put it into that one again

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.080 
I'm going to put it into that one again
just<00:04:07.709> work<00:04:08.370> on<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.819> outer<00:04:09.000> part<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.569> my<00:04:09.630> eyes

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
just work on the outer part of my eyes

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.539 
just work on the outer part of my eyes
and<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.470> inner<00:04:13.650> part<00:04:14.010> as<00:04:14.100> well<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:17.400> can

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and to the inner part as well you can

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.089 
and to the inner part as well you can
also<00:04:17.700> do<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.150> underneath<00:04:19.010> but<00:04:20.010> you

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
also do this underneath but you

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.890 
also do this underneath but you
typically<00:04:20.640> want<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.909> do<00:04:21.060> underneath<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.750> will

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
typically want to do underneath I will

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.680 
typically want to do underneath I will
keep<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.200> right<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
keep it right up to the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.180 
keep it right up to the
because<00:04:24.200> what<00:04:24.350> you<00:04:24.410> don't<00:04:24.530> want<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.920> kind<00:04:25.130> of

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
because what you don't want is kind of

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.830 
because what you don't want is kind of
spider<00:04:25.460> eyes<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.030> bringing<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.450> all<00:04:26.660> the
