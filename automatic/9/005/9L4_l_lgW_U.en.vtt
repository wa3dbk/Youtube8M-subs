00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.360
 complete and five 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.080
 very good to all I'm the one who believes that and 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.610
 well this time I bring you a video is going to 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.799
 being pretty short is simply for 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.720
 all those who are in the custom 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.239
 firmware 450 455 ita and the arrivals 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.939
 keep saying about the error that 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.529
 you have to update and well I know that 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.810
 there seems it could be seen tired you will see 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.249
 the putt but he has not been able to raise the 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.710
 video before simply because of 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.350
 that was costing me because render 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.360
 the rest but well I'm just going to 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.000
 leave a pkg file in the description 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.329
 is a let's say a gene in speak and 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.519
 revisable 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.159
 to install and uninstall what is 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.510
 he put them and well this we have done I go 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.570
 angelillo vale is either totally 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.460
 ours and nothing simply that for 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.850
 install it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.260
 put the pkg file in one in a usb 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 install jce open what is the program 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.890
 and automatically detect if you are in 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.040
 3-d forgiveness in 450 or 4.55 of hita 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.720
 once it has been detected you give it a 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.060
 click and gives you the option to activate or 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.369
 deactivate then good the good thing that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.229
 has to the spurs that I seen that 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.510
 Manually, they do not let you 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.630
 then deactivate it then if 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 someone wants after a reale ar or 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.200
 even when they take out a new version 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.790
 climb I always recommend where there is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.580
 lÃ£deres puff 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.990
 and then good with this box that we have 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.180
 done with this little application then 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.750
 we give you the possibility to activate and 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.410
 disable and nothing simply this you 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.430
 I leave here with the rest of the video that 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.500
 well I want to say before anything else 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.480
 that some plays takes a little 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.220
 install I do not know why in it to me in 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.010
 concrete takes a long time for that fact a 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.050
 small video cut but the normal thing is 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.000
 that you do not have to be late, well, since I'm 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.060
 I'll explain a little bit and once 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
 you have opened him you say to the message 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.080
 yes yes once I finish doing 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.210
 all of them will ask that if he wanted 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880
 restart the system and it will give you the option 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.950
 to do a full reset a semi 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.010
 restart and you do the one that you 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.340
 ye better place and nothing is 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.790
 Restart I have tried several plays 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.400
 no brick nothing no problem 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.680
 all forms as it is always said in 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.310
 it's good that you use it under our 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.030
 responsibility and nothing here you will see 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.160
 that you are already perfectly at 4.6 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.500
 and nothing else I hope you like to comment 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 to see if you are doing well and obtained with 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.840
 problem and nothing are in the next
