something<00:04:30.540> 160<00:04:31.320> something<00:04:31.620> ones

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
something 160 something ones

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.070 
something 160 something ones
80-something<00:04:32.550> ones<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.120> there's<00:04:33.390> also<00:04:33.540> I

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
80-something ones and there's also I

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.010

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
believe level 1 30 ones just stick to

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.690 
believe level 1 30 ones just stick to
the<00:04:37.050> lower<00:04:37.440> level<00:04:37.830> ones<00:04:38.010> there's<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.490> no

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
the lower level ones there's really no

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.690 
the lower level ones there's really no
point<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.270> up<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.690> level<00:04:39.810> 1<00:04:40.080> 30<00:04:40.350> s

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
point in going up to the level 1 30 s

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.040 
point in going up to the level 1 30 s
it's<00:04:41.700> really<00:04:42.030> just<00:04:42.210> not<00:04:42.390> even<00:04:42.540> worth<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> time

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
it's really just not even worth the time

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.080 
it's really just not even worth the time
and<00:04:43.110> effort<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:44.130> just<00:04:44.430> go<00:04:44.550> ahead<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.790> attack

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
protect from range you can hold it on a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.780 
protect from range you can hold it on a
few<00:05:16.320> one<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.500> flick<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.520> don't<00:05:17.610> have

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
few one I flick it so that I don't have

basically<00:05:24.810> when<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:24.960> kill<00:05:25.290> them<00:05:25.470> they<00:05:25.680> will

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
basically when you kill them they will

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.410 
basically when you kill them they will
drop<00:05:26.100> adamant<00:05:26.730> bars<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.360> stacks<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.530> four<00:05:28.830> and

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
drop adamant bars in stacks of four and

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.440 
drop adamant bars in stacks of four and
they<00:05:30.420> drop<00:05:30.750> them<00:05:30.900> every<00:05:31.230> one<00:05:31.710> in<00:05:31.860> for

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
they drop them every one in for

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.540 
they drop them every one in for
approximately<00:05:33.450> but<00:05:34.200> I've<00:05:34.470> gone<00:05:34.770> where<00:05:35.400> I've

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
approximately but I've gone where I've

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.090 
approximately but I've gone where I've
had<00:05:35.790> I've<00:05:36.300> killed<00:05:36.870> i<00:05:37.050> think<00:05:37.230> it<00:05:37.320> was<00:05:37.380> 24<00:05:37.950> of

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
had I've killed i think it was 24 of

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.740 
had I've killed i think it was 24 of
them<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.550> they<00:05:38.669> didn't<00:05:38.940> drop<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> single<00:05:39.450> bar

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
them and they didn't drop a single bar

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.350 
them and they didn't drop a single bar
and<00:05:40.020> I<00:05:40.980> killed<00:05:41.370> four<00:05:41.850> of<00:05:41.880> them<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.150> they

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
and I killed four of them and they

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.630 
and I killed four of them and they
dropped<00:05:42.720> for<00:05:43.200> four<00:05:43.890> in<00:05:43.980> a<00:05:44.010> row<00:05:44.190> actually

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
dropped for four in a row actually

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.210 
dropped for four in a row actually
dropped<00:05:44.850> bars<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:45.419> it's<00:05:45.690> really<00:05:45.990> it's<00:05:46.860> kind<00:05:47.100> of

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
dropped bars so it's really it's kind of

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.159 
dropped bars so it's really it's kind of
back<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.550> forth<00:05:47.640> but<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.330> average<00:05:48.540> it's<00:05:48.960> one

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
back and forth but on average it's one

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.460 
back and forth but on average it's one
in<00:05:49.290> four<00:05:49.530> drops<00:05:49.890> four<00:05:50.250> bars<00:05:50.520> and<00:05:50.880> so<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:51.930> got<00:05:52.440> on

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
in four drops four bars and so I got on

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
in four drops four bars and so I got on
my<00:05:52.650> first<00:05:52.860> try<00:05:53.100> right<00:05:53.310> here<00:05:53.340> for<00:05:53.910> bars<00:05:54.180> one

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
my first try right here for bars one

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.010 
my first try right here for bars one
accumulator<00:05:56.490> drop<00:05:56.880> down<00:05:58.669> 1<00:05:59.669> 2<00:05:59.880> 3<00:06:00.000> 4<00:06:00.240> as<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:00.870> can

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
accumulator drop down 1 2 3 4 as you can

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.430 
accumulator drop down 1 2 3 4 as you can
see<00:06:01.200> there<00:06:02.570> so<00:06:03.570> basically<00:06:03.990> that's<00:06:04.140> all<00:06:04.350> you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
see there so basically that's all you

see there so basically that's all you
got<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:04.680> do<00:06:04.800> is<00:06:04.830> just<00:06:05.100> kill<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.400> bee<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.730> sees

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
got to do is just kill a bee and sees

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.690 
got to do is just kill a bee and sees

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.760 
spots yeah yeah doing math twenty six
spots<00:06:55.199> that<00:06:56.199> is<00:06:56.380> equal<00:06:56.770> to<00:06:56.800> i<00:06:57.580> believe<00:06:58.770> 8080

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
spots that is equal to i believe 8080

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.260 
spots that is equal to i believe 8080
3000<00:07:00.610> GP<00:07:00.940> and<00:07:01.180> then<00:07:02.550> trips<00:07:03.550> take<00:07:03.759> about<00:07:03.970> ten

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
3000 GP and then trips take about ten

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.120 
3000 GP and then trips take about ten
minutes<00:07:04.300> they<00:07:05.110> can<00:07:05.259> take<00:07:05.440> in<00:07:05.560> order<00:07:05.680> like<00:07:05.860> nine

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
minutes they can take in order like nine

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.189 
minutes they can take in order like nine
to<00:07:06.310> fifteen<00:07:06.669> minutes<00:07:07.030> so<00:07:07.570> I<00:07:07.630> just<00:07:07.660> put<00:07:07.870> 10

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
to fifteen minutes so I just put 10

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.890 
to fifteen minutes so I just put 10
minutes<00:07:08.500> and<00:07:08.740> there's<00:07:09.160> 10<00:07:09.460> min<00:07:09.699> there's<00:07:09.900> six

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
minutes and there's 10 min there's six

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.719 
minutes and there's 10 min there's six
times<00:07:11.169> ten<00:07:11.289> minutes<00:07:11.680> and<00:07:11.770> hours<00:07:11.949> so<00:07:12.340> multiply

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
times ten minutes and hours so multiply

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.980 
times ten minutes and hours so multiply
that<00:07:12.880> by<00:07:12.940> six<00:07:14.610> and<00:07:15.610> that<00:07:16.090> will<00:07:16.300> give<00:07:16.449> you<00:07:16.660> four

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
that by six and that will give you four

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.589 
that by six and that will give you four
hundred<00:07:17.289> ninety<00:07:17.320> nine<00:07:17.740> thousand<00:07:18.340> GP<00:07:18.789> which<00:07:19.360> is

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599
