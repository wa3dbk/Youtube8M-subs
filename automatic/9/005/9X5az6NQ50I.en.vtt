at camera hi I'm here and regard today
with<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.680> dynamic<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:28.220> 10<00:00:28.520> with<00:00:28.730> retracts<00:00:29.210> yes

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
with a dynamic a 10 with retracts yes

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.570 
with a dynamic a 10 with retracts yes
they<00:00:30.230> finally<00:00:30.560> came<00:00:30.710> out<00:00:30.770> with<00:00:31.070> it<00:00:31.190> and<00:00:31.220> we

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
they finally came out with it and we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.710 
they finally came out with it and we
decided<00:00:31.880> we're<00:00:32.029> gonna<00:00:32.180> sell<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.480> why<00:00:32.690> not

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
decided we're gonna sell it why not

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.690 
decided we're gonna sell it why not
because<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.650> dynamite<00:00:34.340> end<00:00:34.550> without

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
because the dynamite end without

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.729 
because the dynamite end without
retracts<00:00:35.330> is<00:00:35.570> one<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.900> my<00:00:36.050> favorite<00:00:36.500> hand

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
retracts is one of my favorite hand

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.979 
retracts is one of my favorite hand
launch<00:00:37.040> plans<00:00:37.370> will<00:00:38.120> drink<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.540> hand<00:00:38.750> launch

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
launch plans will drink it a hand launch

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.470 
launch plans will drink it a hand launch
but<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:39.530> not<00:00:39.739> really<00:00:40.250> impossible<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.420> do

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
but it's not really impossible so I do

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.510 
but it's not really impossible so I do
it<00:00:41.720> I'm<00:00:42.230> kind<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.650> expecting<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.250> this<00:00:43.400> will

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
it I'm kind of expecting that this will

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.150 
it I'm kind of expecting that this will
be<00:00:43.640> flying<00:00:43.910> pretty<00:00:44.420> much<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.840> same<00:00:45.050> way<00:00:45.320> well

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
be flying pretty much the same way well

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.729 
be flying pretty much the same way well
most<00:00:46.820> of<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.480> fuselage<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:48.290> wings<00:00:48.530> and

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
most of the fuselage and wings and

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.590 
most of the fuselage and wings and
everything<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.610> same<00:00:49.879> as<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.330> old<00:00:50.420> one

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
everything are the same as the old one

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.229 
everything are the same as the old one
so<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.530> did<00:00:51.710> change<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.340> design<00:00:52.489> of<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.030> crash

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
so we did change the design of the crash

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.410 
so we did change the design of the crash
proofing<00:00:53.600> kit<00:00:53.840> because<00:00:54.380> we<00:00:54.950> could<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:56.180> will

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
proofing kit because we could this will

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.950 
proofing kit because we could this will
absorb<00:00:56.780> damage<00:00:57.710> as<00:00:58.340> it<00:00:58.730> were<00:00:58.940> because<00:00:59.180> this

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
absorb damage as it were because this

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.720 
absorb damage as it were because this
happens<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.380> be<00:01:00.470> one<00:01:00.649> of<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.829> very<00:01:01.040> good<00:01:01.310> crash

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
happens to be one of the very good crash

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.840 
happens to be one of the very good crash
proofing<00:01:02.090> designs<00:01:02.420> with<00:01:02.720> rods<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.290> run

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
proofing designs with rods that run

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.650

where<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.000> rod<00:01:05.119> speed

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
where the rod speed

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.480 
where the rod speed

all this huge es seasoned here two of
them<00:01:51.349> bundled<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.860> together<00:01:52.099> creating<00:01:52.849> loads

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
them bundled up together creating loads

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.930 
them bundled up together creating loads
of<00:01:53.720> heat<00:01:54.220> batteries<00:01:55.220> in<00:01:55.399> there<00:01:55.550> too

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
of heat batteries in there too

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.120 
of heat batteries in there too
also<00:01:56.240> creating<00:01:56.630> Heat<00:01:56.990> why<00:01:57.649> are<00:01:57.709> there<00:01:57.950> no

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
also creating Heat why are there no

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.740 
also creating Heat why are there no
vents<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.640> don't<00:01:58.910> know<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.179> we<00:01:59.270> put<00:01:59.450> one<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.690> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
vents I don't know so we put one in the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.169 
vents I don't know so we put one in the
wheel<00:01:59.899> well<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.200> here<00:02:00.920> that's<00:02:01.160> an<00:02:01.369> intakes<00:02:01.910> and

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
wheel well to here that's an intakes and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.449 
wheel well to here that's an intakes and
an<00:02:02.300> exhaust<00:02:02.599> over<00:02:02.899> here<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.500> we're<00:02:04.069> gonna<00:02:04.190> cool

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
an exhaust over here so we're gonna cool

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.400 
an exhaust over here so we're gonna cool
that<00:02:04.729> stuff<00:02:05.060> down<00:02:05.300> cool<00:02:05.690> your<00:02:05.840> pits<00:02:06.080> your

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
that stuff down cool your pits your

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.250 
that stuff down cool your pits your
cockpit<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.360> did<00:02:11.480> some<00:02:11.630> pretty<00:02:11.720> flying<00:02:12.020> on

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
cockpit so we did some pretty flying on

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.770 
cockpit so we did some pretty flying on
this<00:02:12.349> plane<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:12.830> use<00:02:12.980> some<00:02:13.520> HDPE<00:02:14.090> plastic<00:02:14.209> and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
this plane we use some HDPE plastic and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.530 
this plane we use some HDPE plastic and
covered<00:02:15.170> over<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.410> wheel<00:02:15.770> bases<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
covered over the wheel bases and the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.870 
covered over the wheel bases and the
servos<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.770> wires<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.459> all<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.700> other

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
servos and the wires and all this other

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.370 
servos and the wires and all this other
stuff<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.270> also<00:02:20.450> made<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.930> lot<00:02:21.080> stronger

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
stuff and also made it a lot stronger

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.220 
stuff and also made it a lot stronger
here<00:02:21.709> where<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.980> rods<00:02:22.190> end

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
here where the rods end

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.470 
here where the rods end
so<00:02:23.500> if<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.370> pull<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> wing<00:02:24.910> up<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.270> rods

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
so if you pull the wing up the rods

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.180 
so if you pull the wing up the rods
gonna<00:02:25.780> want<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.110> press<00:02:26.349> down<00:02:26.379> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.770> phone<00:02:27.010> we

it I see that the motor is to die
running<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.310> no<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.700> wasn't<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.210> doesn't<00:04:57.540> do

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
running it no it wasn't it doesn't do

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.670 
running it no it wasn't it doesn't do
that<00:04:57.780> when<00:04:57.930> you're<00:04:58.050> running<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.290> power<00:04:58.530> you

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
that when you're running a power you

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.140 
that when you're running a power you
still<00:04:58.860> have<00:04:58.980> control<00:04:59.130> over<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.640> plane<00:04:59.850> in<00:05:00.030> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
still have control over the plane in it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.060 
still have control over the plane in it
and<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.450> voters<00:05:00.810> slow<00:05:01.200> down<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:01.740> don't<00:05:01.860> just

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070
