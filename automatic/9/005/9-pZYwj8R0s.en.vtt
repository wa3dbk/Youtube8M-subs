00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.100
 then in a bowl we throw 3 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.000
 eggs and sugar we beat them 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.750

 and we beat it until it is foamy 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.550
 then add a natural yogurt 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.810
 Oil 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.880
 you can also use the oil 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.880
 vegetable that you like 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.369
 then adding cocoa 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.440
 we throw a quantity first 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.400
 I have a lot left 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.230
 and then we throw the rest 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.940
 posters 8 we use the one that finished the 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.420
 past that does not carry sugars if it is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.420
 well kept 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 once we have it mixed we go with the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.040
 flour in a sieve adonis amos harina 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.040
 and the yeast 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.100
 and we mix it and we're sieving it 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.700
 we will continue mixing with the help of a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.789
 spatula 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.350
 we throw a quantity and mix and 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.829
 we return to take the amount and we return 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.829
 to mix 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.260
 well here we have it this is the point 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.180
 now we throw it in a mold 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.270
 to unmold the best we have covered 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.210
 the mold with baking paper as the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.230
 paper you deserve a little bit the source 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.780
 we put the fountain in the middle of 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.250
 oven and bake at 180 degrees during 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.250
 about 30 to 35 minutes 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.719
 [Music] 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.340
 [Music]

 30 minutes have passed and we will see how 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.480
 is clicked in the center and if the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.910
 skewer comes out clean means you're 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.620
 cooked therefore we remove 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.500
 otherwise we would leave another 5 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.489
 minutes more and here we have it now 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.489
 let it cool 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.099
 and back them up super easy we 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.330
 we lift up the paper and place it 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.530
 on a grid 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.990
 we separate the edges 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 and we take off the paper from the fixed background 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.530
 what good comes out 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.530
 and we divide it into rations 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.550
