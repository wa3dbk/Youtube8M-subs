00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.590
 Hello 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 wants 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.789
 you are all here that I saw flames and 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.610
 knights bringing them the beginning of 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.099
 a new series here in the channel people 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.009
 that's how it's going to be bringing my 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.470
 list my weapons wishes for the 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.660
 next call of duty the weapons that I 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.630
 like to see in the next hard heat 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.640
 and expensive that of course this is extremely 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.320
 my opinion I know that maybe you 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.960
 because this disagreement with the weapons that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.879
 we are going to be reviewing but but 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.640
 I'll be giving you the statistics 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.190
 the stories real life images 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.019
 of these weapons no and because you already 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.010
 you will say what you think, and to begin with 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.269
 here as they are watching on screen 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 we are using the boom of black ops 1 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:59.229
 one of my favorite weapons of the game that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.890
 by strange way this weapon I liked 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.290
 quite is not it is a little weird this weapon 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.060
 itself the way it's built 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.130
 the way he shoots the way in 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.900
 that kills was a little weird so for 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.030
 we're going to start with this weapon, let's go 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.409
 to review the history as it was done and 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 all roy horita I will be giving them 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.440
 a little bit of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.330
 basically the history as I was 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.360
 saying of this weapon so we're going to 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.360
 start not this weapon people was generated 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.570
 in austria by colonel walter is 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.550
 troll the law was framed within 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.010
 of a program also directed by this 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.650
 military that sought to renew totally 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.560
 the portable armament of the army of his 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.110
 country one of the things that was sought was 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 achieve a small weapon like that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.430
 quickly discarded 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.410
 options that included folding stock or 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.060
 extendable was required that a 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.250
 configuration that would make the weapon 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.130
 always whether it was compact or not 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.420
 ready to shoot was so I took 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.060
 to the decision to integrate the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.009
 components in a bulb design where the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.810
 shot systems were introduced in 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.460
 the butt that's why this gun has 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.040
 so big what the butt is not 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.030
 It's a little weird like I told you in 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.580
 tirana previously quickly urges 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.890
 to that was acquiring a configuration 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.260
 very strange by the standards of the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.600
 departing from everything known what 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.640
 it was quite different maybe the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.400
 most innovative concept was what 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.900
 to look not only for a sub-machine gun but 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.270
 a whole family of weapons 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.450
 while believing himself creating this weapon he 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.819
 they realized that maybe they were 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.970
 basically finding everything at a 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.680
 new generation of assault weapons not and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.100
 Well that's the way it was not already there 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.350
 attempts to achieve is this same type 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.240
 of weapon during the 20th century but never 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.450
 with firm conviction the sixth result 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.550
 there are successful rifles existed with 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.350
 carbine versions or carbine pistols 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.480
 or similar but at this moment it 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.480
 he thought of a new concept the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.239
 modularity this is to design a system 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.340
 of weapons complete whose greater amount of 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.470
 components be interchangeable with each other 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.820
 and that can be replaced without further 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.880
 problems and without the use of tools 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.709
 special modules that allow 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.670
 turn the future into anything 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.140
 of water 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.470
 finally minds after several years 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.900
 of work and design and trials the boom 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.420
 passed all the tests in austria was 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.950
 declared a regulation rifle 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:35.220
 Austrian army in 1977 under the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.440
 name of 77 steg or assault weapon 77 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.900
 for its clear year for the year it was 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.049
 created mass production began the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.720
 following year or in 1988 and so was born 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.650
 one of the best assault rifles in 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.390
 all the times as they see her as 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.329
 I was saying a little bit of water 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.180
 or boom is heavier in the back 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.430
 that is replete with mechanisms in a 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.500
 small space not all got him in 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.510
 the back of this weapon these 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.000
 times because it harms the aim on 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.940
 all in troops that are basically not 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.890
 trained not but nevertheless this is 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.709
 lack of balance did not prevent them from not 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.229
 It was so bad it was not as bad as it was 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.940
 you might think it's not actually wielding and 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.920
 shoot the boom with one hand 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.690
 it's much simpler than with others 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.700
 assault rifles because it is lighter 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.190
 and how has the heavy back the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.960
 you can with half put in your in your down 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.260
 of your shoulder and all this under your 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 arm so well this has been a bit 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.770
 of the statistics of this people weapon 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.320
 I hope you have not liked today we will 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.940
 continue then reviewing weapons the one that follows 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.370
 is the ak-47 the famous at 447 9 well how 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.440
 they looked on the screen too, because this one 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.250
 I will also be showing you in 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.560
 screen what was the boom in black 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.450
 cabs 1 which is what we are 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.800
 used to seeing us one of my 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.900
 favorite because it was like the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.340
 I looked and saw the second edition of 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.930
 this weapon and for third the edition that 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.660
 is the one used in the 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.670
 army then basically of today 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.080
 not so I hope you liked this 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.740
 no weapon and could I think of 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.740
 stay with this one 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.819
 of this new series that we bring in the 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.620
 channel and another very important thing that if 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.949
 they want to watch the original video of what 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.810
 which is the boom made by fps brazil 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.819
 small clips that looked on screen 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.440
 I'll put the video link in the 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.120
 description to watch the whole video 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.460
 complete and all the videos of this one 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.840
 this great person of the character in 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.720
 youtube where they make video about 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.960
 health so youtube we watch the while 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.960
 people
