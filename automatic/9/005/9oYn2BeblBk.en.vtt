00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
and they can't do that because then the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.210

game will be revealed and that's why I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.860 
game will be revealed and that's why I
think<00:02:30.700> we're<00:02:30.850> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.150> see<00:02:31.180> more<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.810> more

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
think we're going to see more and more

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.590 
think we're going to see more and more
money<00:02:32.200> poured<00:02:32.620> into<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.070> rat<00:02:33.460> hole<00:02:33.600> because

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
money poured into this rat hole because

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.390 
money poured into this rat hole because
of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> election<00:02:35.290> calendar<00:02:35.500> they<00:02:35.980> can't<00:02:36.250> do

of the election calendar they can't do

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.100 
of the election calendar they can't do
it<00:02:36.490> in<00:02:36.580> 2010<00:02:37.090> because<00:02:37.360> Congress<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:37.930> for

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it in 2010 because Congress is up for

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.930 
it in 2010 because Congress is up for

up and pay up is it true that tarp which

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.270 
up and pay up is it true that tarp which
was<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.440> know<00:02:56.470> seven<00:02:56.860> hundred<00:02:57.100> billion

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
was you know seven hundred billion

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.980 
was you know seven hundred billion
dollars<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:59.130> one<00:03:00.150> lump<00:03:01.150> sum<00:03:01.480> of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
dollars that that is not one lump sum of

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.020 
dollars that that is not one lump sum of
seven<00:03:02.410> hundred<00:03:02.650> million<00:03:02.800> dollars<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.310> billion

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
seven hundred million dollars or billion

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.710 
seven hundred million dollars or billion
dollars<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.800> that's<00:03:05.800> revolving<00:03:06.790> 700<00:03:07.600> is

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
dollars that is that's revolving 700 is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.290 
dollars that is that's revolving 700 is
so<00:03:07.840> they<00:03:07.960> they<00:03:08.410> can<00:03:08.590> lose<00:03:08.830> 400<00:03:09.490> billion<00:03:10.060> but

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
so they they can lose 400 billion but

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.000 
so they they can lose 400 billion but
there's<00:03:10.480> still<00:03:10.660> seven<00:03:11.440> hundred<00:03:11.740> billion

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
there's still seven hundred billion

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.800 
there's still seven hundred billion
there<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.550> they<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.850> use<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.330> right<00:03:13.600> so

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
there that they can use is that right so

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.810 
there that they can use is that right so
it's<00:03:14.170> not<00:03:14.290> really<00:03:14.370> 700<00:03:15.370> billion<00:03:15.520> it's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
it's not really 700 billion it's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.750 
it's not really 700 billion it's
whatever<00:03:16.030> they<00:03:16.420> want<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.140> be<00:03:17.700> right<00:03:18.700> in

whatever they want it to be right in

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.700 
whatever they want it to be right in
