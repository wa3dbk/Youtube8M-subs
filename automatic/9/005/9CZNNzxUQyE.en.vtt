second

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.399 
second
thinking<00:02:09.489> like<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:09.819> if<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.420> ship<00:02:10.959> off<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
thinking like this if you ship off the

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.649 
thinking like this if you ship off the
earth<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.459> him<00:02:12.670> must<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.030> been<00:02:13.209> somewhere

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
earth the him must have been somewhere

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.680 
earth the him must have been somewhere
in<00:02:13.870> space<00:02:14.549> okay<00:02:15.549> or<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.390> other<00:02:16.420> planet

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
in space okay or on some other planet

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.699 
in space okay or on some other planet
that<00:02:17.290> requires<00:02:17.769> space<00:02:18.330> okay<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.500> it

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
that requires space okay so it is it

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.550 
that requires space okay so it is it
isn't<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.190> oh<00:02:21.340> my<00:02:21.400> god<00:02:21.670> she<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:21.970> shipped<00:02:22.330> off

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
isn't like oh my god she was shipped off

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.899 
isn't like oh my god she was shipped off
from<00:02:23.560> some<00:02:23.860> planet<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.430> doesn't<00:02:24.610> even

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
from some planet that doesn't even

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.759 
from some planet that doesn't even
require<00:02:25.120> space<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.900> you're<00:02:26.349> coming<00:02:26.650> from

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.490 
require space if you're coming from
earth<00:02:27.159> then<00:02:27.239> you're<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.840> know<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.019> have<00:02:29.319> that

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
gravity in that space so that really

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.770 
gravity in that space so that really
what<00:02:33.069> this<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.579> explained<00:02:33.940> enough<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.510> if
