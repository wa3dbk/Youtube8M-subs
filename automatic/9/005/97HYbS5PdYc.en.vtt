you don't really need to check it so it
doesn't<00:01:25.409> matter<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> part<00:01:26.850> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
doesn't matter but this is the part that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
doesn't matter but this is the part that
matters<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> chimney<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.740> think

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
matters so this is the chimney I think

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.770 
matters so this is the chimney I think
it<00:01:29.310> looks<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.579> chimney<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.240> but

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it looks like chimney I don't know but

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
it looks like chimney I don't know but
tier<00:01:31.170> 1<00:01:31.409> check<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:33.150> down<00:01:33.329> here

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
tier 1 check it if you want go down here

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
tier 1 check it if you want go down here
here's<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.740> remember<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> way

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
here's the so you can remember the way

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
here's the so you can remember the way
to<00:01:35.579> ITA<00:01:36.000> cuz<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> maze<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to ITA cuz it's kind of like a maze so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.950 
to ITA cuz it's kind of like a maze so
you<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.590> left<00:01:38.369> straight<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.750> way

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you go here left straight go this way

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.370 
you go here left straight go this way
the<00:01:40.950> nope<00:01:41.280> wrong<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.689> way

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the nope wrong way this way this way

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.849 
the nope wrong way this way this way
this<00:01:43.409> way

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.200 

yeah<00:01:47.859> and<00:01:48.310> then<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.670> can<00:01:48.789> see<00:01:48.939> right<00:01:48.969> here

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
yeah and then you can see right here

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.109 
yeah and then you can see right here
that<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> double<00:01:50.020> tier<00:01:50.380> 2<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:51.460> that's

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
that this is a double tier 2 so that's

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.669 
that this is a double tier 2 so that's
why<00:01:52.270> it's<00:01:52.299> really<00:01:52.689> good<00:01:52.869> i'm<00:01:53.049> usually<00:01:53.289> I'll

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
why it's really good i'm usually I'll
