00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
perfect form the person who asked me to
do<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> video<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.020> plyometric<00:00:19.680> push-ups<00:00:20.070> which

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
do a video on plyometric push-ups which

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.090 
do a video on plyometric push-ups which
is<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> next<00:00:20.820> video<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.510> gonna<00:00:21.600> release

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100

asked me to talk about how to perform

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.480 
asked me to talk about how to perform
plyometric<00:00:25.380> push-ups<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.160> basically

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
plyometric push-ups which are basically

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
plyometric push-ups which are basically
clapping<00:00:27.029> push-ups<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.660> explosive<00:00:28.230> push-ups

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
clapping push-ups and explosive push-ups

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.890 
clapping push-ups and explosive push-ups
with<00:00:29.099> perfect<00:00:29.550> form<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.300> want<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> tell<00:00:30.750> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
with perfect form and I want to tell you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680 
with perfect form and I want to tell you
that<00:00:31.109> perfect<00:00:31.349> form<00:00:31.920> doesn't<00:00:32.250> exist<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that perfect form doesn't exist for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
that perfect form doesn't exist for
example<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.410> shoulder<00:00:34.710> video<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.130> this

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
example in my shoulder video I do this

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.810 
example in my shoulder video I do this
exercise<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:40.230> would<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.829> me<00:00:41.670> doing

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
exercise and you would see this me doing

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.200 
exercise and you would see this me doing
this<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:44.219> say<00:00:44.430> I'm<00:00:44.550> doing<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> push-up

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this and you say I'm doing the push-up

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
this and you say I'm doing the push-up
strong<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.410> doing<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.070> making

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
strong but what I'm doing is I'm making

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.940 
strong but what I'm doing is I'm making
it<00:00:47.579> focused<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.989> shoulders<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it focused more on the shoulders if you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740 
it focused more on the shoulders if you
see<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> person<00:00:50.640> doing<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> muscle<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> he

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
see a person doing a muscle up and he

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080 
see a person doing a muscle up and he
uses<00:00:52.050> swing<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:53.280> order<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> perform<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
uses swing in order to perform the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
uses swing in order to perform the
muscle<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> that's<00:00:55.469> not

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
muscle up it's not that that's not

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520 
muscle up it's not that that's not
perfect<00:00:56.280> form<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.390> he<00:00:57.600> has<00:00:57.840> his<00:00:58.170> way<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
perfect form it's just he has his way of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
perfect form it's just he has his way of
doing<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> muscle<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> involves

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
doing the muscle up and it involves

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.270 
doing the muscle up and it involves
other<00:01:00.449> muscle<00:01:00.899> groups<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> basically

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
other muscle groups so it basically

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
other muscle groups so it basically
depends<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.420> goal<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.110> trying

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
depends on your goal if you are trying

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
depends on your goal if you are trying
to<00:01:04.830> work<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.549> certain<00:01:05.760> muscle<00:01:06.030> group<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.540> or

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
to work a certain muscle group out or

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.890 
to work a certain muscle group out or
trying<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.890> perfect<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:09.119> muscle<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.780> do

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
trying to perfect your muscle up to do

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.719 
trying to perfect your muscle up to do
it<00:01:10.049> slowly<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.430> pure

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it slowly and to do it with pure

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
it slowly and to do it with pure
strength<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.390> no<00:01:12.540> momentum<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
strength with no momentum you have a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
strength with no momentum you have a
different<00:01:15.509> definition<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.170> perfect<00:01:16.470> form

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
different definition of perfect form

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
different definition of perfect form
than<00:01:17.070> somebody<00:01:17.490> else<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.780> you're

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
than somebody else because if you're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
than somebody else because if you're
going<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.590> gymnastics<00:01:19.970> they<00:01:20.970> don't<00:01:21.180> require

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
going into gymnastics they don't require

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
going into gymnastics they don't require
you<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> completely<00:01:22.770> slow<00:01:23.100> muscle<00:01:23.520> up

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you to do a completely slow muscle up

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
you to do a completely slow muscle up
they<00:01:24.420> swing<00:01:24.960> into<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.439> start<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:27.290> right

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
they swing into it start up here right

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
they swing into it start up here right
and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.400> their<00:01:29.640> whole

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and then from here they do their whole

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
and then from here they do their whole
routine<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.860> depends<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:32.490> where

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
routine it depends if you're where

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.490 
routine it depends if you're where
you're<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.509> gymnastics<00:01:34.040> obviously<00:01:35.040> so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you're at in gymnastics obviously so

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.899 
you're at in gymnastics obviously so
when<00:01:37.500> we're<00:01:37.650> talking<00:01:37.799> about<00:01:38.130> perfect<00:01:38.369> form

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
when we're talking about perfect form

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.679 
when we're talking about perfect form
we're<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.930> describing<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> form<00:01:41.329> that<00:01:42.329> most

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
we're just describing the form that most

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.920 
we're just describing the form that most
people<00:01:43.229> find<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.100> safest<00:01:44.670> okay<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.570> whenever

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
people find the safest okay so whenever

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
people find the safest okay so whenever
I'm<00:01:46.200> talking<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:46.560> perfect<00:01:47.100> form<00:01:47.399> I'm

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I'm talking about perfect form I'm

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
I'm talking about perfect form I'm
talking<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> safest<00:01:49.140> possible<00:01:49.530> form

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
talking about the safest possible form

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.550 
talking about the safest possible form
of<00:01:50.399> doing<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.820> exercise<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.380> means

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
of doing an exercise so if that means

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
of doing an exercise so if that means
doing<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> slowly<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.850> doing<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> slowly<00:01:54.600> if

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
doing it slowly it's doing it slowly if

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.899 
doing it slowly it's doing it slowly if
that<00:01:55.380> means<00:01:55.560> practicing<00:01:56.219> easier<00:01:56.670> moves

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that means practicing easier moves

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.760 
that means practicing easier moves
before<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> move<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.229> that's

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
before you move on to this one that's

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.249 
before you move on to this one that's
what<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.100> means<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.640> basically<00:02:00.259> decreasing

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
what it means it's basically decreasing

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.999 
what it means it's basically decreasing
the<00:02:01.829> amount<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.250> injury<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:04.009> per
