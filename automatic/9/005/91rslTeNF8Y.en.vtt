00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
up to a phenom 2 x6 and I see what's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
up to a phenom 2 x6 and I see what's
inside<00:01:02.270> let's<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:04.519> we<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> bio<00:01:06.240> remote

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
power button just on both the board so

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.469 
power button just on both the board so
actually<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.130> know<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:27.030> is<00:04:27.240> quite<00:04:27.450> a

SATA ports with one at the side facing

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.609 
SATA ports with one at the side facing
up<00:05:14.969> the<00:05:15.300> one<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.539> others<00:05:15.809> are<00:05:15.989> facing<00:05:16.289> out<00:05:16.439> and

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:18.619 
up the one the others are facing out and

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:22.429 
up the one the others are facing out and
basically<00:05:19.619> that's<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.749> now<00:05:21.749> this<00:05:22.019> but<00:05:22.259> also

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
basically that's it now this but also
