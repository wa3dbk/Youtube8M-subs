 Hello everyone, Anchik Martynova 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.099
 Today I will tell and show you how to weave 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.530
 spiral harness from beads and glass beads 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.610
 the material that we need beads 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.420
 number 10 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.270
 bugle 6 millimeter fishing line diameter 25 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.980
 millimeters bead needle base under 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.970
 bracelet scissors lighter and pencil 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.389
 let's get down to the bracelet we need 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.550
 three and a half meters of fishing line we will settle one 

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:38.859
 the end of the line in the needle and the second 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.859
 make a temporary stub out of any bush 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.050
 step 1 we string 2 glass beads between 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:15.840
 them 2 beads we lower this set 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:22.800
 down step 2 sell the needle in two 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:26.970
 the first beads of our set here is 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.920
 we left the beginning of the harness is now possible for 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 convenience use a pencil or 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.729
 pen whose diameter comes in 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.390
 triangle formed 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.410
 step 3 we string 2 beads on the fishing line and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 1 bugle 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.670
 we pass in the next second bead 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.070
 let's move in a circle 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 which side can you navigate in 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.140
 depending on which side the fishing line 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.310
 It comes with 1 bead to the right if the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.320
 moving clockwise 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.240
 again we string the same set of beads and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.960
 we pass the following second in a row 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.960
 Gusev 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.019
 the third time we make the transition to the next 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.530
 row so we continue to increase live by 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.530
 spirals 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.200
 harness is very light and beautiful color can 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.600
 make it more fun for example every 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.300
 bugles choose different colors and then 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.040
 the spiral will be 3 color in this case 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.940
 the main thing is to constantly alternate the correct 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.370
 A set of bugles by color is also a plait 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.830
 can be done already or more widely use 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.750
 at the heart of 2 or 4 bugles but for 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.750
 our bracelet is best 3 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.240
 simply 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.680
 so we made a harness 15 cm finish 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.260
 him as on usually a few knots 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.260
 which are knitted from one end of the fishing line 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.030
 or 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.429
 cut off the excess line 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.869
 leave about 5 millimeters and then 

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:55.449
 light a cigarette lighter 

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:57.699
 dismiss the other side of the harness first 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.479
 do not remove the cap and then do such 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.479
 at the Christmas tree 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.430
 Now dress harness nanoshu basis 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.680
 pandora bracelet if such a framework you 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.140
 No, you can wear any bracelet from 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.790
 usually chains even make it on 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.150
 elastic band as it has a property 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.150
 stretch 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.560
