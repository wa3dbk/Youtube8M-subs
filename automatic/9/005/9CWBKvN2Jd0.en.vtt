I think the Olympics also need young
sports<00:00:42.610> they<00:00:43.000> need<00:00:43.180> young<00:00:43.450> people<00:00:43.480> I'm<00:00:44.410> pretty

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
honestly I don't think that my

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
honestly I don't think that my
experience<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> Olympics<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.200> helped<00:01:58.470> me

for<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.920> next<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.400> because<00:01:59.580> I<00:01:59.970> think<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
for the next one because I think the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.899 
for the next one because I think the
Olympics<00:02:00.990> changed<00:02:01.830> since<00:02:02.220> this<00:02:02.400> time<00:02:02.670> and

appearance<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.560> pressure<00:02:49.830> will<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.069> higher

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
appearance the pressure will be higher

for<00:02:53.430> sure<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.000> gonna<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> super<00:02:54.660> big

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
pressure for the Olympics I think that's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.630 
pressure for the Olympics I think that's
the<00:02:58.049> thing<00:02:58.290> too<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> Olympics<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.549> you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the thing too at the Olympics that you

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880 
the thing too at the Olympics that you
can<00:02:59.790> handle<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.299> pressure<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.019> do<00:03:01.709> your

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
can handle this pressure and do your

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.610 
can handle this pressure and do your
best<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.579> special<00:03:03.239> moment<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:04.320> about

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
best in this special moment it's about

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.340 
best in this special moment it's about
60<00:03:05.370> seconds<00:03:05.850> which<00:03:06.090> will<00:03:06.299> decide<00:03:06.630> about<00:03:07.079> who

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
60 seconds which will decide about who

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.090 
60 seconds which will decide about who
takes<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.100> medals<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:10.560> gonna<00:03:10.739> be<00:03:10.890> tough

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
