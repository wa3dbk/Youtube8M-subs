00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.300
 with curry sauce and broccoli 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.179
 so fonts and broccoli 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.400
 frozen so I put them in a dish 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.580
 adapted with a little bit of water at the bottom 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 so here is my broccoli so there we 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 put two is 4.5 small package that's 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
 actually in the mines in the microwave and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.980
 which we follow the note that marked on 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.899
 the paper in years on the seventeen bag 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 minutes to 900 good me I have a thousand but 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.730

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.280
 then the turkey escalopes will be samp 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.300
 gr pass actually we will make a cream 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 so with fresh cream 1 to 4 % of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 fat 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.020
 so that will be our only source of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.250
 fat for this lunch 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.040
 at the dawn of dan here 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.020
 classical 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.340
 so I warm my points well 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.340
 do them and salaberry 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.759
 its final will of course 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.759
 to decorate a little bit the follies 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.659
 so if you eat as input 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000
 cruditÃ©s all that not of course not 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.369
 of oil only in seasoning 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.149
 malus so canvas and on the good 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.149
 of course the meat 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.690
 all out 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.690
 yes in all 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.390
 it's pepper 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.030
 vincenti 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.030
 two backs 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:44.120
 so I do two ways practice 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.120
 we are two to eat at noon 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.240
 and my companion so here 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.590
 yesterday 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.480
 during this time broccoli 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.459
 in France whole are not the smell of 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.459
 substitutes are approximately 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.410
 sap to pay 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.410
 meat to grill 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.190
 this is our ropes aircraft very well he 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.190
 showed how to do solid 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.290
 this is so zealous call of the dance in 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.240
 escape then for those who may have 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.130
 not too much there since proven the size is 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.720
 a little bit like that any time for 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.250
 also not damaged your stove and who 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.140
 have looked inside you see 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.670
 case of the offices here are the guys the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.800
 the more I let go I'll go 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.500
 so get what I'm doing now 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.550
 I do not want to see her 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.170
 put in the sky because 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.510
 theoretically during a sauce at the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.580
 cream at best remove the meat because 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.970
 that it tends to be too bad to do 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.580
 harden at the barn reduces my opaque fire 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.710
 would miss then you see that basically 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.510
 from the stove a guy build on the 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.730
 meat that stayed then we're going 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.120
 to go from the principle that we are going 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.120
 near 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.650
 is 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.610
 it 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.610
 by ap 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:20.889
 paul ii 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:22.600
 we will put a little more to the curia at 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.840
 will one according as you like that this 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.840
 is 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.260
 but it's you because as there is 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.180
 not a lot of sauce actually 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.500
 to 2 to reduce or apn has good I 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.980
 believe there is nothing else that is 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:51.470
 true we try to do like the 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.470
 stove and rich a cake amp the sauce 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.020
 to do a little bit if we think that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.420
 it's a bit light 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.780
 then broccoli is careful of 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.180
 not burn let's go boilard because 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:13.890
 it's very hot it will take them out 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:15.500
 like that towards his choices we will 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.760
 tickets we will check 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:30.380
 you see they are cooked there is no 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:37.080
 worry there they are not at these areas and 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:38.820
 with I think the curry cream when 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.910
 same important at the cost of 5 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:46.920
 it's a little bit of juice lama well 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:48.060
 this is the perfume then the broccoli 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:58.500
 we're going to go that's because they 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:06:00.420
 are installed at all I think the 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.850
 only once we are a little bit 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.800
 but good corner of our side we do not have 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.289
 right to eat bread I think 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.749
 it may not be worth it 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.909
 the 3 m here is so it makes you a 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:13.339
 small plate 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:16.219
 here is knowing that well you ate 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:18.020
 an entry or that you can put 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.979
 more broccoli or you can 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.779
 put another vegetable 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.779
 here is the evening will
