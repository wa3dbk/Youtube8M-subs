00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi to all that what welcome in 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.010
 this brand new video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.139
 today I want to show you a little game for 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.570
 android but there is also for both iphone 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.790
 followed a little the tube you will know that brad 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.600
 has already played this game on his 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.910
 a second channel, however, came out yesterday 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.529
 update and so I thought that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 I could never catch the ball 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.500
 to show it to you for those who didn't know 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.279
 what is this game is called tile floor 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.279
 being wrong 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.760
 I will put the title description and what it is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 then let's go see it for a moment 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.340
 the classic mode with the stuff on 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.989
 screen allows you to touch the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:57.120
 black rectangles and do a thing of this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 kind must be a little more here 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.859
 various modes what has been 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 introduced with the new update of 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.869
 yesterday at the arcade more traces than a moment 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.409
 from arcade to make us but let's see where 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.610
 came as that every time he allows 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.979
 a key 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.130
 let's say it's not a note that makes one 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 part in a song because it's a bit 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 I don't like audio system in fact I have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.670
 started playing music on raising 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 but I thought maybe for the video 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.729
 it would have been better to put it and it is a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.630
 game that requires a lot of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.630
 be careful because it is very easy 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.630
 make a mistake 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.700
 this is canon indie 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.510
 no farewell 405 my maximum was kind 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.250
 190 it is good for me to record , I say 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.489
 I do well to record what cool 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.959
 goodbye anyway today I have to show why 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.520
 more then we see immediately with three 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.819
 bomb mode 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.120
 let's say lightning and double bomb 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.950
 it will simply add some keys 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.140
 reds that we will not have to press 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.360
 the only thing you don't like about studies is 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.430
 mode is that the song does not skip the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.170
 what snores in the song ie they count 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 also pressing the red button 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.700
 so if one starts listening to a 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.700
 bit the song goes wrong 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.439
 and all these three modes after a while 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.720
 they become quite difficult 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.200
 especially the one with the lightning that 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.819
 more than lightning we say yes to the fumes 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.829
 because in the end it symbolizes lightning 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.390
 what happens I show him between two 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:47.799
 seconds however poisoned well too 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.799
 this exit even more light ibra 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.859
 what happens almost the monster is not seen 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.950
 for a moment but you have to keep on 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.700
 press the keys because if you don't press 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.700
 keys you're fucked 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.379
 and this I found the most difficult is 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.580
 the most difficult mode because sometimes 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:20.810
 you seem to have to go on instead 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:24.169
 no here is this is the most difficult 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.389
 according to me then we have double that is 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.040
 also this beautiful begins a cagata then 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.699
 becomes a bit difficult with speed 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:36.699
 he wasn't wrong 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:36.699
 money money arcade double 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:46.700
 obviously it happens that we also have the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.620
 double buttons is nothing 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.330
 particular beginning but how does it start 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.250
 take speed from those rather 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.510
 annoyance especially for those who play from a 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.960
 bit like me and got used to the allo 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.960
 standard 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.469
 ok 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:15.780
 well I'd say it's all we can say so can 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:20.669
 say to practice I recommend you to use 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.909
 the mode is called her mode 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.740
 the dreaded her and her 12 seconds because 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:30.810
 I think it's paid because as I said 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.210
 I go very slow I can't do it to 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.729
 I'm sorry from the institution anyway I go one 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.819
 he was so slow and when he is going to 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.770
 finish the time by the wrong way but one 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.610
 I show you when time is running out 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.310
 veil renews and therefore being able to go to 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.310
 speed you want and work out 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.649
 oh well you understand 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.050
 and this is an access game like it 

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:20.199
 would define rates because it is a game that 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.080
 I only play access but wow how 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:28.719
 something I managed to do 404 percent 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:31.659
 405 minus go so high and well for this 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:35.189
 video is all thank you for having me 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.189
 hello hi they are all
