golden

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.520 

right<00:01:40.360> there<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:40.570> triangle<00:01:41.049> formed<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.439> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
right there a triangle formed in the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.139 
right there a triangle formed in the
back<00:01:41.710> court<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.490> was<00:01:42.640> actually<00:01:42.880> a

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
back court that was actually a

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.539 
back court that was actually a
transition<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:44.439> can<00:01:44.619> also<00:01:44.799> be<00:01:44.979> done<00:01:45.100> when

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
transition this can also be done when

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.319 
transition this can also be done when
all<00:01:45.789> your<00:01:46.270> opponent's<00:01:47.140> defenders<00:01:47.649> are

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
all your opponent's defenders are

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.609 
all your opponent's defenders are
defending<00:01:49.329> you<00:01:49.450> or<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.079> can<00:01:50.140> also<00:01:50.289> be<00:01:50.409> done<00:01:50.560> in

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
defending you or it can also be done in

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.370 
defending you or it can also be done in
the<00:01:50.740> transition<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:54.130> key<00:01:54.399> is<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.200> lot

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
the transition the key is to get a lot

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.469 
the transition the key is to get a lot
of<00:01:56.409> passes<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.189> we<00:01:57.450> believe<00:01:58.450> that<00:02:00.479> right

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
of passes and we believe that right

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.730 
of passes and we believe that right
there<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.659> was<00:02:01.810> great<00:02:02.079> we<00:02:02.409> believe<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
there that was great we believe that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.160 
there that was great we believe that
making<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.880> lot<00:02:03.969> of<00:02:04.000> passes<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.630> back<00:02:04.840> court

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
making a lot of passes in the back court

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.679 
making a lot of passes in the back court
changes<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.670> position<00:02:06.819> of<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.299> goalie<00:02:07.479> in

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
changes the position of the goalie in

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.640 
changes the position of the goalie in
some<00:02:07.899> way<00:02:08.019> or<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.700> changes<00:02:09.700> his<00:02:09.910> momentum

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
some way or it changes his momentum

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.070 
some way or it changes his momentum
before<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.830> take<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> shot<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.420> getting<00:02:13.900> all

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
before you take the shot so getting all

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.559 
before you take the shot so getting all
these<00:02:14.200> passes<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.730> think<00:02:15.910> better<00:02:16.269> than

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
these passes in is we think better than

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.750 
these passes in is we think better than
just<00:02:16.780> simply<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.489> charging<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.579> shooting<00:02:20.760> is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
just simply for charging and shooting is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.960 
just simply for charging and shooting is
also<00:02:22.120> important<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:24.130> aim<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
also important that can aim in the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.759 
also important that can aim in the
direction<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.720> pass<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.140> traveling

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
direction that the pass is traveling

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.490 
direction that the pass is traveling
giving<00:02:27.579> you<00:02:27.730> extra<00:02:28.060> more<00:02:28.390> momentum<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.349> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
giving you extra more momentum on the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.009 
giving you extra more momentum on the
shot<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:29.980> side<00:02:33.840> that's<00:02:34.840> usually

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
shot for that side that's usually

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:44.660 
shot for that side that's usually
natural<00:02:35.650> anyway

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.390 

now<00:02:45.670> right<00:02:45.880> there<00:02:46.320> he<00:02:47.320> went<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.650> he<00:02:48.100> thought<00:02:48.220> I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
now right there he went to he thought I

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.900 
now right there he went to he thought I
was<00:02:48.430> gonna<00:02:48.640> pass<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.180> peach<00:02:49.390> for<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.780> shot<00:02:49.990> I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
was gonna pass the peach for the shot I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.430 
was gonna pass the peach for the shot I
saw<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.090> he<00:02:52.270> went<00:02:52.450> away<00:02:52.570> from<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.230> went

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
saw that he went away from me so I went

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.980 
saw that he went away from me so I went
through<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> village<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.130> Belgian<00:02:54.670> waffle<00:02:55.090> so

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
through a village in Belgian waffle so

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.900 
through a village in Belgian waffle so
that<00:02:56.170> shows<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.620> how<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.070> can<00:02:57.520> choose

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
that shows you how you can choose

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.890 
that shows you how you can choose
between<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.540> past<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.080> shot<00:02:59.440> or<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.740> trick

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
between the past and shot or a trick

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.900 
between the past and shot or a trick
it's<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.990> pretty<00:03:02.200> neat<00:03:02.440> strategy<00:03:03.010> because<00:03:03.760> of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
it's a pretty neat strategy because of

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:26.160 
it's a pretty neat strategy because of
that<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:06.310> become<00:03:06.460> unpredictable

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:43.870 

a<00:03:27.720> special

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.280 

and<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.090> that's<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.540> that's<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.870> triangle

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
and so that's it that's the triangle

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.100 
and so that's it that's the triangle
offense<00:03:46.730> we're<00:03:47.730> working<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.210> making<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.870> little

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
offense we're working on making a little

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.430 
offense we're working on making a little
better<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:50.430> that's<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.970> basic<00:03:51.120> idea<00:03:52.190> bye<00:03:53.190> bye
