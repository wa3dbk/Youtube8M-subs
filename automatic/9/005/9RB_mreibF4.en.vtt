00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
I usually cover it up

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.589 
I usually cover it up
one<00:00:12.870> moment<00:00:13.650> though<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:15.000> idea<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.420> to

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
one moment though because the idea is to

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
one moment though because the idea is to
make<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> Dutch<00:00:16.289> oven<00:00:16.470> type<00:00:16.710> thing<00:00:17.029> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
make it like a Dutch oven type thing so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.429 
make it like a Dutch oven type thing so
say<00:00:18.210> cocina<00:00:18.600> no<00:00:18.720> solamente<00:00:18.960> point<00:00:19.350> coloured

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
say cocina no solamente point coloured

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.099 
say cocina no solamente point coloured
so<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.340> see<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.090> darkness<00:00:24.539> actually
