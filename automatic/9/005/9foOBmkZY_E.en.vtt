00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.669
 and the cultural santander houses exhibition is today in Brazilian art 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.130
 contemporary collection gilberto chateaubriand 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.750
 are 126 works that give an overview of the art in brazil of the last 15 years 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.279
 and I'm here with marconi maranhense as a plastic artist and will accompany me 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.320
 on this journey through Asia that selic will be marked 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
 It's all right. 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 ae 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.780
 antÃ³nio 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.320
 for example the case of the team 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 a table two chairs and a lot of stones 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220
 or it will be a sculpture 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.250
 and this one on the team 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.560
 advertising 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.790
 what will the artist do with the salad 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.570
 I think that year 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.980
 most obvious thing and the formation of Brazilian politics 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 the formanda face of the fingers each forming 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.220
 His intention is cool to be very cool. 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.070
 and one of the most disturbing and perhaps most recent works in this session 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.350
 this one here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.770
 composed of a lot of 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.710
 being thus with a very curious title 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.940
 all men slept with their mothers and some women 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.930
 with your parents 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.700
 qq room rate brennan 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 the aesthetic appeal of llamas and wonderful 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.720
 It makes me want to start. 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 miss them all in the middle 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.760
 that at first I can not see anything 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.400
 nothing of the title in the work 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.160
 so then 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.880
 I assume the guy made a big joke with the title of this work or 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.480
 what measures and this comes into play is often synonymous with 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.880
 he reiterated the program are still not given me anything 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.380
 no way in lisbon tomorrow to win another routine 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.469
 she 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.110
 It's when you take a play that you need that time for another you feel 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.759
 something for this work you need a new technique to understand that 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.730
 the art or have to perceive the artist 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.620
 so you can not work 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.540
 and I think that this work has to be talked about alone it was born like the 3 to 1 to 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.499
 me she loses pretty hard 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:41.529
 of the senses 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.149
 what do you want contemporary exchange an exchange of knowledge 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.609
 it's no use saying the artist meant it 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.919
 that knowledge is not this 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:55.399
 so we have to have a new password but our manawi in the plans 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:56.549
 knowledge 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.849
 we have to change with the work 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.090
 and the contemporary offers us this permanent exchange, no matter if it is 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.329
 a child is an adult if a person started in the arts or not 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:09.989
 what matters is naughty
