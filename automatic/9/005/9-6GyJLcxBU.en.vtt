 for a little tutorial that will be put on 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.659
 a niche on a software or a game 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.609

 phone 8 is so today I you 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.519

 so for that in fact it will be enough for you 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.660
 to download software from which 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.170
 find here 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.300
 this is pseries months of his servers so 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.040
 its server clients that will have to 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.980
 install on the pc and will install 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.440
 the application on your smartphone so 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.970
 actually put the handcuffs on your 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.340
 smartphone allow to emulate a 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.020
 trackpad actually in order to move the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.710
 cursor of your mouse I will make you 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.470
 a little girl and an example at the end 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.670
 actually a little presentation 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.469
 it also allows you to control 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.869
 natively done ferrand software 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:11.049
 as itunes media player finally spotify 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.890
 a file reading software 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.020
 audio or video 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.049
 so for a start you are going to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.530
 go on the internet is there you go 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.299
 typing peeled slanted soft servers 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.670
 and so there you go actually going on 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.799
 this gala that thickens remastered point 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.479
 com so I would put you well and there 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.569
 you will just have to click on links 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.100
 servers so it's free of course 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.990
 so that sail pretty quickly so me 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.540
 I of the night because I already have it you 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.640
 does the installation you 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.490
 or follow what they tell you and we will 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.860
 to meet immediately on my nokia 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.220
 lumia 500 one to show you how 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.230
 download the application 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.300
 so for the application so that's enough 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.250
 simple you go back to your smartphone 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.990
 under windows phone 8 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.120
 I do not know if it's compatible with 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.650
 the windows phone 7 7 points 5 or 7 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.970
 points 8 will I do not I do not think I 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.040
 will put you to the description 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.800
 so there you go in your research 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.320
 and there you type pc remote so it's 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.450
 same name as on your fold it face 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.920
 should download on pc so here 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.540
 are two choices made so either 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 free fashion series then series 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.640
 pro mode elsewhere at 2 euros 99 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.480
 so in fact the only difference he 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.890
 is between the two of them so that's actually 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.510
 there will be from there there will be advertising on 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.510
 the bench you're on paid will not 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.489
 ass is really one of the only 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.440
 difference that there is between the two so 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.530
 you click on it and you'll just have 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.630
 to click on install and therefore 4 mega 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.260
 bytes a fast oxidation rated 4 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.030
 5 stars 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.870
 here I am then then you you 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.510
 find with this app that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.920
 is the serial server mode peace so at 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.150
 wish in fact you will need two 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.489
 things the first one actually is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.290
 to open special servers month so 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.580
 place our servers the most important this 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.170
 is not that he denied the window 12 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.090
 hours since the window we are not going 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.989
 serve the most important is that in 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.000
 the taskbar 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.709
 finally here in your menu it is the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.709
 little icon the chain not know if you 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.060
 see a pcr remote server 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.739
 then the second thing is to have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.450
 your ip address is because to get 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.660
 connect wirelessly between 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.010
 your smartphone and your pc will require 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.930
 the ip address so that they can when 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.519
 even your pc so for those here you 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.350
 go tap go you go on your 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.950
 keyboard and you're going to put windows r 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.870
 that you open the window executed there 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.880
 you're just going ap how so cmd 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.550
 you're going to type ok there you go 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.930
 to arrive in your body 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.590
 your control system makes it so 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.310
 no need to open an administrator 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.440
 and there you go to do config ip all 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.940
 attached is so there actually you will 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.540
 the iped still a long time you're going to have 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.600
 lippé normally so here is ipv4 so 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.850
 there you will have your ip so then we 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.650
 will end up on your smartphone 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.720
 to show how to do so here 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.370
 then once on your windows phone 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.300
 everything you will have to do in 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.820
 do it's go in your apps 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.240
 on the teeth on the left tap on 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.370
 pacy remote expect this quick here 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.420
 in fact you will have to click on 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.650
 more so at the beginning you will have other 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.420
 prescriptions or ten years to be 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.860
 connected to the web raises client fault 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.450
 server is enabled and wherever you are 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.740
 connected in wifi does not have a cell phone 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.330
 you have just in front of you made return 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.580
 the ip address you are going to have found yourself 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.280
 just now with the ipconfig command 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 then you click add it's okay 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.600
 put the name of your pc or clicked 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.960
 on connecting to pc so here we are 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.690
 found with a screen a skin finally I 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.520
 do not know how I could tell you that 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.919
 pretty basic windows phone 8 so a 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.419
 first control second page the future 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.419
 apps offers apps to plc 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.320
 youtube and is third media control 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.610
 that's what I told you all about 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.720
 time to launch spotify windows 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.610
 media player etc 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.140
 so what interests us is fast 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.370
 done today is the evening of which 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.160
 you can see if a trackpad 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.330
 pretty fast enough actually and I'm going 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.410
 immediately make you a little 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.150
 demonstration 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.440
 so here we can see so my 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.210
 portable that is not connected at all 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.310
 which is just wifi with the trackpad 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.500
 is there we can see so the little 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.240
 mouse trying on the left of 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.990
 the screen so when I go up it goes up 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.430
 against the go down it's finally here 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.340
 when we do doubleclick finally here 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.850
 what for an application can for the 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.740
 close 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.390
 so it's pretty fluid one you can 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.230
 adjust the sensitivity if you want 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.919
 greater or less 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.290
 well, that's fine so that's all in 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.150
 did so so it was a little tutorial so on 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.910
 a rise in eight months first tutorial 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.670
 I do it again tests of applications well 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.050
 sure I thank a big big thank you for 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.030

 subscribers who do not subscribe 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.020
 little by little, that's about all 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.790

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.960
