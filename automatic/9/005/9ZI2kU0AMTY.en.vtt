00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.480
 welcome to a new video from the web 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.180
 repair yourself in this case the video 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.050
 is dedicated to a problem with the 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.570
 usb port of the pc to which he himself 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.270
 we connect the usb connector of a 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 accessory 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.420
 illuminates accessory but gives error 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.740
 communication port if we had said 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.740
 to roll 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.160
 we see properties will give us a problem 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.830
 of controller initially we have 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 to reload the driver 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.820
 re-update the drivers 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.290
 etcetera etcetera then just uninstall 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.710
 reinstall what would be 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.480
 habitually one of these problems and 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.750
 we continue the same continue with the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.140
 problem does not perfectly recognize the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.300
 usb port apart from the software theme the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.650
 issue of installing and uninstalling the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.810
 controller is to look for others more 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.449
 appropriate and others you do not have to 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.120
 rule out that the usb port of 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.400
 browser may be wrong you can 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.010
 have the welds split or that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.320
 the proper connector of the 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.170
 dirty computer and can be 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 working improperly as you see 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.800
 reconnected the connector again 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.130
 and now the usb port is correct no 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.869
 installed or uninstalled nothing like you see 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.190
 the port is failing so 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.690
 intermittent 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 I reconnect to see what I would do 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.630
 possibly error exactly we 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.600
 the port fails again so 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.580
 So I'm going to take off the computer and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.970
 with a little sandpaper with care 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.150
 I'm going to clean port connections 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.150
 usb to see if I get that I finally 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.640
 accept and work correctly 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.520
 accessory that I'm connecting we're going to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.429
 see how we would see no luck 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.390
 once I turn off the computer I will 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.590
 clean the contacts of the usb connector 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.200
 inside 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.360
 with a little sandpaper 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.690
 fixed fine and I cut out a piece of 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.319
 plastic for example from a bottle or from 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.300
 a clothes hanger or an exhibitor 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.739
 clothes from when you buy your 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.530
 plastics that come with clothes by 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.360
 example I have cut a small 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.900
 plastic quote piece to help me 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.239
 to wrap the sanding sheet and power 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.269
 reintroduce through the gap of the connector 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.040
 usb and clean it I'm cleaning and 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.680
 we see how it goes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.379
 I remember a piece of sandpaper 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.189
 first we will start with a winner a 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.189
 little thicker 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.170
 double to it 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.970
 You can proceed to clean the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.970
 internal contacts of the usb connector 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.620
 a little pass with lightness 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.209
 and then going on to do the same 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.209
 with a little thinner sandpaper 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.770
 in its various 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.780
 for 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.780
 can do different tests 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.819
 we will now apply a little bit of sandpaper 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.120
 fine 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:48.239
 and little by little , the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.239
 internal contacts of the usb connector 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.830
 when this will get the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.750
 connection between the male connector and the 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.750
 female base is perfect 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.110
 and we will see a little the dust generated with 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.110
 a brush and we will continue with the task 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.030
 Once the base of the connector has been sanded , 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.519
 reboots the pc and we go back to 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.470
 try the same 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.000
 checking that she recognizes said 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.000
 connector properly 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.180
 performs various tests of introducing and 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.880
 remove the connector 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.540
 and the pc already happens to recognize them in 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.420
 problems 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.360
 therefore more than once he guides us and 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.740
 only from a software problem a 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.410
 problem of the drivers of the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.850
 adapters of the interface you are 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.090
 using but also suspects 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.160
 the connectivity of the usb port since at 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.070
 same to introduce and be connectors 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.750
 in many cases it can fail and 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.750
 we can have problems with it 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.309
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.759
 may be useful and before a 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:22.169
 problem especially with the interface 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.180
 lm 327 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.370
 that you know that the problem can also 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.249
 be in the usb port after 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.930
 our pc greetings and I hope you continue 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.620
 they advertise it to the website in the 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.340
 videos 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.340
 network for all
