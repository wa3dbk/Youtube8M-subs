nerdy<00:00:36.630> came<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> actual<00:00:39.200> way<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
nerdy came up with the actual way that a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.020 
nerdy came up with the actual way that a
chunk<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.950> regenerated<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.790> no

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
chunk would be regenerated I have no

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.760 
chunk would be regenerated I have no
idea<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> was

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
idea what it would look like if it was

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 
idea what it would look like if it was
ever<00:00:43.920> done<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> straight<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
ever done you know straight about of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
ever done you know straight about of
course<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> world<00:00:46.440> doesn't<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:47.010> crash

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
course the world doesn't actually crash

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.330 
course the world doesn't actually crash
but<00:00:48.170> something<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.320> interesting<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
but something that's interesting is I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.470 
but something that's interesting is I
log<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.660> cutting<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> video<00:00:52.260> here

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
yeah blocks are gone the chunk actually

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.130 
yeah blocks are gone the chunk actually

regenerated um you can see well the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.950 
regenerated um you can see well the
blocks<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.620> pushed<00:01:01.800> over<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.960> had

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
blocks got pushed over here I had

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.340 
blocks got pushed over here I had
problems<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> weather<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.159> he<00:01:05.549> kind<00:01:06.180> of

got away um yeah you can see that the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460 
got away um yeah you can see that the
blocks<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:12.060> pushed<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.689> wither

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
blocks actually get pushed in and wither

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
blocks actually get pushed in and wither
breaks<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.970> on

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
breaks them and the way that's going on

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
is I just have a command block in there

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.270 
is I just have a command block in there
that's<00:01:19.979> summoning<00:01:20.880> an<00:01:21.119> item<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.630> an<00:01:22.229> NBT<00:01:22.770> tag

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that's summoning an item with an NBT tag

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.190 
that's summoning an item with an NBT tag
that<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> overflows<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> chunk

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
that kind of overflows the chunk

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
that kind of overflows the chunk
reloading<00:01:28.200> whatever<00:01:28.740> code<00:01:29.549> reloads<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
reloading whatever code reloads the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.289 
reloading whatever code reloads the
chunk<00:01:31.310> this<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.490> stop<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> item<00:01:33.180> gets

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
chunk this will stop the item gets

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.700 
chunk this will stop the item gets
summoned<00:01:33.540> inside<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> chunk<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.650> this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
summoned inside the chunk down in this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.910 
summoned inside the chunk down in this
cave<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.549> big<00:01:35.700> sack<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.920> so

need to do this yeah there we go you can
see<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.619> blocks<00:01:57.830> actually<00:01:58.070> got<00:01:58.430> generated

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
see the blocks actually got generated

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.880 
see the blocks actually got generated
you<00:01:59.509> can<00:01:59.540> see<00:01:59.900> him<00:02:00.020> now<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:00.470> there's<00:02:00.619> another

you can see him now so there's another
row<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.340> blocks<00:02:01.610> ready<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.060> be<00:02:02.119> harvested<00:02:02.270> in

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
row of blocks ready to be harvested in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.440 
row of blocks ready to be harvested in
there<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:04.670> two<00:02:04.820> little<00:02:05.150> tricks<00:02:05.330> I

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
there and then two little tricks I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.149 
there and then two little tricks I
wanted<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.810> mention<00:02:05.930> that<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.320> use<00:02:06.619> just

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
wanted to mention that I use just

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.120 
wanted to mention that I use just
because<00:02:08.050> they're<00:02:09.050> actually<00:02:09.380> kind<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.649> like<00:02:09.860> I

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
because they're actually kind of like I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.770 
because they're actually kind of like I
tried<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.789> build<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.060> thing<00:02:11.120> as<00:02:11.330> seriously

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
tried to build this thing as seriously

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.809 
tried to build this thing as seriously
as<00:02:11.900> possible<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.620> know<00:02:12.770> if<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.400> did

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
as possible you know if we actually did

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.120 
as possible you know if we actually did
have<00:02:13.970> chunk<00:02:14.209> regeneration<00:02:14.739> could<00:02:15.739> we<00:02:15.890> fully

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
have chunk regeneration could we fully

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.220 
have chunk regeneration could we fully
automate<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.760> harvesting<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
automate the harvesting of it so the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.070 
automate the harvesting of it so the
first<00:02:18.440> thing<00:02:18.530> here<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.310> detection<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
first thing here is the detection of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.390 
first thing here is the detection of
that<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> chunks<00:02:21.440> been<00:02:21.560> regenerated<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.310> we

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
that the chunks been regenerated so we

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.970 
that the chunks been regenerated so we
have<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.670> block<00:02:23.030> here<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:24.320> every<00:02:24.739> time<00:02:24.920> I

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
have this block here that every time I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.949 
have this block here that every time I
regenerate<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.640> chunk<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.330> gets<00:02:26.510> pushed<00:02:26.780> out

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
regenerate the chunk it gets pushed out

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.270 
regenerate the chunk it gets pushed out
this<00:02:27.680> piston<00:02:28.130> retracts<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.100> know

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
this piston retracts and then you know

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.060 
this piston retracts and then you know
when<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.940> chunk<00:02:32.150> we<00:02:32.269> do<00:02:32.390> regenerates<00:02:33.380> this

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
when the chunk we do regenerates this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.640 
when the chunk we do regenerates this
thing<00:02:34.280> will<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.519> right<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:35.200> right<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.410> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
thing will be right here right there and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.380 
thing will be right here right there and
then<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:37.850> block<00:02:38.630> will<00:02:38.660> extend<00:02:39.530> again<00:02:39.830> and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
then this block will extend again and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.059 
then this block will extend again and
power<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.569> line<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:41.870> everything<00:02:42.560> down

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
power this line and everything down

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.820 
power this line and everything down
there<00:02:43.250> will<00:02:43.400> do<00:02:43.550> its<00:02:43.700> stuff<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:45.350> second<00:02:45.709> thing

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
there will do its stuff the second thing

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.850 
there will do its stuff the second thing
I<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.220> mention<00:02:46.280> was<00:02:47.050> well<00:02:48.050> like<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.440> said<00:02:48.500> I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
I want to mention was well like I said I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.740 
I want to mention was well like I said I
don't<00:02:48.980> know<00:02:49.130> what<00:02:49.360> what's<00:02:50.360> going<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.630> be

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
don't know what what's going to be

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.210 
don't know what what's going to be
needed<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:51.110> actual<00:02:51.500> chunk<00:02:51.769> regeneration

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
needed for actual chunk regeneration

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.120 
needed for actual chunk regeneration
when<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.580> happens<00:02:53.080> but<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.860> particular

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
when it happens but in this particular

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.660 
when it happens but in this particular
version<00:02:55.820> on<00:02:56.180> an<00:02:56.390> item<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:57.019> needed<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
version on an item was needed and the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.250 
version on an item was needed and the
items<00:02:58.940> lost<00:02:59.150> every<00:02:59.450> time<00:02:59.630> same<00:02:59.840> with<00:02:59.959> a<00:02:59.989> boat

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
items lost every time same with a boat

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.479 
items lost every time same with a boat
and<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.180> what<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.510> figured<00:03:02.959> was<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> if<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:04.310> do

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
and so what I figured was a if you do

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.090 
and so what I figured was a if you do
need<00:03:04.670> an<00:03:04.820> item<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.420> be<00:03:05.930> used<00:03:06.260> for<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.890> chunk

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
need an item to be used for the chunk

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.800 
need an item to be used for the chunk
regeneration<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:07.970> could<00:03:08.120> take<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.329> from<00:03:08.690> the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
regeneration you could take it from the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.199 
regeneration you could take it from the
chunk<00:03:09.079> that's<00:03:09.829> just<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.160> other<00:03:10.370> will<00:03:10.549> check<00:03:11.090> i

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
chunk that's just the other will check i

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.740 
chunk that's just the other will check i
want<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.570> mention<00:03:11.690> set<00:03:13.390> usually<00:03:14.390> grapple

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
want to mention set usually grapple

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.810 
want to mention set usually grapple
regenerates<00:03:15.320> right<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.860> what<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.519> do<00:03:16.640> is

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
regenerates right here and what I do is

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.400 
regenerates right here and what I do is
I<00:03:18.220> actually<00:03:19.220> push<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.820> gravel<00:03:20.180> out<00:03:20.420> it's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
I actually push the gravel out it's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.319 
I actually push the gravel out it's
harvested<00:03:21.980> or<00:03:22.280> well<00:03:22.549> not<00:03:22.760> harbor<00:03:22.970> stupidest

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
harvested or well not harbor stupidest

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.870 
harvested or well not harbor stupidest
breaks<00:03:23.630> on<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.810> torch<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:24.680> yeah<00:03:25.549> goes

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
breaks on the torch and then yeah goes

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.520 
breaks on the torch and then yeah goes
up<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.120> line<00:03:26.299> here<00:03:26.540> back<00:03:26.720> into<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.079> chest<00:03:27.320> and

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
up the line here back into the chest and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.870 
up the line here back into the chest and
is<00:03:27.680> used<00:03:27.859> again<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:30.590> edit<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.160> yeah<00:03:31.579> just

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
is used again and it's edit so yeah just

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.289 
is used again and it's edit so yeah just
wanted<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.150> mention<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.480> couple<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.959> actual

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
wanted to mention a couple of the actual

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.080 
wanted to mention a couple of the actual
actual<00:03:35.829> like<00:03:36.829> tech<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.310> built<00:03:37.549> for<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:37.820> thing

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
actual like tech I built for this thing

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.960 
actual like tech I built for this thing
that<00:03:38.269> may<00:03:39.049> have<00:03:39.320> practical<00:03:40.010> use<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.400> chunk

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
that may have practical use of a chunk

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.340 
that may have practical use of a chunk
regeneration<00:03:41.570> ever<00:03:41.720> becomes<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.350> thing

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
regeneration ever becomes a thing

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.350 
regeneration ever becomes a thing
that's<00:03:45.350> about<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.830> then<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:46.250> just<00:03:46.940> have<00:03:47.150> the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
that's about it and then I just have the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.690 
that's about it and then I just have the
coal<00:03:47.930> smelting<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.500> iron<00:03:48.710> most<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.460> stuff
