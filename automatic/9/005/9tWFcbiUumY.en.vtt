00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello and welcome to josef 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.810
 inspiration i show you what currently 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 my favorite drink is and failed 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.090
 I make a very own recipe 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.410
 so not very strict after the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.059
 recipe but it really tastes great 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.719
 Good and that recipe I want with 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.960
 share you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:24.330
 you need a normal roche for this 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 so there are different and it seems 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.560
 I have tried this year and is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 really delicious then you need 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.630
 honey boiling water and milk and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.640
 my favorite cup my 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 favorite cup me big because I give 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.290
 there are two teabags purely on the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.290
 Tea bag boiling hot water 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.170
 and of course it has never happened to me 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.059
 but happened to me today 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.570
 just run the note 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.649
 like 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.930
 Of course you have to hold on tight 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:07.580
 because with something like that did not happen that way 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.820
 This t I leave now a first 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.460
 pull a few minutes and then it works 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.280
 continued after about five minutes 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.500
 I press the two tea bags out the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.030
 still a bit over the t as 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.050
 Next I give a big spoon 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:33.729
 Honey is a liquid honey 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.729
 That's why I had to do it all now 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.390
 be careful so and the whole thing is 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.100
 still very hot and now 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.640
 that's why this now with cold 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.890
 milk out and then it's direct 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.020
 very pleasant temperature you can do it 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.659
 drink directly I go so much now 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.850
 milk to up to a nice bright 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 Brown color gets it all the way 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.790
 Cash 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.549
 then you can try and if you can 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.080
 it still does not taste that way 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.539
 still not quite good you can still find 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.250
 a little milk to do more so I 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.849
 I have tasted really tastes good 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.769
 really good and you can still if 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.930
 give it a little sweetie 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.370
 honey wants that works well too 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.140
 the practical life in that I 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.060
 now the cold milk to have given 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.890
 and before that the boiling water is it 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.050
 now quite comfortable before the temperature 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.849
 but directly the whole drink 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.069
 I have such a huge cash register here 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.930
 That's why I had two teabags one 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.459
 Of course you can do it all in one 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.650
 small cup with only one teabag 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.269
 do 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 it's about two-thirds that way 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.299
 are and a third milk you can do that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.510
 yes try it out too 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.670
 I just have the tea in the drugstore 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.180
 bought so dm I bought the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.010
 and that was also very cheap milk 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.650
 one usually also at home and that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.910
 is really a really delicious drink 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.049
 maybe everybody tastes it 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.030
