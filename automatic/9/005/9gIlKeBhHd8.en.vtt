00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
right now we're at the grindelwald

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.560 
right now we're at the grindelwald
region<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.230> Switzerland<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.520> we're<00:01:54.030> taking

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
region of Switzerland and we're taking

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.160 
region of Switzerland and we're taking
reference<00:01:55.110> photos<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.920> mount<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.250> camera<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
reference photos we mount a camera to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.890 
reference photos we mount a camera to
tripod<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:59.100> panorama<00:01:59.880> head<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.420> panorama

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
tripod on a panorama head the panorama

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.380 
tripod on a panorama head the panorama
head<00:02:01.140> enables<00:02:01.680> us<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:01.860> take<00:02:02.520> pictures<00:02:02.940> in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
head enables us to take pictures in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.899 
head enables us to take pictures in
different<00:02:04.170> increments<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.070> multiple

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
different increments and multiple

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
different increments and multiple
exposures<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:07.140> stitch<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.710> together

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
exposures we stitch them all together

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.180 
exposures we stitch them all together
and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:08.880> an<00:02:09.149> HDR<00:02:09.780> nher<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:11.010> high

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and then we get an HDR nher is high

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.280 
and then we get an HDR nher is high
dynamic<00:02:11.400> range<00:02:11.730> image<00:02:12.239> each<00:02:12.600> frame<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.200> we

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
dynamic range image each frame that we

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.320 
dynamic range image each frame that we
do<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.769> at<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> multiple<00:02:14.340> exposure<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.120> when

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
do we do at a multiple exposure so when

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
do we do at a multiple exposure so when
you<00:02:15.450> stitch<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.840> all<00:02:15.930> together<00:02:16.110> later<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.860> can

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you stitch it all together later you can

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.780 
you stitch it all together later you can
slide<00:02:17.220> through<00:02:17.459> all<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.700> different

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
slide through all the different

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.390 
slide through all the different
exposures<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:18.930> from<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
exposures so you can go from the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.520 
exposures so you can go from the
darkseed<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.689> a<00:02:20.720> little<00:02:20.930> pinpoint<00:02:21.379> where

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
darkseed with a little pinpoint where

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.050 
darkseed with a little pinpoint where
the<00:02:21.560> sun<00:02:21.829> is<00:02:21.860> all<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.430> way<00:02:22.519> up<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.849> very

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
the sun is all the way up to a very

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.270 
the sun is all the way up to a very
exposed<00:02:23.510> image<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.709> way<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.010> gives<00:02:25.099> us

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
exposed image and that way it gives us

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.830 
exposed image and that way it gives us
the<00:02:25.430> full<00:02:25.579> range<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.000> play<00:02:26.209> with<00:02:26.420> when<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:26.689> go

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the full range to play with when we go

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.559 
the full range to play with when we go
to<00:02:26.870> make<00:02:27.110> our<00:02:27.260> sky<00:02:27.470> domes<00:02:27.680> later<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:29.420> have<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
to make our sky domes later we have a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.259 
to make our sky domes later we have a
pretty<00:02:29.959> long<00:02:30.230> production<00:02:30.950> cycle<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:31.790> probably

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
pretty long production cycle so probably

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.440 
pretty long production cycle so probably
about<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.989> year<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:34.250> full<00:02:34.489> production<00:02:34.849> once<00:02:35.209> we

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
about a year of full production once we

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.050 
about a year of full production once we
get<00:02:35.689> home<00:02:36.159> so<00:02:37.159> we<00:02:37.250> bring<00:02:37.459> back<00:02:37.609> all<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.849> our

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
get home so we bring back all of our

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.970 
get home so we bring back all of our
reference<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:38.959> start<00:02:39.230> modeling<00:02:39.739> rough

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
reference we start modeling rough

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.649 
reference we start modeling rough
landscapes<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:40.640> existed<00:02:41.180> there<00:02:41.329> so<00:02:41.510> they're

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
landscapes that existed there so they're

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.479 
landscapes that existed there so they're
fairly<00:02:41.870> accurate<00:02:42.379> but<00:02:42.500> we're<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.739> bound<00:02:43.099> to

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
fairly accurate but we're not bound to

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.119 
fairly accurate but we're not bound to
recreate<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.480> perfectly<00:02:45.409> as<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.650> exists

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
recreate it perfectly as it exists

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.069 
recreate it perfectly as it exists
because<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.549> isn't<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.819> track<00:02:47.030> there<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.689> we

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
because there isn't a track there so we

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.780 
because there isn't a track there so we
want<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.379> be<00:02:48.590> believable<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.340> needs<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.579> fit

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
want it to be believable it needs to fit

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.490 
want it to be believable it needs to fit
with<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> other<00:02:50.239> real<00:02:50.720> race<00:02:50.959> tracks<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.110 
with the other real race tracks in the
game<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.040> we<00:02:52.129> create<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> hook<00:02:52.519> back<00:02:52.700> stories

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.330 
game so we create a hook back stories

roads were built for workers and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.879 
roads were built for workers and
wintertime<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.659> in<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.019> rich<00:03:00.260> entrepreneur

wintertime and in this rich entrepreneur

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.860 
wintertime and in this rich entrepreneur
bought<00:03:01.579> it<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.000> tried<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:02.450> build<00:03:02.599> a<00:03:02.690> racetrack

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870

television screen they look the same we
found<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.930> way<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.079> basically

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
found a way to basically

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
reverse-engineer that at full HD

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.659 
reverse-engineer that at full HD

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
resolution on the xbox 360 so what we do

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.610 
resolution on the xbox 360 so what we do
is<00:03:49.699> we<00:03:49.909> captured<00:03:50.389> high<00:03:50.659> dynamic<00:03:50.870> range<00:03:51.109> images

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
is we captured high dynamic range images
