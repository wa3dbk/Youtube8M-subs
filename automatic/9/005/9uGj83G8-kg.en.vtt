00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 Video in which you have my opinion 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.269
 after quite interesting beginners dslr 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 Kombi set will unpack with you a lot 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 There is currently fun in the media market 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.250
 namely this combination in the offer that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.980
 not just a nikon d5100 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.349
 SLR camera and a tamron 18 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.560
 270 millimeter btw contains but also 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.140
 yet a matching 62 mm uv filter a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.000
 hdmi cable and a camera bag of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 nikon to be brief 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 You get everything you need to get in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 enter the world of dslr cameras 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 And it also saves a lot 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 money in this set only costs about 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.530
 750 euro during all parts included 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.899
 a total value of about 820 euros 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 So that's a savings from that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 about 70 euro let it ever 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.840
 a great thing if you are the big one 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.820
 box opens as actually jumps 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.859
 directly opposite the camera bag 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.400
 underneath you will find the box 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.240
 Nikon D5100 Buddies the HDMI cable 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.240
 the box of tamron 18 270 millimeters 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 Objective and the uv filter but dedicate 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.759
 let's first look at the d5100 itself 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 Under the top cardboard lid you will find 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 First, a lot of paperwork around the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 warranty and so on and so forth 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 below that are in the inception 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 style two more boxes in the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.570
 we find one quite stable 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.430
 nikon strap attaches to the man 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110
 the camera can tinker with it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.680
 hang out his inner tourist too 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 to let 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.140
 an av video cable an adapter piece for 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 the charger is a usb cable that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.979
 charger itself and still the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 Accompanying battery in the other it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.790
 besides the actual way in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.030
 surprisingly many before only papers 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.250
 wrapped d5100 camera then nothing 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.470
 further in the specification of the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.380
 By the way, the camera is playing in the upper one 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.750
 class of the beginner dslr with 16 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 megapixel and the possibility of full hd 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.890
 videos with 30 pictures the second 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.810
 everyone should be able to record 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.259
 beginner actually desireless happy 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 do 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.250
 but even such a good camera as 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.950
 d5100 it without any objective absolutely useless 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.960
 That's why we'll do it next time 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.520
 Once again we will unpack with 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.650
 a weird a weird 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.930
 paperwork it flooded as soon as we got 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.670
 the pack open under even more cardboard 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.740
 But then comes quite quickly right 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.600
 robust and heavy part to the fore 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.340
 I really like this place 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.780
 By the way, even a sun visor 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.480
 with the partie is natural 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.160
 on the one hand because of the protection from annoying 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.200
 light radiation from the side though 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 actually almost more at 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.610
 Just sunbathe and cool 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.070
 look professional the tamron 18 to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.840
 270 millimeter lens itself is for 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.150
 but such a beginner is already a 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.790
 most special baby most 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.640
 beginners dslr it will be namely with 18 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.380
 Up to 55 millimeter kit objective sale 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.210
 which are usually built quite cheap 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.790
 and very limited skills 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.680
 However, they have the advantage 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.750
 bring halfway to every area 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000
 to be usable the great thing about it 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.010
 tamron lens here is just that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 on the one hand the same advantage with the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.940
 flexibility and versatility 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.190
 but still has the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.620
 disadvantages of the quality of construction and the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.750
 limited zoom fixes and before 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.520
 all the downside with the xoom alone 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.050
 if you look at how mega 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.060
 long and big the part with one 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.580
 can be simple to handle the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.830
 tz should actually be clear that one 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.720
 here almost more looking for skill 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.090
 usually gets like that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.620
 will need to uv filter there 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.510
 not too much 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.550
 say because the part just nothing too 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.500
 special it is reduced stop 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.940
 annoying colors and raises the screen 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.430
 contrast and the sharpness of the picture 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.230
 while your objective at the same time 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.810
 and scratches is protected and 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.300
 of course, the hdmi cable stop that 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.709
 synonymous just a hdmi cable there can 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.720
 then just your camera to the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.820
 connect tv and pictures and 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.920
 Play photos on TV 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.930
 But let's get to the last one 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.970
 interesting part of the kids namely the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.160
 nikon camera bag that is actually 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.019
 processed quite well but now synonymous 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.550
 not really anything special 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.470
 the size, however, I think 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.260
 quite comfortable as that was enough space 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.330
 for the camera itself charging the 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.130
 uv filter some sd cards and 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.410
 possibly also a second one 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.000
 smaller lens offers without it 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.860
 To be truly enormous 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.720
 especially the velcro dividing wall stimulates 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.820
 just add that to yours 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.990
 place even better and can 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.030
 Please do not get me wrong now 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.160
 if your equipment keeps up with the times 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.800
 the bag will not grow any more 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.650
 But long vehicles are enough for that 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.510
 beginning the thing plc is at this point 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.460
 still short for all who ask me no 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.320
 the cameras do not mine and I will 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.900
 continue with my canon eos 600d 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.790
 stay that was it but already 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.440
 with this video at this point 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.450
 I thank you very much for a lot 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.280
 friendly spectators look over you 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.080
 little feedback on the comments 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.700
 or a like-button i would like 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.320
 In any case, very happy 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.120
 that 's it but as already mentioned 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.590
 this video i say goodbye and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.740
 I would say we'll see each other 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.740
 next
