00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
when they shout at you and you drop your

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
when they shout at you and you drop your
shit<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.310> don't<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.549> where<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.850> gone

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
shit and you don't know where it's gone

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149 
shit and you don't know where it's gone
exact<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:45.810> premise<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.530> when<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:46.920> fires

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
exact same premise or when he fires

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.910 
exact same premise or when he fires
those<00:01:47.460> three<00:01:48.119> projectiles<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.590> stay

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
those three projectiles if you stay

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
those three projectiles if you stay
where<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.149> move<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
where you are and then just move to the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.420 
where you are and then just move to the
right<00:01:51.689> or<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.079> left<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:52.950> dodge<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
right or the left you will dodge the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.039 
right or the left you will dodge the
middle<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.509> between<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
middle one and go in between that and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.980 
middle one and go in between that and
the<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.790> that's<00:01:56.790> furthest<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:57.540> or

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the one that's furthest to the right or

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.649 
the one that's furthest to the right or
left<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:59.159> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> challenging<00:02:00.270> at

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
left so it's kind of challenging at

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.959 
left so it's kind of challenging at
times<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.110> evade<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.829> when<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
times to evade but when you see it a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
times to evade but when you see it a
couple<00:02:03.000> times<00:02:03.719> when<00:02:03.930> he<00:02:03.990> fires<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.439> yet

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
couple times when he fires it out yet

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.050 
couple times when he fires it out yet
you<00:02:04.860> shouldn't<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.340> too<00:02:05.549> much<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.850> an<00:02:05.939> issue

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you shouldn't have too much of an issue

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.240 
you shouldn't have too much of an issue
you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.750> stepping<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.560> way<00:02:07.799> but

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you know stepping out of this way but

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
you know stepping out of this way but
there<00:02:08.700> he<00:02:08.819> goes<00:02:09.030> he<00:02:09.270> goes<00:02:09.300> down<00:02:09.599> pretty

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
there he goes he goes down pretty

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.029 
there he goes he goes down pretty
quickly<00:02:10.080> once<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> know<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:10.770> doing

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
quickly once you know what you're doing

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
quickly once you know what you're doing
and<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.239> end<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> level

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and so that is the end of the level

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.690 
and so that is the end of the level
