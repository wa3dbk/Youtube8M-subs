00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
alright so this little system here i can

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.390 
alright so this little system here i can
really<00:00:18.930> only<00:00:19.140> think<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.590> 1awesome<00:00:19.920> use

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
really only think of like 1awesome use

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.470 
really only think of like 1awesome use
for<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.789> okay<00:00:20.970> um<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:23.939> beyond<00:00:24.269> would

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
for it okay um the use for beyond would

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.460 
for it okay um the use for beyond would
be<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.350> example<00:00:26.840> if<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.320> some

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
be if for example if you have like some

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.169 
be if for example if you have like some
kind<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.710> branch<00:00:28.949> mine<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.760> your

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
kind of branch mine right and your

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.669 
kind of branch mine right and your
branch<00:00:30.390> mining<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.960> there's<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> buddy

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
branch mining and there's like a buddy

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
branch mining and there's like a buddy
up<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.219> he<00:00:32.309> threw<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:32.850> torches<00:00:33.239> or

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
up there and he threw some torches or

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.080 
up there and he threw some torches or
something<00:00:33.950> he<00:00:34.950> needed<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.489> something<00:00:35.730> up

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
something he needed to get something up

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750 
something he needed to get something up
to<00:00:36.420> him<00:00:36.660> okay<00:00:37.350> doesn't<00:00:38.250> look<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> hundred

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to him okay doesn't look a hundred

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
to him okay doesn't look a hundred
percent<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.469> you'll<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.649> where

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
percent of the time you'll know where

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
percent of the time you'll know where
it's<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.160> working<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.120> does<00:00:42.300> work<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's not working but it does work it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
it's not working but it does work it
does<00:00:43.079> work<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.530> basically<00:00:43.620> takes<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.160> couple

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
does work so it basically takes a couple

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.650 
does work so it basically takes a couple
of<00:00:44.489> tries<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.000> either<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.270> go<00:00:45.390> all<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
of tries so it's either you go all the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.000 
of tries so it's either you go all the
way<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:46.739> hand<00:00:46.890> them

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
way up there to you don't hand them

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.299 
way up there to you don't hand them
something<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.320> trick<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
something or you do this trick so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.770 
something or you do this trick so
basically<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.879> ladders<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> would

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
basically you have ladders and you would

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.299 
basically you have ladders and you would
have<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> Miss<00:00:52.199> highest<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.100> go

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
have a Miss highest you're gonna go

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
have a Miss highest you're gonna go
let's<00:00:53.820> pretend<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.750> over

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
let's pretend this is that you know over

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
let's pretend this is that you know over
world<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.250> you're<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.000> mining<00:00:57.420> around

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
world and you're down here mining around

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
world and you're down here mining around
at<00:00:57.930> level<00:00:58.230> 12<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:58.949> something<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.969> example

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
at level 12 or something so for example

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.990 
at level 12 or something so for example
you<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.690> rid<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> ladders

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
you would get rid of one of the ladders

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
you would get rid of one of the ladders
you<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.120> place<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.510> item<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.199> rest

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you would place an item to little rest

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
you would place an item to little rest
on<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.920> hitbox<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> see

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
on this little hitbox right here you see

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.260 
on this little hitbox right here you see
that<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> black<00:01:06.689> lines<00:01:07.729> like<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> then

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that the black lines like so and then

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
that the black lines like so and then
you<00:01:10.110> place<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> ladder<00:01:12.710> okay<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:13.950> what

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you place a ladder okay you see what

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.899 
you place a ladder okay you see what
it's<00:01:14.220> doing<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:16.220> elevated<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.700> up

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it's doing there it elevated it it up

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's doing there it elevated it it up
there<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.810> normally<00:01:19.320> actually<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> was

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
there now normally actually this was

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
there now normally actually this was
pretty<00:01:20.220> sweet<00:01:20.400> normally<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> doesn't<00:01:21.570> just

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pretty sweet normally it doesn't just

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.469 
pretty sweet normally it doesn't just
put<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> nearest<00:01:23.040> block<00:01:23.479> okay

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
put it on the nearest block okay

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
put it on the nearest block okay
normally<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> does<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
normally what it does is you can see it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
normally what it does is you can see it
actually<00:01:26.670> jumping<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.320> it'll<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:28.829> here

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually jumping I so it'll go from here

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
actually jumping I so it'll go from here
to<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> won't<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> able<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to up there and but you won't be able to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.999 
to up there and but you won't be able to
pick<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.990> down<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.619> try<00:01:31.829> one

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
pick it up down here so let's try one

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
pick it up down here so let's try one
more<00:01:32.159> time<00:01:32.299> press<00:01:33.299> our<00:01:33.509> luck<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:34.020> didn't

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
more time press our luck that didn't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.660 
more time press our luck that didn't
really<00:01:34.350> work<00:01:37.009> okay<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.340 

you<00:01:41.299> know<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:41.750> going<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.960> work<00:01:42.170> when

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
you know that it's going to work when

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.410 
you know that it's going to work when
it's<00:01:42.470> kind<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.740> jumping<00:01:43.189> like<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.610> but<00:01:44.330> you

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
it's kind of jumping like that but you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.539 
it's kind of jumping like that but you
see<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.320> if<00:01:45.439> we<00:01:45.590> look<00:01:45.619> up<00:01:45.920> here<00:01:46.189> it's<00:01:46.369> up
