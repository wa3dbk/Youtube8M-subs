to it in terms of shape so someone with

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
to it in terms of shape so someone with
a<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.850> sort<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.119> oval<00:01:57.540> head<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.960> found<00:01:58.560> there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a more sort of oval head I found there

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
a more sort of oval head I found there
was<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> lot<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> pressure<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.030> front<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.450> my

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
was a lot of pressure on the front of my

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.240 
was a lot of pressure on the front of my
head<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> jet<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.710> there's<00:02:01.860> none<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
head with a jet but there's none of that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.859 
head with a jet but there's none of that
in<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.299> would<00:02:03.479> suit<00:02:03.689> all

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
in this one I think this would suit all

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.330 
in this one I think this would suit all
head<00:02:04.200> shapes<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.310> really

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
head shapes and that's a really really

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.249 
head shapes and that's a really really
hard<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.210> brand<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> achieve<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
hard thing for a brand to achieve so I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.809 
hard thing for a brand to achieve so I
think<00:02:07.350> Davido<00:02:07.710> need<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> big<00:02:08.520> round<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
think Davido need a big round of

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.400 
think Davido need a big round of
