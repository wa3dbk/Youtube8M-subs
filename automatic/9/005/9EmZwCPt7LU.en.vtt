hey everyone we're down here in the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.019 
hey everyone we're down here in the
basement<00:00:06.370> we're<00:00:07.370> in<00:00:07.460> the<00:00:07.550> basement<00:00:07.729> because

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
basement we're in the basement because

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.270 
basement we're in the basement because
this<00:00:08.360> is<00:00:08.480> where<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:08.840> cable<00:00:09.290> comes<00:00:09.500> in<00:00:09.680> for<00:00:10.040> the

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
this is where the cable comes in for the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.400 
this is where the cable comes in for the
cable<00:00:10.580> modem<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:11.120> this<00:00:11.450> is<00:00:11.570> where<00:00:11.719> I<00:00:11.750> have<00:00:12.110> the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
cable modem and this is where I have the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.459 
cable modem and this is where I have the
internet<00:00:12.980> hardware<00:00:13.339> setup<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:13.999> just<00:00:14.660> easier

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
internet hardware setup it's just easier

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.470 
internet hardware setup it's just easier
that<00:00:15.530> way<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.070> instead<00:00:16.760> of<00:00:16.850> disconnecting

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
that way and instead of disconnecting

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.670 
that way and instead of disconnecting
the<00:00:18.190> Xtreme<00:00:19.360> wireless<00:00:20.360> router<00:00:20.630> I<00:00:20.780> decided<00:00:21.290> to

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
the Xtreme wireless router I decided to

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.340 
the Xtreme wireless router I decided to
just<00:00:22.160> show<00:00:22.460> it<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:22.810> working<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:23.900> real<00:00:24.080> time

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
just show it to you working in real time

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.050 
just show it to you working in real time
a<00:00:24.650> lot<00:00:24.860> easier<00:00:25.190> than<00:00:25.340> disconnecting<00:00:25.880> all<00:00:25.970> the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
a lot easier than disconnecting all the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.120 
a lot easier than disconnecting all the
cables<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:26.510> shutting<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:26.930> down<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.980> cable

have a web server an FTP server you can

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.010 
have a web server an FTP server you can
map<00:02:07.549> those<00:02:07.759> ports<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.300> IP<00:02:08.450> addresses<00:02:08.869> of

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
map those ports so the IP addresses of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.840 
map those ports so the IP addresses of
those<00:02:09.259> computers

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850

set<00:02:39.460> up<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:39.790> encryption<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.320> you're

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
set up your encryption and then you're

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.320 
set up your encryption and then you're
done<00:02:41.650> again<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.610> took<00:02:42.760> less<00:02:42.970> than<00:02:43.150> five

can do with other routers you won't be
able<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.009> do<00:04:32.129> that<00:04:32.280> with<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.759> minor<00:04:33.629> drawback

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
able to do that with this minor drawback

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.619

if you're running this at home there's

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.080 
if you're running this at home there's

if you're running this in an enterprise

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.800 
if you're running this in an enterprise
environment<00:04:41.129> then<00:04:41.849> you<00:04:41.879> you<00:04:42.270> might<00:04:42.449> want<00:04:42.659> that

environment then you you might want that

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.409 
environment then you you might want that
feature<00:04:43.020> but<00:04:43.349> again<00:04:43.650> it's<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.789> it's<00:04:45.330> a

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
feature but again it's it's a it's a

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.050 
feature but again it's it's a it's a
minor<00:04:45.629> drawback<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.379> the<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.400> utility

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
minor drawback of the the utility

minor drawback of the the utility
software<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.750> nice<00:04:51.960> feature<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.439> the<00:04:52.560> USB

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
software and a nice feature of the USB

software and a nice feature of the USB
2.0<00:04:53.550> connection<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.539> have<00:04:54.689> a<00:04:54.719> mass

individual password for that storage

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.459 
individual password for that storage
device<00:05:04.529> which<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.580> really<00:05:05.759> nice<00:05:05.939> so<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.300> can

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
device which is really nice so you can

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.170 
device which is really nice so you can
have<00:05:07.469> one<00:05:07.680> client<00:05:07.949> that<00:05:08.099> can<00:05:08.430> access<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:09.029> and
