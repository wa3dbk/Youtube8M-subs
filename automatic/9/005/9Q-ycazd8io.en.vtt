00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.380
 the door of his verse greece inside the liquidators you go 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.859
 distinguish several categories of fatty acids 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.159
 fatty acids are fats circulating in the blood 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.029
 we distinguish the good fatty acids so-called fatty acids 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.310
 polyunsaturated and monounsaturated 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.170
 it's the fatty acids that do not know us because they're not going to 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.269
 combine them to hang on the walls of our arteries 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.530
 there are less good fatty acids that are saturated fatty acids 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.530
 whose particularity will be to attach to our arteries 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.540
 In fact, they could be clogged up and cause incidents as serious as 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.130
 cardiovascular illnesses 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.410
 and then a few years ago we discovered a category of fatty acids 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 which is called trans fatty acids which are now banned in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.930
 many a lot of countries because these fatty acids have for particularity not 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 only to participate in raising cholesterol but in addition to increasing the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.950
 bad part of cholesterol and in addition to lowering the party 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 good of this cholesterol what makes these fatty acids France have become 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.410
 bombs both dangerous to our health and also participating in the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.810
 energy movement so that means they have to be excluded 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 these trans fatty acids are found in their natural state in the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 league 2 dairy products for this rank in deli meats and meats 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.440
 beauville 3 of 8 3% but we find them unfortunately in most 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.870
 hydrogenated fats where the industrial greases that are used to 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.470
 reasons of ease and economy that's why wanted to find 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 hidden form in the dishes prepared in the biscuits and in 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.980
 everything has not produced 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 how to be wary look on the labels here figure the mention acids 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.050
 trans fat but at that time you will know the dosage that the product 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.980
 contains and if it does not appear on the label then searched if you do not 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.360
 do not see the word hydrogenated or partially 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.110
 hydrogenated because in these fats you are not pressured into 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.870
 find 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.120
 finally you are not too afraid either you should not eat more than six 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.850
 oars at 8 grams a day so that's something that's hard 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.780
 to be on terms of being a big fan of a biscuit trail or 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.760
 products rich in fatty acids 30 French legislation has nothing planned 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.470
 today but no discouragement it happens in a few months so you 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.310
 can live quiet watch anyway during that time at 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 soon good appetite
