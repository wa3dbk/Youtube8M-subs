both the red and green possibly that are
lighting<00:01:53.050> up<00:01:53.170> for<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> flash<00:01:54.009> on<00:01:54.220> clash<00:01:54.550> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
lighting up for the flash on clash and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.920 
lighting up for the flash on clash and
