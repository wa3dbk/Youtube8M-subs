show<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.500> proper<00:00:04.950> way<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.390> complete<00:00:06.390> a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
show you the proper way to complete a

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.789 
show you the proper way to complete a
barrel<00:00:06.750> pattern<00:00:07.109> we're<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.529> go<00:00:07.620> both

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
barrel pattern we're going to go both

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.100 
barrel pattern we're going to go both
left<00:00:08.370> first<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.880> then<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.389> right<00:00:09.570> first<00:00:09.900> so

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
left first and then to right first so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.749 
left first and then to right first so
that<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> vision<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.280> each<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.639> those

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that you have a vision of each of those

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.089 
that you have a vision of each of those
we're<00:00:12.269> also<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.809> talk<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
we're also going to talk about the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.550 
we're also going to talk about the
proper<00:00:14.670> way<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.820> approach<00:00:15.269> each<00:00:15.509> barrel<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
proper way to approach each barrel to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.870 
proper way to approach each barrel to
slow<00:00:16.740> down<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> barrel<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
slow down for the barrel and the to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.090 
slow down for the barrel and the to
accelerate<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> talk<00:00:19.949> about

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
accelerate we are going to talk about

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800 
accelerate we are going to talk about
some<00:00:20.369> terms<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> use

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
some terms that that we're going to use

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
some terms that that we're going to use
the<00:00:21.990> rest<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.470> these<00:00:22.769> videos<00:00:23.189> also<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the rest of these videos also one of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
the rest of these videos also one of
them<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.539> approach<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.039> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
them is approach that's the way that you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
them is approach that's the way that you
come<00:00:26.400> into<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> barrel<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.320> approach

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
come into the barrel in that approach

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.839 
come into the barrel in that approach
you<00:00:28.650> need<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.039> make<00:00:29.189> sure<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.699> leave

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
you need to make sure that you leave

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
you need to make sure that you leave
what's<00:00:30.090> called<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> pocket<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.560> some

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
what's called a pocket and that's some

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.350 
what's called a pocket and that's some
room<00:00:32.070> around<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.640> barrel<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.210> allow

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
room around the barrel that will allow

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
room around the barrel that will allow
your<00:00:33.510> horse<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> turn<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.950> we're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
your horse to turn it so we're going to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.830 
your horse to turn it so we're going to
be<00:00:35.340> talking<00:00:35.550> about<00:00:35.670> pocket<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
be talking about pocket a lot and that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
be talking about pocket a lot and that
just<00:00:37.020> means<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> space<00:00:37.680> between<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.250> horse

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
just means the space between the horse

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
just means the space between the horse
and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> barrel<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and the barrel and then we're going to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560 
and the barrel and then we're going to
be<00:00:40.469> talking<00:00:40.770> about<00:00:41.070> inside<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.360> outside

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
be talking about inside and outside

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
be talking about inside and outside
reins<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.649> feet<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> need<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
reins and feet so you need to know that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
reins and feet so you need to know that
an<00:00:44.940> inside<00:00:45.480> rein<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.860> turning

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
an inside rein is when you are turning

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.049 
an inside rein is when you are turning
to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> right

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to the right

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.029 
to the right
the<00:00:48.420> inside<00:00:48.930> rein<00:00:49.200> would<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.770> rein

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the inside rein would be your right rein

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.500 
the inside rein would be your right rein
your<00:00:50.309> inside<00:00:50.640> foot<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.329> foot

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
your inside foot with your right foot

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.979 
your inside foot with your right foot
the<00:00:52.469> outside<00:00:53.270> conversely<00:00:54.270> would<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.690> your

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the outside conversely would be your

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.350 
the outside conversely would be your
left<00:00:55.230> hand<00:00:55.710> left<00:00:56.190> foot<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.030> we'll<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> talking

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
left hand left foot so we'll be talking

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
left hand left foot so we'll be talking
about<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.930> you'll<00:00:58.079> need<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> term

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
about that you'll need to know that term

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.529 
about that you'll need to know that term
and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.430> we're<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> talk<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and then we're going to talk about the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
and then we're going to talk about the
acceleration<00:01:00.870> point<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> point<00:01:01.980> after<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
acceleration point the point after you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.399 
acceleration point the point after you
get<00:01:03.180> finished<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.809> turn<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> you're

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
get finished with your turn that you're

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.020 
get finished with your turn that you're
going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.680> turn<00:01:04.860> your<00:01:05.010> horse<00:01:05.159> loose<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> allow

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
going to turn your horse loose and allow

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
going to turn your horse loose and allow
them<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> accelerate<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.080> head<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> next

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
them to accelerate and head to the next

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
them to accelerate and head to the next
barrel<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.760> those<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.210> terms<00:01:09.450> you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
barrel so those are some terms you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
barrel so those are some terms you're
going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.900> need<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.320> complete<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> next

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
going to need as we complete this next

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
going to need as we complete this next
segment<00:01:11.610> we're<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> start<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.140> barrel

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
segment we're going to start this barrel

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.039 
segment we're going to start this barrel
pattern<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:14.060> right<00:01:15.060> between<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> first<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
pattern out right between the first and

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
pattern out right between the first and
the<00:01:16.140> second<00:01:16.560> barrel<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> need<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> envision<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the second barrel you need to envision a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
the second barrel you need to envision a
straight<00:01:18.360> line<00:01:18.780> between<00:01:19.049> those<00:01:19.409> first<00:01:19.680> two

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
straight line between those first two

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560 
straight line between those first two
barrels<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.640> head<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
barrels so that you can head up like it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.010 
barrels so that you can head up like it
we're<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.869> imaginary<00:01:22.350> alley<00:01:22.619> until<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.580> get

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
we're an imaginary alley until you get

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.969 
we're an imaginary alley until you get
close<00:01:25.020> enough<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.409> you're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> make

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
close enough that you're going to make

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
close enough that you're going to make
sort<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.460> arc<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.090> around<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.420> first

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
