00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.580
 hello my life spectators today there are 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.920
 a piling on me and that's because I'm at 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.480
 ikea and as you know, I rather love 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.730
 and that's why I have a few there 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.460
 bought things and they just want 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.349
 show it and you do that then 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.579
 Let's start with the video first 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.860
 things I bought 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.920
 is this here and this is such a tray 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.239
 and I want so much I know about new 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.309
 make jersey cows on it 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.800
 and yes that is so you can of course 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.329
 also eat or even make up as 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.399
 I have to take a breakfast tray 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.730
 I'll probably do that as a dÃ©co 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.710
 Use tray and tablet at the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 the ikea tree is now on the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:01:00.400
 German 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:04.479
 somehow makes a pillowcase 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.450
 that's 50 50 and is the same pattern 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.490
 like a duvet cover and I thought 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 that fits quite well and likes 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.360
 At Coop, having a pillow is easy 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.749
 which has no relation to the times 50 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.969
 50 and that he cost two euros 99 as 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:22.359
 Next I'll have this here 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.759
 fetched and that is simply first, 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.689
 such a lampshade, yes, I believe 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.520
 that is lampshade 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.609
 and yes the mega pretty and I have 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.310
 with your head - and you want to go behind 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.069
 bought therefore therefore 12 euro cost 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.770
 So you are set up when you are 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.819
 know that mainz and that has four euros 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.299
 tasted and I found that you now and 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.840
 I've also had that in the ikea 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.429
 completely seen 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:56.469
 I think that means I started to 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:02:02.049
 secure and continue with a field 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:04.179
 carpet of soy carpets invites 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.920
 Looks like this now and I already have 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.649
 a lot of them all in all but me 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 just take it that's why I can 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.170
 do not buy enough and they will 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.550
 also sometimes dirty and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.319
 who is not so pretty anymore that we 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:24.970
 have bought a new one that is mega and 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.970
 yes it I bought the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.510
 I bought candles and candles 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.180
 are just such tealight candles 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:44.870
 and use it here I know 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:50.510
 not how much that does not matter now 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.069
 I estimate that 190 and that 10 500 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.500
 piece and we'll give you all the time 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.870
 that's why I like the tealights 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.480
 got me 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.100
 Of course, that's very unspectacular 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.500
 Such lamps lead my lamps and 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.120
 yes then here's another five men cover 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.980
 boring broken is already 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.720
 out of the bag just one more thing 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.430
 quite and yes I was very short was yes 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.470
 that I have to do it now and I have to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.650
 always lift high because similar structure 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.650
 is 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.599
 this is her head and hewn 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:46.750
 a floor lamp yes I think that's what it means 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.750
 yes that's called astrid costs 39 euro 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.220
 that and maybe I will 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.260
 again, probably more likely 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.310
 Not 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.959
 yes, sometimes I do not know that 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.370
 I will have to assemble 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.010
 look I have you here somewhere 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.310
 Blender or you will not yes 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.310
 then definitely look the same way 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.250
 longer video with and I have it 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.470
 now at this time 9600 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.900
 thank subscribers for that 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.850
 and therefore a big heart for you 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.950
 and yes its that short again 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.220
 but has become so until the next 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.220
 times
