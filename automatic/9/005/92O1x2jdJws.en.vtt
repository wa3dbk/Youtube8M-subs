to<00:00:04.319> make<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> quick<00:00:05.100> video<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.730> show<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.000> bit

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
to make a quick video to show a bit

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.830 
to make a quick video to show a bit
about<00:00:06.720> how<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.589> works

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
about how it works

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.360 
about how it works
doing<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.929> quick<00:00:10.170> example<00:00:10.530> will<00:00:10.830> second

doing a quick example will second

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.780 
doing a quick example will second
talking<00:00:12.300> about<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.230> why<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.190> might<00:00:14.549> work

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
talking about how and why it might work

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
talking about how and why it might work
and<00:00:15.059> then<00:00:15.509> little<00:00:15.750> more<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.800> quickly<00:00:16.980> review

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
start remembering that there's it's done

so<00:00:46.860> here's<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> infinite<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.879> Sentinel

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.810 

drop<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.410> last<00:00:57.590> link<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.070> right<00:00:58.250> there<00:00:58.489> with

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
drop the last link it right there with

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.130 
drop the last link it right there with
that<00:00:58.940> comma<00:00:59.210> could<00:00:59.480> go<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.809> indefinitely<00:01:00.079> or

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
that comma could go on indefinitely or

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:12.340 
that comma could go on indefinitely or
until<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.290> know<00:01:03.440> find<00:01:04.010> fists<00:01:04.250> eyes

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.420 

so<00:01:13.350> explain<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> bit<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.520> why<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:16.049> works<00:01:16.430> if

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so explain a bit about why this works if

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.789 
so explain a bit about why this works if
you<00:01:17.610> take<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> look<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.259> when

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you take a look here what if when

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.630 
you take a look here what if when
Sentinel<00:01:20.460> hits<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.060> character<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> hair

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
Sentinel hits a character with the hair

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
Sentinel hits a character with the hair
heavy<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.810> soon<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.170> he<00:01:25.320> lands<00:01:25.830> there's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
heavy right as soon as he lands there's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.870 
heavy right as soon as he lands there's
this<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.909> weird<00:01:27.600> pause<00:01:28.759> where<00:01:29.759> you're

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
this little weird pause where you're

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.550 
this little weird pause where you're
just<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> standing<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> I'm

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
just kind of standing there and I'm

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440 
just kind of standing there and I'm
pretty<00:01:31.830> sure<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.220> either<00:01:32.640> his<00:01:33.030> landing

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
pretty sure that's either his landing

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.730 
pretty sure that's either his landing
animation<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.320> his<00:01:34.619> jumping<00:01:35.250> animation<00:01:36.740> but

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
animation or his jumping animation but

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
animation or his jumping animation but
whenever<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.220> jump<00:01:38.460> normally<00:01:39.060> there's<00:01:39.869> none

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
whenever you jump normally there's none

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.330 
whenever you jump normally there's none
of<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.799> freeze<00:01:41.179> it's<00:01:42.179> very<00:01:42.539> short

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
of that little freeze it's very short

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.910 
of that little freeze it's very short
what<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> happening<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.800> when<00:01:46.800> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
what I think is happening is when you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.029 
what I think is happening is when you
hit<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.190> character<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.470> end<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
hit a character with just a very end of

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.300 
hit a character with just a very end of
that<00:01:50.580> air<00:01:51.360> heavy<00:01:51.720> or<00:01:52.080> rather<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.190> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that air heavy or rather the start of it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.210 
that air heavy or rather the start of it
as<00:01:53.490> soon<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.819> he<00:01:53.909> hit<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.179> ground<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
as soon as he hit the ground then the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.149 
as soon as he hit the ground then the
game<00:01:56.429> never<00:01:56.700> thinks<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.330> touch<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> ground

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
game never thinks you touch the ground

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.950 
game never thinks you touch the ground
so<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.429> continues<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> ignore<00:02:00.390> hitstun

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so it continues to ignore hitstun

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
so it continues to ignore hitstun
scaling<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.920> neither<00:02:02.460> character<00:02:02.909> has

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
scaling because neither character has

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
scaling because neither character has
touched<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.420> ground<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:03.990> still<00:02:04.319> thinks

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
touched the ground so it still thinks

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.949 
touched the ground so it still thinks
you're<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> team<00:02:05.220> air<00:02:05.369> time<00:02:11.720> I've<00:02:12.720> been

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
you're in the team air time I've been

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.750 
you're in the team air time I've been
desperately<00:02:13.590> trying<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:14.130> figure<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.459> how<00:02:14.730> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
desperately trying to figure out how to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.330 
desperately trying to figure out how to
do<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.269> with<00:02:15.510> zero<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:17.040> should<00:02:17.310> work

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
do this with zero and it should work

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.400 
do this with zero and it should work
because<00:02:17.940> while<00:02:18.239> there's<00:02:18.510> nothing<00:02:18.840> zero<00:02:18.989> can't

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
because while there's nothing zero can't

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.319 
because while there's nothing zero can't
do<00:02:21.500> but<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.799> bit<00:02:22.980> difficult<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.700> seems<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
do but it's a bit difficult it seems I

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.990 
do but it's a bit difficult it seems I
haven't<00:02:24.720> figured<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> good<00:02:25.560> way<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:26.760> set<00:02:26.970> up

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
haven't figured out a good way to set up

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.740 
haven't figured out a good way to set up
an<00:02:27.209> infinite<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.870> him

people think that it's going to be

that infinite but if you utilize things

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.180 
that infinite but if you utilize things

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380
