00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
a nice setup

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.820 
a nice setup
and<00:00:29.939> open<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.510> we've<00:00:31.140> also<00:00:31.320> installed<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and open that up we've also installed a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.209 
and open that up we've also installed a
bed<00:00:32.009> slide<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:34.260> slides<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.710> handy<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.100> you're

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
bed slide the slides are handy if you're

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.500 
bed slide the slides are handy if you're
not<00:00:35.340> familiar<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> bed<00:00:36.059> slide<00:00:36.329> they're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
not familiar with the bed slide they're

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
not familiar with the bed slide they're
really<00:00:36.750> nice<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> actually<00:00:37.320> put<00:00:37.649> them

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
really nice you can actually put them

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
really nice you can actually put them
into<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> bed<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:39.360> they<00:00:39.480> actually

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
into the bed and then they actually

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.350 
into the bed and then they actually
slide<00:00:40.170> out

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
slide out

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
slide out
so<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.450> you've<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.920> items<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.129> heavy

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
so if you've got items that are heavy

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.529 
so if you've got items that are heavy
and<00:00:44.579> hard<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> back

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and hard to get in and out of the back

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.850 
and hard to get in and out of the back
of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> truck<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> bed<00:00:46.230> slide<00:00:46.500> actually

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
of the truck the bed slide actually

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
of the truck the bed slide actually
slides<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> lock<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.820> several<00:00:48.180> different

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
slides and lock in several different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.979 
slides and lock in several different
positions<00:00:50.270> comes<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> back

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
positions comes all the way to the back

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.420 
positions comes all the way to the back
so<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.739> sticking<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> back

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so right now it's sticking out the back

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360 
so right now it's sticking out the back
of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> truck<00:00:53.850> probably<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:55.100> three<00:00:56.100> four

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
of the truck probably about three four

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
of the truck probably about three four
feet<00:00:56.610> past<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> tailgate<00:00:57.750> gives<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.350> plenty

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
feet past the tailgate gives you plenty

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
feet past the tailgate gives you plenty

of storage on top typically they have a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
of storage on top typically they have a
rating<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.109> make<00:01:01.260> two<00:01:01.410> different<00:01:01.559> models

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
rating they make two different models

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
rating they make two different models
the<00:01:02.489> base<00:01:02.910> model<00:01:02.940> has<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> 1200<00:01:03.690> pound<00:01:03.960> rating

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.590 
removed if you don't want it in there
all<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.180> simple

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
all the time it's a very simple

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
all the time it's a very simple
procedure<00:01:29.119> lock<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.479> point<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.310> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
procedure lock at that point so at this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.830 
procedure lock at that point so at this
point<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.090> about<00:01:33.450> even<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
