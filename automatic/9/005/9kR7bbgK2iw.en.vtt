00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to mount this to the ceiling the easiest

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.270 
to mount this to the ceiling the easiest
way<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.320> lay<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.650> track<00:01:19.979> down

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
way to do this is to lay your track down

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
way to do this is to lay your track down
on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> floor<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.270> way<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.689> give<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
on the floor that way it will give you a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.300 
on the floor that way it will give you a
good<00:01:22.200> idea<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> up

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
good idea of how you want to put it up

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
good idea of how you want to put it up
on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> ceiling<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.479> trucks<00:01:24.780> come<00:01:25.020> in

on the ceiling the trucks come in
varying<00:01:25.650> links<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.220> we're<00:01:26.369> using<00:01:26.580> eight<00:01:26.970> feet

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
varying links but we're using eight feet

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
varying links but we're using eight feet
in<00:01:27.420> four<00:01:27.930> feet<00:01:28.140> sections<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.549> need

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
in four feet sections now what we need

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
in four feet sections now what we need
to<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> ceiling<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to do is go up on the ceiling and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.420 
to do is go up on the ceiling and
measure<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.650> marked<00:01:31.979> where<00:01:32.159> we're<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.369> to

ledge so here's another accessory that
you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.080> get<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.070> called<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.370> flexible

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
you can get this is called a flexible

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.210 
you can get this is called a flexible
elbow<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:39.840> just<00:03:40.230> slides<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.739> snaps<00:03:41.010> in

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
elbow this just slides and snaps in

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.310 
elbow this just slides and snaps in
place<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> flexible<00:03:42.780> elbow<00:03:43.170> you

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
place and with the flexible elbow you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.900 
place and with the flexible elbow you
could<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> 90<00:03:44.010> degree<00:03:44.250> angle<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.790> can

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
could do a 90 degree angle and you can

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.930 
could do a 90 degree angle and you can
also<00:03:45.120> do<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> 45<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.950> let<00:03:47.100> me<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.370> put<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.730> up

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
also do a 45 so let me just put this up

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.520 
also do a 45 so let me just put this up
here<00:03:47.970> make<00:03:48.300> sure<00:03:48.330> it's<00:03:48.600> long<00:03:48.840> enough<00:03:49.230> well

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
here make sure it's long enough well

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.220 
here make sure it's long enough well
actually<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:50.880> too<00:03:51.150> long<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.870> won't<00:03:52.020> be

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
actually it's too long but that won't be

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.990 
actually it's too long but that won't be
a<00:03:52.260> problem<00:03:52.320> all<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:52.980> need<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.280> do<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.520> just<00:03:53.700> mark

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
the junction of these two pieces but

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.410 
the junction of these two pieces but
actually<00:03:59.100> you'll<00:03:59.250> want<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.520> cut<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.970> about<00:04:00.180> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
quarter of an inch shorter so that you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.380 
quarter of an inch shorter so that you
have<00:04:02.550> room<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.910> slide<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.330> on<00:04:04.970> before<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.180> make

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
have room to slide it on before I make

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.449 
have room to slide it on before I make
the<00:04:06.540> cut<00:04:06.780> I'm<00:04:06.989> using<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.410> speed<00:04:07.739> square<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:08.340> mark

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
the cut I'm using a speed square to mark

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.550 
the cut I'm using a speed square to mark
both<00:04:08.790> sides<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.390> track<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:10.200> will<00:04:10.410> give

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
both sides of the track this will give

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.620 
both sides of the track this will give
me<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> straight<00:04:11.100> line<00:04:11.370> for<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.670> square<00:04:11.970> cut<00:04:12.269> and

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
me a straight line for a square cut and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.110 
me a straight line for a square cut and
instead<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.440> using<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.739> sawhorse<00:04:13.980> I'm<00:04:14.610> using<00:04:14.910> my

need<00:04:37.629> at<00:04:37.750> least<00:04:37.780> two<00:04:38.289> holes<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.889> this<00:04:39.009> track<00:04:39.460> so

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
need at least two holes in this track so

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.820 
need at least two holes in this track so
that<00:04:39.759> I<00:04:39.849> can<00:04:40.060> mount<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:40.449> to<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:40.810> ceiling<00:04:41.229> you

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:49.689 
another hole at this end the mounted to

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.249 
another hole at this end the mounted to
the<00:04:49.750> ceiling<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:52.120> looks<00:04:52.419> about<00:04:52.599> right<00:04:52.750> right

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
the ceiling that looks about right right

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:59.820 
the ceiling that looks about right right
there<00:04:58.409> all<00:04:59.409> right

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830

this piece fits and I've got it secured
into<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.870> ceiling<00:05:02.259> now<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:02.860> got<00:05:03.099> really<00:05:03.520> lucky

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.429 
into the ceiling now I got really lucky
because<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.240> piece<00:05:04.449> that<00:05:04.599> I<00:05:04.689> just<00:05:04.719> cut<00:05:05.259> off

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 
because the piece that I just cut off

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.529 
because the piece that I just cut off
fits<00:05:05.889> perfectly<00:05:06.490> right<00:05:06.849> here<00:05:07.060> where<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.240> need

another<00:05:11.020> piece<00:05:11.469> of<00:05:11.500> track<00:05:11.889> what<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:12.699> did<00:05:12.909> was

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
another piece of track what I did was
