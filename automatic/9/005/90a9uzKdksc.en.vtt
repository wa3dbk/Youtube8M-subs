00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.640
 good to all youtube friends 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.550
 welcome from no to my channel and here you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.709
 I bring a game not a great game of weapons 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.620
 but so with all the words played 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.530
 of weapons or you'll see what a barbarity 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.770
 which ballooned me it seems that was 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.000
 totally a fault and of course yes that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.850
 it's what I like, it's good 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.800
 starting rather now when I'm 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.540
 recording, there will be a few days 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 I recorded it quite a few days ago 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.620
 when you are seeing it I am in full 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 exam season these videos are 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.989
 which I already have programmed right now 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.510
 As you will understand, I am not playing in 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 no game so I'm a little bit like 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 Youtube parrot is worth a bit of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.219
 length reading messages that you send me 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.769
 private and others but a few things 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.649
 a weekend a live streaming 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.670
 mind that such a bad thing or something like that but 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.890
 during the week 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 you will have videos recorded with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.260
 priority without quality and I hope 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.420
 that you are liking all the content 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 what are you watching and are we going, are you going to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.040
 see here that I'm not going to the result 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 You are kemper the game so that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 see 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 armazo of arms that I take out in the black 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.010
 ops and well I wanted to talk a little bit 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.530
 of the black ops and is that I was playing 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.730
 and I do not know there's a very bad connection, I do not know what 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.470
 happens in this game I do not remember if 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.350
 had good or bad condition now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.940
 when you have the angle that I give it many 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.620
 times 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.030
 we'll see how the collision was going but of 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.520
 Normal for example I like 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.640
 terrestrial claws we do not see it here in the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.350
 connection is normal is good from normal not 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.119
 there is good connection those claws 13 are 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 find more land and I do not know 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.340
 why my friends do not know I do not know 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 I hope that when I finish tradables from 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.800
 a little bit to black ops is solved 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 this is a coincidence of the good life and 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.450
 know here what piece of tweets cop me 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.300
 I get tired with the sniper like 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.479
 you will remember this sniper was 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.330
 pretty bad done respect 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.880
 through when to pick up I do not know what 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.290
 I say as you know the fan did not have 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.540
 pretty bad compared to other 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.590
 other call of duty style games 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 neither do you need to be embalmed 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 talking 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 you know what doing 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.500
 it's pretty bad the sniper killed 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.290
 okay but it's normal sometimes towards the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 marquÃ©s other times not in this instead 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.629
 I see set the guard quad yes it was 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.870
 pretty bad 8 but good you see here 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.470
 how am I dominating or are we going 16 to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.860
 weapons already 20 that there are in total 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.140
 that is, he was dominating more power and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.459
 was who directly fails but still 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.410
 total failure and good yes here I want you 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.630
 it costs me a little bit to follow the sheet 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.829
 no no no it's not in this is in the end I think that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.470
 it costs me a little bit to get more 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.250
 deaths but nothing happens since I was 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.480
 a fault is going to make a clip p &amp; p to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.739
 m 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.959
