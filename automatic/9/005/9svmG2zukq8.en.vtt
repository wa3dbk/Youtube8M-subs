00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
blue touch the girl on top of the box so

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.219 
blue touch the girl on top of the box so
we<00:05:32.380> have<00:05:32.560> an<00:05:32.650> auditory<00:05:33.159> information<00:05:34.229> that

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
we have an auditory information that

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.860 
we have an auditory information that
decides<00:05:35.889> which<00:05:36.280> image<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.120> student<00:05:37.510> needs<00:05:37.659> to

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
decides which image the student needs to

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.950 
decides which image the student needs to
click<00:05:38.199> on<00:05:38.909> now<00:05:39.909> if<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.150> student<00:05:40.330> clicks<00:05:40.780> on

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
click on now if the student clicks on

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.080 
click on now if the student clicks on
the<00:05:41.110> wrong<00:05:41.470> area<00:05:43.650> in<00:05:44.650> this<00:05:45.520> case<00:05:45.760> we'll<00:05:45.940> get<00:05:46.060> a

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
the wrong area in this case we'll get a

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.939 
the wrong area in this case we'll get a
buzz<00:05:46.389> but<00:05:46.720> we<00:05:46.780> can<00:05:46.930> also<00:05:47.080> go<00:05:47.289> to<00:05:47.320> setting<00:05:47.919> and

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
buzz but we can also go to setting and

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.779 
buzz but we can also go to setting and
change<00:05:48.669> that<00:05:49.030> to<00:05:49.330> no<00:05:49.599> response<00:05:50.520> so<00:05:51.520> we<00:05:51.639> have

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
change that to no response so we have

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.850 
change that to no response so we have
many<00:05:52.060> options<00:05:52.240> on<00:05:52.599> what<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.080> app<00:05:53.199> needs<00:05:53.409> to<00:05:53.590> do

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
many options on what the app needs to do

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.610 
many options on what the app needs to do
if<00:05:54.070> this<00:05:54.280> didn't<00:05:54.550> gets<00:05:54.699> it<00:05:54.849> wrong<00:05:55.380> but<00:05:56.380> we<00:05:56.500> need

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
if this didn't gets it wrong but we need

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.680 
if this didn't gets it wrong but we need
to<00:05:56.710> touch<00:05:56.919> occur<00:05:57.280> on<00:05:57.460> top<00:05:58.120> so<00:05:58.360> in<00:05:58.419> this<00:05:58.479> case

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
to touch occur on top so in this case

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.760 
to touch occur on top so in this case
we're<00:05:58.870> checking<00:05:59.080> for<00:05:59.229> on<00:05:59.500> top

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
we're checking for on top

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.089 
we're checking for on top
the<00:06:02.639> box<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.419> if<00:06:03.630> a<00:06:03.840> student<00:06:04.319> gets<00:06:04.889> it

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
the box and if a student gets it

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.300 
the box and if a student gets it
correctly<00:06:05.639> soccer<00:06:06.240> prayer<00:06:06.630> if<00:06:07.259> the<00:06:07.979> student

correctly soccer prayer if the student

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.629 
correctly soccer prayer if the student
does<00:06:08.520> get<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:09.030> answer<00:06:09.389> correctly<00:06:10.639> the

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
does get the answer correctly the

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.719 
does get the answer correctly the
application<00:06:12.539> gives<00:06:12.840> a<00:06:13.229> positive

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
application gives a positive

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.370 
application gives a positive
reinforcement<00:06:14.729> that<00:06:14.910> repeats<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:16.020> correct

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
reinforcement that repeats the correct

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:24.950 
reinforcement that repeats the correct
answer<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:22.680> big<00:06:23.250> soccer<00:06:23.819> ball<00:06:24.180> is<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:24.750> one

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
answer the big soccer ball is the one

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.070 
answer the big soccer ball is the one

closest to the bone I have to click on

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.230 
closest to the bone I have to click on
done<00:06:30.870> we<00:06:31.860> can<00:06:32.039> see<00:06:32.220> here<00:06:32.520> that<00:06:32.550> they<00:06:32.940> did<00:06:33.120> of
