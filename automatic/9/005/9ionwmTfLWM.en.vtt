engineer and a little bit of medic as
well<00:02:01.450> but<00:02:01.659> i<00:02:01.720> decided<00:02:01.990> i<00:02:02.229> wanted<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.740> make<00:02:02.920> this

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
well but i decided i wanted to make this

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:20.420 
well but i decided i wanted to make this
video<00:02:03.399> into<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:03.970> heavy<00:02:04.390> assault<00:02:04.689> video

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.959 

I<00:02:21.469> gotta<00:02:22.469> say<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:22.859> glad<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.430> Rockets

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
I gotta say I'm glad that the Rockets

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.580 
I gotta say I'm glad that the Rockets
intransitive<00:02:24.510> doesn't<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.260> massive

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
intransitive doesn't have the massive

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.470 
intransitive doesn't have the massive
splash<00:02:25.950> damage<00:02:26.159> as<00:02:26.579> we<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.849> seen<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.150> some

splash damage as we have seen in some
other<00:02:27.629> games<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.829> is<00:02:28.980> probably<00:02:29.219> my<00:02:29.489> most

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
other games and this is probably my most

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.119 
other games and this is probably my most
successful<00:02:29.969> one<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.170> fight<00:02:31.439> but<00:02:32.099> a

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
successful one in this fight but a

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.399 
successful one in this fight but a
double<00:02:32.670> kid<00:02:32.849> here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.750> max<00:02:33.989> was<00:02:34.230> of

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
double kid here and the max was of

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.740 
double kid here and the max was of
course<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.859> was<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.219> for<00:02:35.599> doesn't<00:02:36.599> hurt
