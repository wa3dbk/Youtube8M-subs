00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
1994 Chevy Caprice station wagon it has

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.190 
1994 Chevy Caprice station wagon it has
a<00:00:06.180> brake<00:00:06.480> problem

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
a brake problem

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.049 
a brake problem
symptoms<00:00:07.950> include<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.460> brake<00:00:08.610> light<00:00:08.820> being

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
symptoms include the brake light being

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.120 
symptoms include the brake light being
on<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.809> front<00:00:10.170> fluid<00:00:10.469> reservoir<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
on the front fluid reservoir of the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.490 
on the front fluid reservoir of the
brake<00:00:11.340> system<00:00:11.370> being<00:00:11.910> depleted<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.599> no

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
brake system being depleted and no

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.770 
brake system being depleted and no
brakes<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.190> obviously<00:00:15.089> there's<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.389> leak<00:00:15.599> in

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
brakes so obviously there's a leak in

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.450 
brakes so obviously there's a leak in
the<00:00:15.900> system<00:00:16.080> now<00:00:16.500> front<00:00:16.800> reservoir<00:00:17.190> means

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the system now front reservoir means

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.859 
the system now front reservoir means
that<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> rear<00:00:17.940> brake<00:00:18.240> system<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.660> actually

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that the rear brake system is actually

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.240 
that the rear brake system is actually
leaking<00:00:19.170> something<00:00:19.740> cause<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> car<00:00:20.189> is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
leaking something cause the car is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
leaking something cause the car is
divided<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.670> two<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> recall<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.470> I'll

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
divided in two if you recall and I'll

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.380 
divided in two if you recall and I'll
link<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> video<00:00:23.070> right<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.820> did

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
link to the video right now I did

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
link to the video right now I did
replace<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> brake<00:00:25.050> line<00:00:25.260> from<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
replace the brake line from about the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.150 
replace the brake line from about the
firewall<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.630> back<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> rubber

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
firewall all the way back to the rubber

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
firewall all the way back to the rubber
hose<00:00:29.400> point<00:00:29.789> above<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.359> rear<00:00:30.570> axle<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.050> so

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
hose point above the rear axle there so

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
hose point above the rear axle there so
I<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> feeling<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> little

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I have a feeling that one of the little

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
I have a feeling that one of the little
side<00:00:33.270> lines<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.840> goes<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> either<00:00:34.260> side<00:00:34.530> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
side lines that goes to either side of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
side lines that goes to either side of
the<00:00:34.710> rear<00:00:34.860> wheels<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> those<00:00:35.969> lines<00:00:36.180> has

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the rear wheels one of those lines has

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360 
the rear wheels one of those lines has
rusted<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.840> failed<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
rusted out and failed here we are at the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
rusted out and failed here we are at the
reservoir<00:00:38.760> obviously<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> front<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.140> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
reservoir obviously the front one is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.660 
reservoir obviously the front one is
down<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> front<00:00:40.770> ones<00:00:41.010> connected<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.260 
them has failed it'll trip the brake
light<00:00:57.989> it'll<00:00:58.530> automatically<00:00:59.010> reset<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.940> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
light it'll automatically reset when you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.520 
light it'll automatically reset when you
can<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.690> apply<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> brakes<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
can actually apply the brakes and the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
can actually apply the brakes and the
switch<00:01:01.770> doesn't<00:01:02.070> activate<00:01:02.550> again<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
switch doesn't activate again it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
switch doesn't activate again it
actually<00:01:03.690> cleared<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> light<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> have

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
actually cleared the light but I have

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
actually cleared the light but I have
the<00:01:05.129> light<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> rear<00:01:06.240> brake<00:01:06.420> system

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the light this is the rear brake system

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
the light this is the rear brake system
and<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.799> obviously<00:01:08.159> drained<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.700> let's<00:01:08.880> go

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and it's obviously drained so let's go

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
and it's obviously drained so let's go
back<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:10.369> okay<00:01:11.369> Carlton<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> car<00:01:12.360> put

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.679 
the brake switch to the ABS module
that's<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.770> my<00:01:34.860> line<00:01:35.040> rusted<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.479> fix

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that's where my line rusted out the fix

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
that's where my line rusted out the fix
I've<00:01:36.869> decided<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.640> instead<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> actually

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I've decided to do instead of actually

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
I've decided to do instead of actually
finding<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.479> size<00:01:39.689> fitting<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
finding what size fitting that is and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
finding what size fitting that is and
finding<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.369> size<00:01:41.579> fitting<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
finding what size fitting it is on the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
finding what size fitting it is on the
ABS<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.140> probably<00:01:43.500> metric<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.130> an

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
ABS which is probably metric and an

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.039 
ABS which is probably metric and an
unknown<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.060> threads<00:01:45.360> per<00:01:45.540> inch<00:01:45.570> I'm

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
unknown you know threads per inch I'm

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.080 
unknown you know threads per inch I'm
going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.950> splice<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> line<00:01:47.700> where<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
going to just splice the line where it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.300 
going to just splice the line where it's
broken<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
broken so what I'm going to do is take a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.289 
broken so what I'm going to do is take a
cut<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.320> cut<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> unit<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:53.180> bend<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
cut from here cut the unit here bend it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.840 
cut from here cut the unit here bend it
around<00:01:54.710> or<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:56.100> maybe<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.430> cut<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
around or actually maybe just cut it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.219 
around or actually maybe just cut it
here<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.149> make<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.450> new<00:01:57.600> tube<00:01:57.840> bend<00:01:58.079> around

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
here and make my new tube bend around

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
here and make my new tube bend around
and<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:59.159> also<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> cut<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> good<00:02:00.149> section

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and I'm also going to cut a good section

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.600 
and I'm also going to cut a good section
of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> ABS<00:02:01.049> over<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.740> bring<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
of the ABS over here and bring it up and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
of the ABS over here and bring it up and
put<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:03.000> fitting<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.659> between<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.140> two

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
put my fitting just in between the two

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.530 
put my fitting just in between the two
and<00:02:04.619> I'll<00:02:05.100> use<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.670> long<00:02:06.030> section<00:02:06.390> right

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and I'll use that a long section right

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
and I'll use that a long section right
here<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> obviously<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:08.009> too<00:02:08.069> long<00:02:08.369> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
here which is obviously way too long but

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
here which is obviously way too long but
I<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.179> cut<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> size<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.989> shape<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
I will cut it to size and shape it to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.900 
I will cut it to size and shape it to
size<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:11.790> unions

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
size I have two unions

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.820 
size I have two unions
and<00:02:13.060> what<00:02:13.570> I'll<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.260> car<00:02:14.470> I'll<00:02:14.680> go

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
and what I'll do is on the car I'll go

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.320 
and what I'll do is on the car I'll go
ahead<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.220> put<00:02:15.340> two<00:02:15.460> more<00:02:15.580> flare<00:02:15.850> fittings<00:02:16.210> on

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
ahead and put two more flare fittings on

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.060 
ahead and put two more flare fittings on
that<00:02:16.480> brake<00:02:16.660> line<00:02:16.870> somewhere<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.890> and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
that brake line somewhere here and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.830 
that brake line somewhere here and
somewhere<00:02:18.340> towards<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> ABS<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.720> way

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
somewhere towards the ABS and that way

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.790 
somewhere towards the ABS and that way
I'll<00:02:19.960> just<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.230> able<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.440> cinch<00:02:20.680> everything

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
I'll just be able to cinch everything

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.770 
I'll just be able to cinch everything
together<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.460> our<00:02:21.940> repair<00:02:22.210> will<00:02:22.330> be<00:02:22.420> complete

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
together and our repair will be complete

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.480 
together and our repair will be complete
and<00:02:22.810> at<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> later<00:02:23.680> date<00:02:23.890> I'll<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.160> rip<00:02:24.370> out

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
and at a later date I'll just rip out

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.070 
and at a later date I'll just rip out
the<00:02:24.640> old<00:02:24.670> line<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.750> doesn't<00:02:25.990> confuse

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the old line so it doesn't confuse

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.100 
the old line so it doesn't confuse
anyone<00:02:26.470> as<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.830> why<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.130> leaking<00:02:28.110> first

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
anyone as to why it's leaking first

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.930 
anyone as to why it's leaking first
thing<00:02:29.230> I'm<00:02:29.320> going<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.100> cut<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.700> line

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
thing I'm going to do is cut this line

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.490 
thing I'm going to do is cut this line
about<00:02:31.270> here<00:02:31.750> then<00:02:32.020> I'm<00:02:32.110> actually<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.440> to

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
about here then I'm actually going to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.620 
about here then I'm actually going to
take<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.800> off<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.100> brake<00:02:33.310> switch<00:02:33.490> here<00:02:33.940> just

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
take it off the brake switch here just

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
take it off the brake switch here just
because<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.930> easier<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.410> put<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> flare<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
because it's easier to put a flare on it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.810 
because it's easier to put a flare on it
in<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:37.530> fitting<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.770> but<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.520> know<00:02:39.580> off<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
in a fitting on it but you know off the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:50.790 
in a fitting on it but you know off the
car<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:45.240> there<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.330> goes<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.500> line<00:02:50.680> was

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
car there there it goes the line was

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.410 
car there there it goes the line was
separated<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.490> ended<00:02:51.760> up<00:02:51.790> putting<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> fitting

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
separated I ended up putting a fitting

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.870 
separated I ended up putting a fitting
here<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.840> pinched<00:02:53.320> cut<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.770> so<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:54.250> doesn't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
here I pinched cut that so that doesn't

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.700 
here I pinched cut that so that doesn't
go<00:02:54.940> anywhere<00:02:55.300> right<00:02:55.330> now<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.020> it's<00:02:56.530> loose

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
go anywhere right now and it's loose

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.350 
go anywhere right now and it's loose
right<00:02:56.920> now<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.520> maneuver<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:57.910> around

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
right now so I can maneuver it around

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.710 
right now so I can maneuver it around
I<00:02:58.390> took<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.200> long<00:02:59.410> piece<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.400> built<00:03:00.690> put<00:03:01.690> a

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I took my long piece and I built put a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.660 
I took my long piece and I built put a
180<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.860> can<00:03:02.980> do<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.160> using<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.460> piece<00:03:03.640> of

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
180 in it you can do it using a piece of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.010 
180 in it you can do it using a piece of
wood<00:03:03.910> although<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.240> would<00:03:04.420> suggest<00:03:04.540> using<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
wood although I would suggest using a

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.270 
wood although I would suggest using a
tubing<00:03:05.320> bending<00:03:05.590> tool<00:03:05.740> just<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.130> it's

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
tubing bending tool just so it's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.280 
tubing bending tool just so it's
prettier<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:07.600> key<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.110> remember

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
prettier the key is just to remember

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.870 
prettier the key is just to remember
don't<00:03:08.440> make<00:03:08.560> any<00:03:08.740> super<00:03:09.130> pinch<00:03:09.340> points<00:03:09.730> just

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
don't make any super pinch points just

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.640 
don't make any super pinch points just
so<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.330> know<00:03:10.360> fluid<00:03:10.750> does<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.200> move

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
so that you know fluid does have to move

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.880 
so that you know fluid does have to move
back<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:11.890> forth<00:03:12.100> in<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:12.790> put<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.800> 180<00:03:14.800> in

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
back and forth in this I put it a 180 in

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.440 
back and forth in this I put it a 180 in
it<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:15.250> when<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.490> attach<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.850> approximately

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
it so when I attach it approximately

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.990 
it so when I attach it approximately
this<00:03:16.570> way<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.740> good<00:03:17.920> run<00:03:18.100> up<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.910> I'll

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
this way we get a good run up and I'll

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.280 
this way we get a good run up and I'll
probably<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.510> up<00:03:19.660> some<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.050> get<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> good

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
probably have it up some we get a good

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.440 
probably have it up some we get a good
run<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.800> ABS<00:03:21.550> module<00:03:21.940> out<00:03:22.120> of<00:03:22.210> here<00:03:22.360> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
run up to the ABS module out of here and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.430 
run up to the ABS module out of here and
I'm<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.690> move<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> camera<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.320> we<00:03:23.350> can

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
I'm going to move the camera so we can

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440 
I'm going to move the camera so we can
better<00:03:23.680> see<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.610> about<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.000> best<00:03:25.240> shot

this<00:04:02.280> quarter<00:04:02.550> inch<00:04:02.670> line<00:04:02.850> it's<00:04:02.940> pretty<00:04:03.180> thick

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
this quarter inch line it's pretty thick

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.980 
this quarter inch line it's pretty thick
FYI<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:05.190> can<00:04:05.340> take<00:04:05.460> kind<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.820> beating<00:04:06.120> I'm

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.850 

now<00:04:21.359> that's<00:04:21.540> loose<00:04:21.750> enough<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:26.090> maneuver<00:04:27.090> up<00:04:27.419> I

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860

the<00:05:05.280> Impala<00:05:05.520> SS<00:05:05.700> forums<00:05:06.120> do<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.360> too<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:06.720> I'm

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
the Impala SS forums do it too so I'm

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.550 
the Impala SS forums do it too so I'm
not<00:05:06.900> too<00:05:07.080> worried<00:05:07.260> about<00:05:07.290> it

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
not too worried about it

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.130 
not too worried about it

there<00:05:39.750> that's<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.110> farthest<00:05:40.410> point<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.710> the

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
there that's the farthest point in the

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.409 
there that's the farthest point in the
system<00:05:41.070> hopefully<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.880> don't<00:05:41.970> have<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.270> bleed

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
system hopefully I don't have to bleed

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
to believe the rear brakes but if I do I
