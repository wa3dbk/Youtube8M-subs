00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
sound like right now so right now let's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.830 
sound like right now so right now let's
get<00:00:53.310> into<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.300> we're<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> g

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
get into that right now we're on the g

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.390 
get into that right now we're on the g
string<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.470> fifth<00:00:55.680> fret<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.160> we're

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
string at the fifth fret and we're

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.740 
string at the fifth fret and we're
pretty<00:00:56.490> much<00:00:56.670> gonna<00:00:56.820> break<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.150> that<00:00:57.540> bin

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
pretty much gonna break down that bin

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.480 
pretty much gonna break down that bin
for<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.230> gonna<00:00:58.350> play<00:00:58.560> it<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.829> slow<00:00:59.190> so

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
for you I'm gonna play it really slow so

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
for you I'm gonna play it really slow so
you<00:00:59.880> can<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.150> hear<00:01:00.360> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you can actually hear the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
you can actually hear the
characteristics<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.800> bend<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
characteristics of the bend when you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.860 
characteristics of the bend when you
hear<00:01:03.060> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.210> bit<00:01:03.390> faster<00:01:03.720> in<00:01:03.810> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
hear a little bit faster in the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.660 
hear a little bit faster in the
progression<00:01:04.110> sometimes<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.339> hard<00:01:05.550> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
progression sometimes it's it's hard to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
progression sometimes it's it's hard to
understand<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.690> how<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.990> getting

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
understand you know how it's getting

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.749 
understand you know how it's getting
that<00:01:07.410> tone<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:07.920> before<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> another

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
that tone right before you go to another

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.910 
that tone right before you go to another
note<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.210> let's<00:01:09.240> try<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.720> right<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:09.920> we're

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
note so let's try that right now we're

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
note so let's try that right now we're
on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> fifth<00:01:11.280> fret<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> g<00:01:11.940> string<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
on the fifth fret on the g string and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
on the fifth fret on the g string and
we're<00:01:12.869> pretty<00:01:12.960> much<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.320> bend<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.190> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
we're pretty much gonna bend it at the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.590 
we're pretty much gonna bend it at the
same<00:01:14.430> time<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.790> we're<00:01:14.940> plucking<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.420> we're

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
same time as we're plucking it we're

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510 
same time as we're plucking it we're
gonna<00:01:15.690> pluck<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.190> harsh<00:01:17.430> but

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
gonna pluck it a little bit harsh but

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
gonna pluck it a little bit harsh but
just<00:01:17.850> listen<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.300> bend<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:18.690> as<00:01:18.840> I'm

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
just listen to the bend right now as I'm

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
just listen to the bend right now as I'm
actually<00:01:19.080> pulling<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> string<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
actually pulling on the string and this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
actually pulling on the string and this
is<00:01:20.759> definitely<00:01:20.910> a<00:01:21.149> bin<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:21.899> gonna<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
is definitely a bin you're gonna want to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.440 
is definitely a bin you're gonna want to
pull<00:01:22.560> down<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.819> you<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.149> want<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> go

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pull down like this you don't want to go

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.059 
pull down like this you don't want to go
up<00:01:24.690> so<00:01:24.929> we're<00:01:25.050> gonna<00:01:25.140> pull<00:01:25.350> down<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.770> let's<00:01:25.920> try

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069 
up so we're gonna pull down so let's try

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.260 
up so we're gonna pull down so let's try
that<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.310> now

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.060 

and<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> progression<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.799> actually

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and in the progression you can actually

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.789 
and in the progression you can actually
end<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.280> holding<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.570> bend<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.590> back

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
end up holding it on the bend to go back

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.580 
end up holding it on the bend to go back
down<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.180> seventh<00:01:36.540> fret<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.049> our<00:01:37.320> third

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
down to the seventh fret on our third

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
down to the seventh fret on our third
string<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:38.850> watch<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
string so if you actually watch that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.440 
string so if you actually watch that
right<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.630> we'll<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.119> remember

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
right now we'll do that and remember

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.570 
right now we'll do that and remember
that<00:01:45.930> seventh<00:01:46.530> fret<00:01:46.830> right<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> D

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
that seventh fret right here on the D

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.370 
that seventh fret right here on the D
string<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.570> our<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> net<00:01:49.080> which<00:01:49.259> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
string is going to be our a net which is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
string is going to be our a net which is
where<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> resolve<00:01:50.039> is<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.940> actual<00:01:51.270> hook

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
where the resolve is on the actual hook

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.639 
where the resolve is on the actual hook
so<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:51.750> why<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.960> sounds<00:01:52.200> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.470> catchy

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
so that's why it sounds kind of catchy

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.460 
so that's why it sounds kind of catchy
and<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.130> hooky<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.930> let's<00:01:55.080> try<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> right

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and and hooky so let's try that right

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.590 
and and hooky so let's try that right
now<00:01:55.649> we're<00:01:56.250> into<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> same<00:01:56.640> bins<00:01:56.909> again<00:01:59.600> now

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
now we're into the same bins again now

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969 
now we're into the same bins again now
what<00:02:00.780> I'm<00:02:00.899> doing<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.289> my<00:02:01.319> right<00:02:01.590> hand<00:02:01.619> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
what I'm doing with my right hand is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
what I'm doing with my right hand is
actually<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.429> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> pausing<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
actually just kind of pausing that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
actually just kind of pausing that
string<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.050> mid<00:02:04.649> bin<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.490> watch<00:02:05.640> right

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
string in mid bin so if you watch right

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370 
string in mid bin so if you watch right
now<00:02:05.970> we're<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.210> gonna<00:02:06.330> worry<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
now we're just gonna worry about that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.779 
now we're just gonna worry about that
one<00:02:07.530> bin<00:02:07.770> let's<00:02:08.009> keep<00:02:08.160> practicing<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.700> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
one bin let's keep practicing it this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.630 
one bin let's keep practicing it this
way<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.040> actually<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.400> hear<00:02:14.519> my

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
way so you can actually kind of hear my

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.729 
way so you can actually kind of hear my
finger<00:02:14.940> pressing<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.810> string<00:02:16.170> with<00:02:16.590> my

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
finger pressing on the string with my

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.170 
finger pressing on the string with my
rhythm<00:02:17.040> hand<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.200> we'll<00:02:19.319> try<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.470> again

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 

and<00:02:24.480> remember<00:02:24.930> whenever<00:02:25.110> you're<00:02:25.380> jamming<00:02:26.160> in

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
and remember whenever you're jamming in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.160 
and remember whenever you're jamming in
a<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.819> minor<00:02:27.000> pentatonic<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:27.840> very<00:02:27.989> easy

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
a in a minor pentatonic it's very easy

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
a in a minor pentatonic it's very easy
to<00:02:28.380> throw<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.430> Bend<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.880> there<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.269> if

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
to throw this this Bend in there so if

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
to throw this this Bend in there so if
you're<00:02:30.510> jamming<00:02:31.080> with<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> band<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.680> want<00:02:31.860> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
you're jamming with the band you want to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.259 
you're jamming with the band you want to
kind<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.160> add<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.400> spice<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.030> you're<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
kind of add a little spice if you're the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.600 
kind of add a little spice if you're the
lean<00:02:33.480> guy<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.380> can<00:02:34.500> pretty<00:02:34.650> much<00:02:34.739> use<00:02:35.430> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
lean guy you can pretty much use this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.069 
lean guy you can pretty much use this
effect<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.329> right<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.690> now<00:02:36.810> we've<00:02:36.930> actually

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
effect all right so now we've actually

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.710 
effect all right so now we've actually
set<00:02:37.440> our<00:02:37.560> looping<00:02:37.950> unit<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> simple<00:02:39.269> two

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
set our looping unit to a simple two

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.050 
set our looping unit to a simple two
core<00:02:39.959> progression<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> key<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.820> minor

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
core progression in the key of a minor

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.880 
core progression in the key of a minor
and<00:02:42.360> our<00:02:42.840> simple<00:02:43.230> chords<00:02:43.500> are<00:02:43.680> going<00:02:43.829> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and our simple chords are going to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
and our simple chords are going to
bounce<00:02:44.010> back<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.430> forth<00:02:44.519> between<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.299> minor

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
bounce back and forth between a minor

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.440 
bounce back and forth between a minor
and<00:02:46.109> F<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.859> watch<00:02:47.070> how<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.370> actual<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:48.090> minor

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and F so watch how the actual a minor

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
and F so watch how the actual a minor
pentatonic<00:02:48.870> scale<00:02:49.380> kind<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.709> bounces<00:02:50.100> off<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
pentatonic scale kind of bounces off the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.890 
pentatonic scale kind of bounces off the
two<00:02:50.519> chords<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.269> I'm<00:02:51.480> gonna<00:02:51.570> play<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> little

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
two chords and I'm gonna play a little

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.110 
two chords and I'm gonna play a little
bit<00:02:52.230> extra<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.579> scale<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.030> can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
bit extra in the scale so you can

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.310 
bit extra in the scale so you can
actually<00:02:54.420> hear<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.600> while<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:54.900> playing<00:02:55.140> so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
actually hear it while it's playing so

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720 
actually hear it while it's playing so
here<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:55.950> right<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.220> here's<00:02:56.489> what<00:02:56.549> our

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
here we go all right so here's what our

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.770 
here we go all right so here's what our
rhythm<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.209> sound<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.630> I've

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
rhythm is going to sound like that I've

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.420 
rhythm is going to sound like that I've
previously<00:02:58.049> recorded<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.980> we're<00:02:59.190> let<00:02:59.310> that

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
previously recorded and we're let that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.949 
previously recorded and we're let that
played<00:02:59.700> through<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.329> I'm<00:03:00.540> pretty<00:03:00.660> much<00:03:00.780> gonna

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
played through and I'm pretty much gonna

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.319 
played through and I'm pretty much gonna
hop<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.980> play<00:03:02.190> over<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.609> in<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> minor

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
hop in and play over that in the a minor

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.599 
hop in and play over that in the a minor
pentatonic<00:03:03.450> scale<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.920> let's<00:03:05.070> hear<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.370> one

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
pentatonic scale so let's hear that one

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.160 
pentatonic scale so let's hear that one
time<00:03:05.880> through<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.450> I'm<00:03:06.510> gonna<00:03:06.600> jump<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.019> on

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
time through and I'm gonna jump in on

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.509 
time through and I'm gonna jump in on
the<00:03:07.290> second<00:03:07.650> part<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.130> actually<00:03:08.220> hear

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
the second part so you can actually hear

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:43.550 
the second part so you can actually hear
it<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.730> sequence<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.359> go

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.750 

so<00:03:44.560> right<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.920> actually<00:03:45.310> heard<00:03:45.519> how<00:03:45.730> I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
so right now you actually heard how I

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.490 
so right now you actually heard how I
played<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.239> in<00:03:46.360> sequence<00:03:46.780> with<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.319> two

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
played it in sequence with the two

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.229 
played it in sequence with the two
chords<00:03:47.920> two<00:03:48.129> chords<00:03:48.489> are<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:48.610> really<00:03:48.939> good<00:03:49.060> way

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
chords two chords are a really good way

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.880 
chords two chords are a really good way
to<00:03:49.269> actually<00:03:49.629> practice<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.230> scale<00:03:50.560> because

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
to actually practice a scale because

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.649 
to actually practice a scale because
you've<00:03:51.040> got<00:03:51.220> just<00:03:51.700> bouncing<00:03:52.090> back<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.480> forth

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
you've got just bouncing back and forth

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.420 
you've got just bouncing back and forth
back<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:52.930> forth<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.439> he<00:03:53.590> gives<00:03:54.099> you<00:03:54.189> a<00:03:54.220> chance

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
back and forth and he gives you a chance

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.740 
back and forth and he gives you a chance
to<00:03:54.489> really<00:03:54.609> learn<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.000> scale<00:03:55.209> too<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.629> can

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
to really learn the scale too you can

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.300 
to really learn the scale too you can
just<00:03:55.930> keep<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.650> know<00:03:56.680> listening<00:03:57.069> for<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
especially in the Blues world and when

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.000 
especially in the Blues world and when
you<00:04:04.150> go<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.359> jam<00:04:04.629> with<00:04:04.780> somebody<00:04:05.079> too<00:04:05.319> so

you go to jam with somebody too so

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.410 
you go to jam with somebody too so
you'll<00:04:06.159> notice<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.579> was<00:04:06.700> playing<00:04:06.939> a<00:04:07.030> little<00:04:07.239> bit

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
you'll notice I was playing a little bit

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.140 
you'll notice I was playing a little bit
of<00:04:07.480> variations<00:04:08.170> in<00:04:08.290> my<00:04:08.470> pentatonic<00:04:09.159> scale<00:04:09.430> for

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
of variations in my pentatonic scale for

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.490 
of variations in my pentatonic scale for
a<00:04:10.180> little<00:04:10.329> bit<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.510> flavor<00:04:10.690> but<00:04:11.049> what<00:04:11.230> I<00:04:11.260> always

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
a little bit of flavor but what I always

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.129 
a little bit of flavor but what I always
did<00:04:11.889> was<00:04:12.549> actually<00:04:12.940> came<00:04:13.239> back<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.959> root

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
did was actually came back to the root

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.080 
did was actually came back to the root
so<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:14.709> keep<00:04:14.920> walking<00:04:15.310> back<00:04:15.430> down<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.909> actually

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
so I keep walking back down and actually

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.599 
so I keep walking back down and actually
at<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.419> end<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.870> our<00:04:17.130> lesson<00:04:18.130> or<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.459> little

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
at the end of our lesson or the little

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.460 
at the end of our lesson or the little
example<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.299> played<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.720> actually<00:04:20.079> keep

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
example I just played I actually keep

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.290 
example I just played I actually keep
playing<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.310> kind<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.579> resolves

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
playing that so it kind of resolves

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.700 
playing that so it kind of resolves
itself<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.750> pretty<00:04:22.900> much<00:04:22.990> comes<00:04:23.289> back<00:04:23.530> around

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
itself it pretty much comes back around

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.610 
itself it pretty much comes back around
and<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.520> was<00:04:24.639> going<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.820> make<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:24.970> catchy<00:04:25.270> hook

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
and this was going to make a catchy hook

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.240 
and this was going to make a catchy hook
especially<00:04:26.620> when<00:04:26.740> you're<00:04:26.830> jamming<00:04:27.160> with
