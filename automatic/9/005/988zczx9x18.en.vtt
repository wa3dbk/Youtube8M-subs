slipper modification what it is is I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.009 
slipper modification what it is is I
have<00:00:21.720> adapted<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.740> slipper<00:00:23.220> clutch<00:00:23.539> to<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> XL

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
amount of gearing options available to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.350 
amount of gearing options available to
it<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.530> that's<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> open<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> door<00:00:38.399> wide

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.639 

actually<00:01:24.329> works<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:24.930> well<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.469> another

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
actually works really well and another

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.880 
actually works really well and another
thing<00:01:26.579> that<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.619> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> do

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
thing that this is going to going to do

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.969 
thing that this is going to going to do
is<00:01:29.219> you'd<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.090> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:31.049> able<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> control

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
is you'd be able to be able to control

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
is you'd be able to be able to control
wheel<00:01:32.310> spin<00:01:33.649> by<00:01:34.649> adjusting<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.759> slipper<00:01:36.060> if

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
wheel spin by adjusting the slipper if

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
wheel spin by adjusting the slipper if
you<00:01:36.659> give<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:36.990> little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.469> of<00:01:37.560> slip<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you give it a little bit of slip that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.410 
you give it a little bit of slip that
that<00:01:38.789> should<00:01:38.970> help<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.299> wheel<00:01:39.509> spin<00:01:40.039> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
that should help with wheel spin and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.169 
that should help with wheel spin and
maybe<00:01:42.799> allow<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.039> maintain<00:01:44.700> control<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
maybe allow you to maintain control of

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.419 
maybe allow you to maintain control of
the<00:01:45.329> vehicle<00:01:45.479> better<00:01:46.039> but<00:01:47.039> anyway<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> just
