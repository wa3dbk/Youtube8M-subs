you're going to determine where is your

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
you're going to determine where is your
walkway<00:01:23.600> we're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.140> two

walkway we're going to use these two

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
walkway we're going to use these two
blocks<00:01:26.009> right<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> either<00:01:27.420> side

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
blocks right here and so on either side

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.520 
blocks right here and so on either side
we're<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> place<00:01:28.860> two<00:01:30.290> pillars<00:01:31.290> of

we're going to place two pillars of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
we're going to place two pillars of
sticky<00:01:31.860> pistons<00:01:32.250> facing<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> direction

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
either put down a lever and then flip it

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.629 
either put down a lever and then flip it
and<00:02:47.209> that'll<00:02:47.569> keep<00:02:47.719> it<00:02:47.930> closed<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.609> I

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
and that'll keep it closed or what I

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.030 
and that'll keep it closed or what I
want<00:02:49.909> wanted<00:02:50.449> to<00:02:50.599> do<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:51.079> because<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:51.889> this

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
want wanted to do is because if this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.369 
want wanted to do is because if this
lever<00:02:52.280> got<00:02:52.489> destroyed

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
lever got destroyed

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.559 
lever got destroyed
it<00:02:54.590> would<00:02:54.919> not<00:02:55.430> be<00:02:56.769> wouldn't<00:02:57.769> be<00:02:58.120> very<00:02:59.120> good<00:02:59.239> it

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
it would not be wouldn't be very good it

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.449 
it would not be wouldn't be very good it
would<00:02:59.719> leave<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.019> door<00:03:00.199> open<00:03:00.409> so<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.829> inverted

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
would leave the door open so I inverted

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.220 
would leave the door open so I inverted
the<00:03:01.609> whole<00:03:01.879> signal<00:03:02.299> by<00:03:02.719> breaking<00:03:03.109> this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
the whole signal by breaking this

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.890 
the whole signal by breaking this
redstone<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.919> putting<00:03:04.250> down<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.669> torch<00:03:05.060> so

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
redstone and putting down a torch so

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.949 
redstone and putting down a torch so
that<00:03:06.109> naturally<00:03:06.859> it's<00:03:07.099> closed<00:03:07.689> but<00:03:08.689> if<00:03:08.840> I

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
that naturally it's closed but if I

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.250 
that naturally it's closed but if I
power<00:03:09.169> this<00:03:09.469> one<00:03:09.739> block<00:03:10.010> whoop<00:03:10.969> it<00:03:11.930> will

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
power this one block whoop it will

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.209 
power this one block whoop it will
unpowered<00:03:13.099> a<00:03:13.639> torch<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.449> open<00:03:15.109> up<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.919> door

unpowered a torch and open up the door

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.520 
unpowered a torch and open up the door
if<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:17.150> accidentally<00:03:17.840> put<00:03:18.049> this<00:03:18.229> somewhere
