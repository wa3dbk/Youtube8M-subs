00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and essentially it's just roasted

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
and essentially it's just roasted
seaweed<00:01:31.939> with<00:01:32.939> maybe<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.780> slight<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.530> didn't

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
seaweed with maybe a slight I didn't

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160
