00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.390 
that's the bottom of it keeping them
mind<00:05:28.930> that's<00:05:29.170> aluminum<00:05:29.770> see<00:05:29.980> gonna<00:05:30.160> take<00:05:30.370> a

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
mind that's aluminum see gonna take a

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.930 
mind that's aluminum see gonna take a
lot<00:05:30.640> off<00:05:30.850> with<00:05:31.060> steel<00:05:31.920> look<00:05:32.920> at<00:05:33.040> that<00:05:33.160> it's
