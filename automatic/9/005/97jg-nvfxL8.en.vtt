00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.360 
more likely to believe that some guy in
Kentucky<00:04:51.750> would<00:04:52.229> find<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.680> out<00:04:52.830> in<00:04:53.040> his<00:04:53.160> cow

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
Kentucky would find it out in his cow

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.150 
Kentucky would find it out in his cow
pasture<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.150> put<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.419> on<00:04:54.510> eBay<00:04:55.050> that's<00:04:55.860> more

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
pasture and put it on eBay that's more

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.460 
pasture and put it on eBay that's more
believable<00:04:56.630> that's<00:04:57.630> what<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:57.900> would<00:04:58.050> expect<00:04:58.080> to

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
believable that's what I would expect to

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.460 
believable that's what I would expect to
happen<00:04:58.820> or<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.060> guy<00:05:00.210> would<00:05:00.510> contact<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.169> news

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
happen or the guy would contact the news

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.610 
happen or the guy would contact the news
and<00:05:01.889> rake<00:05:02.760> in<00:05:03.000> some<00:05:03.300> big<00:05:03.660> bucks<00:05:03.930> having<00:05:04.500> the

alien on his property so that's more

alien on his property so that's more
likely<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.889> me<00:05:11.130> than<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:12.000> idea<00:05:12.419> that<00:05:12.510> a

spent last night looking at about

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.020 
spent last night looking at about
probably<00:05:34.200> 30<00:05:34.500> or<00:05:34.620> 40<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:35.130> them<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.520> mean<00:05:35.669> I'm<00:05:35.789> you

myself is this conclusive and I never
come<00:05:46.919> to<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.160> answer<00:05:47.490> oh<00:05:47.849> this<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.300> conclusive

come to the answer oh this is conclusive

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.920 
come to the answer oh this is conclusive
evidence<00:05:49.580> there's<00:05:50.580> things<00:05:50.970> in<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.270> sky<00:05:51.360> half

you know it's just a light mu it could

you know it's just a light mu it could
be<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.340> helicopter<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:57.510> could<00:05:57.630> be<00:05:57.720> anything<00:05:59.000> it

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
be a helicopter it could be anything it

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.520 
be a helicopter it could be anything it
can<00:06:00.210> look<00:06:00.389> like<00:06:00.450> it's<00:06:00.810> traveling<00:06:01.260> a<00:06:01.320> great

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
can look like it's traveling a great

can look like it's traveling a great
distance<00:06:01.800> because<00:06:02.220> there's<00:06:02.430> two<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:02.610> them<00:06:02.789> one

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
could be a military exercise exercise

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.890 
could be a military exercise exercise
why<00:06:09.990> is<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.410> alien<00:06:11.039> life<00:06:11.280> from<00:06:11.780> some<00:06:12.780> other

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
why is it alien life from some other

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.320 
why is it alien life from some other
wormhole<00:06:13.560> across<00:06:14.070> space<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:14.849> is<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.150> more

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
wormhole across space this is the more

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.870 
wormhole across space this is the more
likely<00:06:15.479> explanation
