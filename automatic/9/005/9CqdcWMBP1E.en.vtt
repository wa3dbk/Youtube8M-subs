it's<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.640> through

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.099 

using<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.319> time<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:02.319> kill<00:03:05.230> okay<00:03:06.230> next<00:03:06.680> is

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
using this time of the kill okay next is

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.179 
using this time of the kill okay next is
handling<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:09.799> you're<00:03:10.129> a<00:03:10.629> normal<00:03:11.680> lung<00:03:12.680> skirt

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
handling and you're a normal lung skirt

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
handling and you're a normal lung skirt
and<00:03:13.569> then<00:03:14.569> we<00:03:15.019> leave<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.980> then<00:03:16.760> do<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.450> again

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
and then we leave and then do it again

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.050 
and then we leave and then do it again
so<00:03:20.209> through<00:03:20.480> look<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:21.049> it's<00:03:21.439> a<00:03:21.819> little<00:03:22.819> later

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
so through look like it's a little later

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.349 
so through look like it's a little later
dress<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:25.459> then<00:03:25.730> you're<00:03:25.909> going<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.150> design

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359
