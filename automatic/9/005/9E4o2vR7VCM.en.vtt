thingy there see she lunges and she

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.940 
thingy there see she lunges and she
misses<00:02:13.520> me<00:02:13.790> because<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.240> wall<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.710> she's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
misses me because of that wall so she's

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.520 
misses me because of that wall so she's
now<00:02:16.160> like<00:02:16.430> just<00:02:16.460> standing<00:02:17.150> there<00:02:17.180> I'm<00:02:18.140> kind<00:02:18.470> of

now like just standing there I'm kind of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.990 
now like just standing there I'm kind of
backing<00:02:18.770> off<00:02:19.040> trying<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.430> get<00:02:19.550> out<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.880> her

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
backing off trying to get out of her

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.630 
backing off trying to get out of her
lunch<00:02:20.210> range<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.620> keep<00:02:21.800> shooting<00:02:22.310> an<00:02:22.490> ad

lunch range and I keep shooting an ad

poof gone where did sweet little roro go

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.270 
poof gone where did sweet little roro go
that's<00:02:26.900> what<00:02:27.050> her<00:02:27.140> mom<00:02:27.380> said<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.860> day<00:02:27.980> she<00:02:28.160> was

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
that's what her mom said the day she was

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.460 
that's what her mom said the day she was
born<00:02:28.340> oh<00:02:28.910> where<00:02:29.420> did<00:02:29.480> she<00:02:29.660> go<00:02:29.750> all<00:02:29.990> there<00:02:30.200> she

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
born oh where did she go all there she

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.930 
born oh where did she go all there she
is<00:02:30.500> she's<00:02:31.370> down<00:02:31.610> here<00:02:33.340> really<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.580> can

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
is she's down here really I can

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.200 
is she's down here really I can
understand<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> game<00:02:35.840> where<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:37.210> this

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
understand the game where it's like this

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.630 
understand the game where it's like this
person<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:38.810> walking<00:02:38.960> over<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:40.100> they

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
person is walking over here and they

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.330 
person is walking over here and they
slightly<00:02:40.970> change<00:02:41.420> their<00:02:41.660> direction

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
slightly change their direction

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.470 
slightly change their direction
but<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> other<00:02:43.489> box<00:02:43.849> didn't<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.299> that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
but the other box didn't get that

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.000 
but the other box didn't get that
information<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.319> they're<00:02:45.530> just<00:02:45.709> going<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.890> go

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
information so they're just going to go

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.670 
information so they're just going to go
that<00:02:46.220> way<00:02:46.250> still<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.909> can<00:02:47.870> kind<00:02:48.079> of<00:02:48.170> understand

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that way still I can kind of understand

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.520 
that way still I can kind of understand
that<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.670> how<00:02:49.879> can<00:02:49.939> the<00:02:50.269> game<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.110> wrong

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
that but how can the game be so wrong

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.550 
that but how can the game be so wrong
about<00:02:52.010> where<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.640> person<00:02:52.939> is<00:02:53.420> once<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.349> take<00:02:54.530> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
about where this person is once I take a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.229 
about where this person is once I take a
look<00:02:54.769> at<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.010> film<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.519> can<00:02:55.849> tell<00:02:56.090> what

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
look at the film I can tell what

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.899 
look at the film I can tell what
actually<00:02:56.720> happened<00:02:57.140> on<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.470> lunge<00:02:57.769> here<00:02:58.189> she

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
actually happened on this lunge here she

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.059 
actually happened on this lunge here she
probably<00:02:59.150> should<00:02:59.810> probably<00:03:00.230> flew<00:03:00.530> up<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.769> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
probably should probably flew up to the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.880 
probably should probably flew up to the
right<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.790> kept<00:03:02.599> flying<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.290> then<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.590> fell

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
right and kept flying and then just fell

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.280 
right and kept flying and then just fell
that's<00:03:04.489> obvious<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.269> me<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.079> actually

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that's obvious to me of what actually

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.380 
that's obvious to me of what actually
happened<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:07.340> not<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.579> point<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
happened that's not the point here the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.470 
happened that's not the point here the
point<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.650> game<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:10.670> wrong<00:03:11.090> about

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
point is that the game is so wrong about

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.569 
point is that the game is so wrong about
where<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:11.989> person<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.099> main<00:03:13.310> thing

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
where this person is it's the main thing

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.490 
where this person is it's the main thing
that's<00:03:13.790> wrong<00:03:13.970> with<00:03:14.030> halo<00:03:14.599> is<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.319> big

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
that's wrong with halo is the big

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.940 
that's wrong with halo is the big
difference<00:03:16.040> between<00:03:16.220> what<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.150> see<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.870> what

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
difference between what I see and what

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.330 
difference between what I see and what
happens<00:03:18.950> there<00:03:19.459> needs<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.909> be<00:03:19.940> some<00:03:20.510> sort<00:03:20.900> of

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
happens there needs to be some sort of

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.339 
happens there needs to be some sort of
continuity<00:03:22.340> between<00:03:23.120> what's<00:03:23.569> going<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.019> and

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
continuity between what's going on and

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.670 
continuity between what's going on and
what<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.620> see<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.069> going<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.900> really<00:03:26.900> even<00:03:27.530> in

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
what I see is going on really even in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.129 
what I see is going on really even in
the<00:03:27.769> physics<00:03:28.129> engine<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.670> halo<00:03:29.120> what<00:03:29.930> I'm

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
the physics engine of halo what I'm

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.649 
the physics engine of halo what I'm
seeing<00:03:30.500> right<00:03:30.560> now<00:03:30.739> makes<00:03:31.159> sense<00:03:31.519> she's<00:03:32.480> in

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
seeing right now makes sense she's in

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.589 
seeing right now makes sense she's in
Lund<00:03:32.900> range<00:03:33.260> she<00:03:33.709> took<00:03:33.889> a<00:03:34.010> lunge<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.519> me<00:03:34.599> there

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
Lund range she took a lunge at me there

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.479 
Lund range she took a lunge at me there
was<00:03:35.720> too<00:03:35.959> much<00:03:36.079> distance<00:03:36.650> too<00:03:36.889> many<00:03:37.069> objects

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
was too much distance too many objects

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.360 
was too much distance too many objects
in<00:03:37.639> between<00:03:38.049> stops<00:03:39.049> short<00:03:39.409> mrs.<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.129> lunge

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
in between stops short mrs. the lunge

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.420 
in between stops short mrs. the lunge
that<00:03:40.879> makes<00:03:41.150> perfect<00:03:41.480> sense<00:03:41.799> she's<00:03:42.799> still<00:03:42.980> on

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
that makes perfect sense she's still on

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.289 
that makes perfect sense she's still on
here<00:03:44.000> she's<00:03:44.690> on<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.230> platform<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.250> then<00:03:47.090> all

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
here she's on this platform and then all

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.900 
here she's on this platform and then all
of<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.510> sudden<00:03:47.540> she's<00:03:48.440> looking<00:03:48.769> up<00:03:48.980> as<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.639> she

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
of a sudden she's looking up as if she

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.220 
of a sudden she's looking up as if she
fell<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:52.030> three<00:03:53.030> seconds<00:03:53.720> later<00:03:53.780> it's

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
fell and then three seconds later it's

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.439 
fell and then three seconds later it's
like<00:03:54.410> oh<00:03:54.590> she<00:03:54.919> did<00:03:55.099> fall<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:56.000> let's<00:03:56.180> put<00:03:56.389> her

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
like oh she did fall so let's put her

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.970 
like oh she did fall so let's put her
down<00:03:56.480> there<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.109> know<00:03:57.349> what<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.739> must<00:03:57.859> be

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
down there I know what you must be

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.159 
down there I know what you must be
saying<00:03:58.340> it's<00:03:58.609> just<00:03:58.849> lay<00:03:59.090> she<00:03:59.510> wasn't<00:03:59.840> there

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
saying it's just lay she wasn't there
