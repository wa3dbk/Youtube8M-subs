00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.660
 in motorcycles per thousand you are used to 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.710
 that we test the bikes by the system 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.780
 traditional combustion 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.980
 it's time we start thinking and 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.350
 open our minds to new 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.080
 mobility possibilities for it 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.970
 we have turned to an expert journalist 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.330
 in the sustainable mobility system 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.770
 indicated a tongue in joy was already 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 Yes, of course, yes, because 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.930
 there are other ways to move we can 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.310
 use bikes that do not make noise and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.110
 they need electricity the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.579
 electricity to take us through the 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.829
 road and you'll see what sensations so 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.050
 fun and exactly how it works 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.220
 the electric motorcycle because of course 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.109
 apparently it is very similar to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.690
 traditional combustion we have 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.070
 taken all my life but of course how 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 it works really work I'm 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.170
 convinced that many of you have 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 played with the scalextric way 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.030
 Electric motorcillo what 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.650
 demanding energy to move and to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.930
 turn that energy into movement 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.480
 Rotating electric motorcycles is 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.550
 exactly the same or very similar to a 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.080
 electric motor in this case without 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.430
 brushes you remember the motors of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.750
 download if you had quotes that happens 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.210
 with this type of brush motor 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.490
 that there is more friction and wear 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.410
 before now they are already being used 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.050
 brushless motors in English brasl 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.670
 is that having no friction have 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.440
 when the truth is that they are very very 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.330
 longevity do not have any kind of 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.680
 maintenance and the only thing that they require 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080
 is the energy that in the case of 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.399
 motorcycles is stored in batteries the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.960
 question that surely they will be 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.670
 making many of the viewers is 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.170
 the same as I'm doing for 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.350
 example I can live on the outskirts of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.180
 a big capital and I buy a scooter 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.080
 because I work in the center of that 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.090
 capital 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.039
 every day I go from about 30 to 40 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.680
 kilometers to work and I'll go back to 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.630
 home 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.190
 many people believe that the problem that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.920
 can have this type of vehicle is the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.800
 autonomy is that true 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.510
 that can autonomy can have a 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.610
 function will effectively effect the 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.000
 autonomy is essential to know the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 autonomy at the time of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.730
 acquire an electric vehicle 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.200
 any one electric vehicle is 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.870
 fundamental to know what your 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.119
 needs for autonomy and planning 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.679
 the recharging points in this case 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.120
 domestic plug because for a motorbike 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.280
 electrical does not need more than a 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.680
 domestic plug by a standard plug 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 an ordinary plug because the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.340
 energy demand is very poquita ago 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.110
 an idea that we are talking about less 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.670
 50 cents per 100 kilometers 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.170
 locking we pay the energy for loading 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 the mobile that's because all the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 public plugs and in the centers 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.530
 commercial and on the streets are 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.910
 I knew it free I need many 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.400
 points already recharged in many cities 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.130
 but it seems that you have to go pay 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.510
 for it's free it's free if some 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.489
 of them you need a card that 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.860
 you have to request for free 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.010
 identify yourself and no one unplugs you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.500
 when you are loading your motorcycle or had 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.080
 your electric car but you asked me 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.300
 about the autonomy of the motorcycle that 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.170
 you're going to try today is good of those 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.450
 more autonomy have 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.700
 scooter city and surroundings because 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.800
 allows to go within the 125 category 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.360
 cubic centimeters in which 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.650
 finds allows to go also by 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.540
 motorway with a speed is 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.060
 limited to 110 kilometers per hour has 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.489
 an autonomy around 150 maximum 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.920
 kilometers and if we demand a lot 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.310
 a lot of speed and therefore much 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.000
 energy would stay around 80 90 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.780
 kilometer 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.220
 I'm slow to get on, I think 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.480
 listening to your explanation but I have 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.000
 you want to prove that your actions 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.700
 have a motorcycle zilent llosa let's come 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.410
 go ahead let's train good 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.430
 we will start the motorcycle feeling 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.630
 is incredible 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.190
 of input absolute silence and according to me 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.440
 Ricardo has promised now when he gives 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.330
 the gas will start to work, there is no 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.860
 lose you take backwards as if 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.860
 they went to goal guys works 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.450
 what a weird feeling 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.390
 good 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.170
 silence is absolute the only thing 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.790
 we see at this moment it is the air who 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.310
 is talking in the helmet 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.069
 the rest to carry the batteries and everything 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.069
 mechanical element in the bottom 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.069
 we notice 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.039
 a very stable chassis 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.050
 certainly if it were not with silence 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.130
 Operating the difference between 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.330
 electric and the traditional combustion 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.330
 you practically do not notice 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.310
 wonderfully 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.020
 it's impressive is the acceleration that 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.020
 we accelerate 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.610
 learn 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.480
 and alone 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.880
 in my mind can problems 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.880
 no action like any other leg 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.430
 it's great 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.830
 at the level 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.690
 we will brake now we are generating this 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.850
 regenerating energy is loading the 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.560
 battery as if we got formula 1 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.560
 Alonso equal 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.050
 we liked the economy of use the 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.240
 Silence of march and its sustainability 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.430
 better we would make the purchase price a 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.150
 quality of finishes a little deficient and 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.150
 your limited autonomy 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.650
 it's amazing yes with a motorcycle like this all 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.599
 the days to work I think if it is 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.770
 greater and if you want the only difference 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.839
 what you have noticed is that I'm not going to 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.789
 absolutely nothing but the reactions 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.610
 the benefits everything has reminded me 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.770
 a motorcycle of a 125 scooter to the 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.120
 traditional silent combustion 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.969
 if you do not depend on gasoline, that 's what 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.639
 better the bike that is tested let's say 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.770
 is an average standard of quality and 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.569
 value for money in one allows you 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.789
 an autonomy that around 140 to 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.050
 150 kilometers with each load although if 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.520
 You are loading it throughout the day 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.900
 you can do more kilometers which is what 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.659
 yours as well whenever you are standing 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.330
 have it and loading is around 5 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:34.400
 thousand five thousand euros that yes the more the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.889
 you use cheaper you get it because in this 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.580
 case the fuel savings if it supposes 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.020
 look for your own bike in crisis 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.490
 what is very clear is that bikes 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:48.069
 thousand from now let's start 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.069
 also to try sustainable bikes
