think the guys are focused I know we

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.430 
think the guys are focused I know we
came<00:04:55.220> out<00:04:55.460> here<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.930> was<00:04:57.110> look

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
came out here and that was look

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.070 
came out here and that was look
especially<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:05.390> change<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.720> character

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
especially you change the character

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.240 
especially you change the character
series<00:05:06.590> when<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:06.830> first<00:05:07.340> came<00:05:11.980> it's<00:05:12.980> gonna<00:05:13.160> be

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
series when you first came it's gonna be

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.780 
series when you first came it's gonna be
a<00:05:13.280> serious

a serious

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.580 
a serious
I<00:05:14.740> guess<00:05:15.740> series<00:05:16.160> where<00:05:16.400> they're<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.210> good<00:05:17.510> team

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
I guess series where they're a good team

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.000

they're playing well I think that we're

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.070 
they're playing well I think that we're
a<00:05:22.040> decent<00:05:22.430> team<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.910> there's<00:05:23.750> no<00:05:23.870> good

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
a decent team and there's no good

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.580 
a decent team and there's no good
