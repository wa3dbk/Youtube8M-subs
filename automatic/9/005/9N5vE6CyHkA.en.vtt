00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
base form and stuff like that we'll see

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
base form and stuff like that we'll see
that's<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:54.120> like<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.720> in

that's the back and like you can see in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
that's the back and like you can see in
there<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.260> joints<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.800> they<00:01:55.950> don't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
there see the joints like they don't

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.610 
there see the joints like they don't
even<00:01:56.160> really<00:01:56.460> look<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.760> joints<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.500> way

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
even really look like joints the way

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.780 
even really look like joints the way
that<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:58.920> painted<00:01:59.340> them<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.580> kind<00:01:59.640> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that they painted them and kind of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.470 
that they painted them and kind of
integrated<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.390> details<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> joints

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
integrated the details into the joints

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060 
integrated the details into the joints
looks<00:02:03.480> really<00:02:03.690> good<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> was
