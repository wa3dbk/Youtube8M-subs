00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and that's something I'm we be looking

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
and that's something I'm we be looking
for<00:02:08.879> every<00:02:09.599> drone<00:02:09.810> counts<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.410> matchup

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
for every drone counts in this matchup

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.960 
for every drone counts in this matchup
so<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.069> more<00:02:11.220> than<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.580> any<00:02:12.030> other<00:02:12.120> matchup<00:02:12.629> I

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
so much more than in any other matchup I

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.480 
so much more than in any other matchup I
the<00:02:13.720> workers<00:02:14.080> are<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.950> rare<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.340> this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
the workers are just so rare in this

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.460 
the workers are just so rare in this
game<00:02:15.550> because<00:02:15.850> by<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.150> mid<00:02:16.330> game<00:02:16.480> usually<00:02:16.720> you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
game because by the mid game usually you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.350 
game because by the mid game usually you
don't<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.160> time<00:02:18.400> where<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> larvae<00:02:19.150> to

you<00:04:46.410> need<00:04:46.620> them<00:04:46.860> but<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:47.490> just<00:04:47.640> cost<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.240> much

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
you need them but they just cost so much

and<00:04:56.160> if<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.090> don't<00:04:57.300> absolutely<00:04:57.450> need<00:04:58.020> them

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
and if you don't absolutely need them

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.530 
and if you don't absolutely need them
especially<00:04:59.190> spore<00:04:59.730> colonies<00:05:00.150> which<00:05:00.300> require

that evolutionary chamber also usually
don't<00:05:03.390> want<00:05:03.600> them<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:04.170> looks<00:05:04.350> like<00:05:04.410> looks<00:05:05.160> like

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
don't want them it looks like looks like

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.900 
don't want them it looks like looks like

well at least whittle down the Zerg
listen<00:05:10.920> he's<00:05:11.010> got<00:05:11.160> two<00:05:11.310> zerglings<00:05:11.790> in<00:05:11.940> the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
listen he's got two zerglings in the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
listen he's got two zerglings in the
base<00:05:12.480> here<00:05:12.750> let's<00:05:12.930> see<00:05:12.990> if<00:05:13.050> he's<00:05:13.170> going<00:05:13.260> to

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
base here let's see if he's going to

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.620 
base here let's see if he's going to
take<00:05:13.470> down<00:05:13.590> each<00:05:13.800> drones<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:15.480> that's

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
take down each drones and that's

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.110 
take down each drones and that's
surprising<00:05:16.170> given<00:05:16.290> that<00:05:16.440> uh<00:05:16.910> silver<00:05:17.910> had<00:05:18.090> a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
surprising given that uh silver had a

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.500 
surprising given that uh silver had a
sunken<00:05:18.570> looks<00:05:18.720> like<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.900> gas<00:05:19.140> drunken<00:05:20.510> picked

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
sunken looks like a gas drunken picked

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.000 
sunken looks like a gas drunken picked
off<00:05:21.600> one<00:05:21.900> drone<00:05:22.140> but<00:05:22.320> you<00:05:22.410> know<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.650> that's<00:05:22.890> a

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
off one drone but you know that that's a

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.590 
off one drone but you know that that's a

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
mistake here from silver and silver

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.530 
mistake here from silver and silver
wasn't<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.650> know<00:05:25.740> he<00:05:25.890> wasn't<00:05:26.390> he's<00:05:27.390> you<00:05:27.510> know

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
a good player he retired but um it

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
player in the finals a little surprising

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.940 
player in the finals a little surprising
it's<00:05:33.090> time<00:05:33.270> for<00:05:33.480> when<00:05:33.600> i<00:05:33.660> read<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.050> he<00:05:34.470> was<00:05:34.650> in

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
it's time for when i read that he was in

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.760 
it's time for when i read that he was in
the<00:05:35.190> finals<00:05:35.720> but<00:05:36.720> savior<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:37.200> course<00:05:37.530> some

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
the finals but savior of course some

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.370 
the finals but savior of course some
this<00:05:38.250> was<00:05:38.460> i<00:05:38.700> believe<00:05:39.270> his<00:05:39.570> first<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:40.050> second

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
this was i believe his first or second

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.540 
this was i believe his first or second
final<00:05:40.620> so<00:05:40.710> i'm<00:05:40.770> not<00:05:40.830> sure<00:05:40.980> if<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.130> OSL<00:05:41.520> finals

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.600 
final so i'm not sure if the OSL finals
occurred<00:05:42.150> before<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.830> but<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:43.920> know<00:05:43.950> he<00:05:44.160> was
