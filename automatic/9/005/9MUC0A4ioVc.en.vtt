to<00:01:35.899> get<00:01:36.020> all<00:01:36.170> these<00:01:36.320> different<00:01:36.530> defenses<00:01:37.369> so

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
to get all these different defenses so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.580 
to get all these different defenses so
you<00:01:37.670> will<00:01:37.969> also<00:01:38.210> have<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.719> ability<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.229> raid

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.620 
you will also have the ability to raid
yourself<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.340> again<00:01:41.000> there's<00:01:41.240> going<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.539> be

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
yourself and again there's going to be

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.359 
yourself and again there's going to be
different<00:01:41.990> defenses<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.740> different<00:01:43.159> walls

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
different defenses like different walls

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.789 
different defenses like different walls
and<00:01:43.759> things<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.420> sort<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.109> there's<00:01:45.679> also

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
going to be archers and troops who I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.719 
going to be archers and troops who I
guess<00:01:47.780> betrayed<00:01:48.170> against<00:01:48.679> you<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.039> also<00:01:49.490> help

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
guess betrayed against you and also help

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.459 
guess betrayed against you and also help
you<00:01:49.880> raid<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.659> those<00:01:50.869> are<00:01:50.990> some<00:01:51.109> really<00:01:51.320> cool

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
you raid so those are some really cool

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.020 
you raid so those are some really cool
features<00:01:51.679> but<00:01:52.009> as<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.280> right<00:01:52.429> now<00:01:52.490> guys<00:01:52.759> we

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
features but as of right now guys we

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.270 
features but as of right now guys we
only<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.600> barbarians<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.380> we<00:01:54.890> have<00:01:55.070> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
only have the barbarians and we have the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.010 
only have the barbarians and we have the
cannons<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.850> they're<00:01:55.999> only<00:01:56.270> spawn<00:01:56.539> eggs<00:01:56.810> so

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
cannons and they're only spawn eggs so

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.840 
cannons and they're only spawn eggs so
the<00:01:57.380> cannon<00:01:57.740> works<00:01:57.920> much<00:01:58.159> like<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.369> turn<00:01:58.670> you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the cannon works much like a turn you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.149 
the cannon works much like a turn you
just<00:01:59.030> throw<00:01:59.179> it<00:01:59.299> down<00:01:59.329> as<00:01:59.810> 20<00:02:00.409> health<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
just throw it down as 20 health and the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.069 
just throw it down as 20 health and the
barbarians<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.270> they<00:02:02.390> don't<00:02:02.539> even<00:02:02.659> attack

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
barbarians but they don't even attack

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.330 
barbarians but they don't even attack
that<00:02:03.289> house<00:02:03.409> right<00:02:03.649> now<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:03.890> assuming<00:02:04.219> in<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
that house right now I'm assuming in the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.469 
that house right now I'm assuming in the
future<00:02:04.579> they're<00:02:04.729> gonna<00:02:04.819> try<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.060> take<00:02:05.179> these

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
future they're gonna try to take these

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.760 
future they're gonna try to take these
things<00:02:05.749> down<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.020> maybe<00:02:06.259> that's<00:02:06.469> why<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.649> has

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
things down and maybe that's why it has

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.469 
things down and maybe that's why it has
health<00:02:07.039> I'm<00:02:07.670> pretty<00:02:07.939> sure<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.119> can<00:02:08.300> even

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
health I'm pretty sure you can even

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.279 
health I'm pretty sure you can even
break<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.810> yourself

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
break it yourself

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.960 
break it yourself
they<00:02:09.470> can't<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:09.830> damaged<00:02:10.220> there's<00:02:10.460> no<00:02:10.580> hitbox

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
they can't be damaged there's no hitbox

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.880 
they can't be damaged there's no hitbox
for<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:12.140> we'll<00:02:12.260> go<00:02:12.410> ahead<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.650> we'll

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
for it but we'll go ahead and we'll

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.200 
for it but we'll go ahead and we'll
throw<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.190> barbarians<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.880> pretty<00:02:14.060> much

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
throw in the barbarians and pretty much

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.480 
throw in the barbarians and pretty much
this<00:02:14.360> cannon<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.140> going<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.470> detect<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
this cannon is just going to detect the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.340 
this cannon is just going to detect the
Barbarian<00:02:17.150> probably<00:02:17.480> by<00:02:17.569> smell<00:02:17.900> because<00:02:18.260> you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
Barbarian probably by smell because you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.630 
Barbarian probably by smell because you
know<00:02:18.410> they<00:02:18.530> kind<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.830> smell<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.040> booty<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
know they kind of smell like booty and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.730 
know they kind of smell like booty and
so<00:02:20.420> pretty<00:02:20.630> much<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.930> smells<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.290> our<00:02:21.440> barons

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
so pretty much the smells of our barons

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.590 
so pretty much the smells of our barons
booty<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.490> then<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.850> starts<00:02:23.120> shooting<00:02:23.480> at

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
booty and then it starts shooting at

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.290 
booty and then it starts shooting at
them<00:02:23.810> no<00:02:24.350> but<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.710> all<00:02:24.800> seriousness<00:02:25.300> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
them no but in all seriousness the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.030 
them no but in all seriousness the
cannon<00:02:26.810> again<00:02:27.200> worse<00:02:27.440> they<00:02:27.560> could<00:02:27.590> turn<00:02:27.860> at

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
cannon again worse they could turn at

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.190 
cannon again worse they could turn at
the<00:02:28.160> text<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.610> barbarian<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.360> then<00:02:29.810> takes<00:02:30.049> him

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
the text of barbarian and then takes him

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.690 
the text of barbarian and then takes him
out<00:02:30.319> okay<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:30.769> they<00:02:30.920> kind<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.159> see<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.489> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
out okay so they kind of see that the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.880 
out okay so they kind of see that the
Barbarian<00:02:32.269> clearly

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
Barbarian clearly

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.230 
Barbarian clearly
away<00:02:33.040> from<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.490> turret<00:02:33.670> he<00:02:33.820> doesn't<00:02:34.090> try<00:02:34.180> to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
away from the turret he doesn't try to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.300 
away from the turret he doesn't try to
attack<00:02:34.540> or<00:02:34.720> anything<00:02:34.990> but<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:35.980> thing<00:02:36.160> has<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
attack or anything but this thing has a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.680 
attack or anything but this thing has a
pretty<00:02:36.580> good<00:02:36.730> reach<00:02:36.910> if<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.210> guy<00:02:37.360> could<00:02:37.540> get

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
pretty good reach if this guy could get

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.880 
pretty good reach if this guy could get
a<00:02:37.720> little<00:02:37.900> bit<00:02:38.020> further<00:02:38.260> away<00:02:38.410> you'll<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.800> at

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
a little bit further away you'll see at

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.100 
a little bit further away you'll see at
the<00:02:38.920> sink<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.280> kind<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.550> sniping<00:02:39.940> from<00:02:40.210> pretty

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
the sink it kind of sniping from pretty

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.510 
the sink it kind of sniping from pretty
far<00:02:41.170> away<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> think<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.860> could<00:02:41.980> even<00:02:42.160> hit<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.430> if

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
far away I think it could even hit up if

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.250 
far away I think it could even hit up if
I<00:02:42.610> put<00:02:42.760> him<00:02:42.850> like<00:02:42.970> right<00:02:43.150> here<00:02:43.420> it's<00:02:43.930> fairly

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
I put him like right here it's fairly

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.810 
I put him like right here it's fairly
accurate<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.860> mean<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.130> not<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.400> bad<00:02:45.580> this

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
accurate I mean it's not that bad this

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.940 
accurate I mean it's not that bad this
guy<00:02:45.970> kind<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.300> got<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> Jukes<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.830> know

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
accurate I mean it hits at least 50% of

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.680 
accurate I mean it hits at least 50% of
the<00:03:24.190> time<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.880> that's<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.630> a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
the time and that's you know it's a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.660 
the time and that's you know it's a
decent<00:03:26.080> range<00:03:26.230> right<00:03:26.500> there<00:03:26.530> understand<00:03:27.520> and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
decent range right there understand and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.310 
decent range right there understand and
still<00:03:27.820> usually<00:03:28.180> hit<00:03:28.300> some<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:29.170> it's<00:03:29.290> a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
still usually hit some and if it's a

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
still usually hit some and if it's a
little<00:03:29.440> closer<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:29.890> gonna<00:03:29.980> be<00:03:30.190> more

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
little closer it's gonna be more

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.550
