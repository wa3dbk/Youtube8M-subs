00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
guns so you know it there's been a lot

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.830 
guns so you know it there's been a lot
of<00:00:23.820> debate<00:00:25.220> recently<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.509> guys

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
of debate recently because as you guys

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.900 
of debate recently because as you guys
know<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.380> probably<00:00:29.009> should<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.399> if<00:00:29.640> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
know or probably should know if you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.639 
know or probably should know if you
don't<00:00:30.090> I'll<00:00:30.180> tell<00:00:30.270> you<00:00:30.509> right<00:00:30.540> now<00:00:30.689> every<00:00:31.529> time

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
don't I'll tell you right now every time

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.110 
don't I'll tell you right now every time
you<00:00:31.770> go<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:31.919> and<00:00:32.099> turn<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.669> counts<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you go down and turn it counts as a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
you go down and turn it counts as a
natural<00:00:33.510> down<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> leaderboards

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
natural down in your in the leaderboards

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.369 
natural down in your in the leaderboards
so<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> lowers<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.809> kill<00:00:37.050> /<00:00:37.079> down

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
so that lowers your your kill / down

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.889 
so that lowers your your kill / down
ratio<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.149> know<00:00:39.239> there's<00:00:39.450> been<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
ratio so you know there's been a lot of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
ratio so you know there's been a lot of
discussion<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.859> around<00:00:41.190> wherever<00:00:41.489> this

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
discussion going around wherever this

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.579 
discussion going around wherever this
will<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> rank<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.199> to<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
will actually do you rank you to the

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.450 
will actually do you rank you to the
shotgun<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.359> this<00:00:45.359> will<00:00:45.600> act<00:00:45.920> because<00:00:46.920> right

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
has that got me thinking is that maybe

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
has that got me thinking is that maybe
the<00:02:18.860> reason<00:02:19.010> y<00:02:19.370> de<00:02:19.520> split<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.940> into<00:02:20.090> two<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the reason y de split it into two is the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.280 
the reason y de split it into two is the
treyarch<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:23.180> doesn't<00:02:23.630> think<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
treyarch just doesn't think in the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.670 
treyarch just doesn't think in the
ranking<00:02:24.650> system<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.580> going<00:02:25.880> down<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.500> vs<00:02:27.500> is

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
ranking system that going down in vs is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.180 
ranking system that going down in vs is
as<00:02:28.010> important<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.450> coop

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190

turn into a zombie you know that's the

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.010

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
way the game goes huh I don't think

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.480 
way the game goes huh I don't think
they're<00:03:45.110> gonna<00:03:45.170> penalize<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.430> don't

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
they're gonna penalize you and I don't

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.590 
they're gonna penalize you and I don't
think<00:03:46.640> you're<00:03:46.760> going<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:46.940> list<00:03:47.120> your<00:03:47.209> shotguns

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
think you're going to list your shotguns

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.270 
think you're going to list your shotguns
to<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.290> might<00:03:48.470> let<00:03:48.620> your<00:03:48.800> shotguns<00:03:49.190> and

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
to that you might let your shotguns and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.460 
to that you might let your shotguns and
I<00:03:49.340> think<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.850> whole<00:03:50.090> discussion<00:03:50.930> about<00:03:51.290> it's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
I think the whole discussion about it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.840 
I think the whole discussion about it's
because<00:03:51.680> people<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:52.340> been<00:03:52.459> loosing

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
because people have been loosing

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.120 
because people have been loosing
shotguns<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.630> don't<00:03:54.260> think<00:03:54.320> as<00:03:54.560> much<00:03:54.590> pick<00:03:55.010> as<00:03:55.100> a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
shotguns I don't think as much pick as a

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.740 
shotguns I don't think as much pick as a
plane<00:03:55.400> turn<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.820> think<00:03:56.030> as<00:03:56.150> much<00:03:56.180> for<00:03:56.510> playing

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
plane turn I think as much for playing

that you've worked for all this time

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.879 
that you've worked for all this time
just<00:04:23.040> because<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.169> really<00:04:25.169> gets<00:04:25.740> me

just because of that so really gets me

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.860 
just because of that so really gets me
thinking<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.790> think<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.419> only<00:04:27.540> KD

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
thinking and I think that the only KD

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.400 
thinking and I think that the only KD
that<00:04:28.229> really<00:04:28.590> truly<00:04:28.889> matters<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.340> your<00:04:29.460> coop

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
that really truly matters is your coop

that really truly matters is your coop
coop<00:04:31.410> KD<00:04:32.130> not<00:04:32.580> your<00:04:32.760> purse<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.180> kitty<00:04:33.419> I<00:04:33.770> think

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
coop KD not your purse is kitty I think

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.469 
coop KD not your purse is kitty I think
what<00:04:35.820> they<00:04:35.940> did<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:36.810> made<00:04:36.990> okay<00:04:37.410> co-op

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
what they did is to just made okay co-op

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.150 
what they did is to just made okay co-op
Mike<00:04:39.479> my<00:04:39.660> theory<00:04:40.050> at<00:04:40.110> least<00:04:40.139> has<00:04:40.500> just<00:04:40.800> co-op

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
Mike my theory at least has just co-op

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.540 
Mike my theory at least has just co-op
kds<00:04:41.550> what<00:04:41.910> really<00:04:42.120> counts<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:43.160> then<00:04:44.160> for<00:04:44.430> the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
kds what really counts and then for the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.939 
kds what really counts and then for the
vs.<00:04:44.940> it<00:04:45.120> just<00:04:45.330> wins<00:04:45.570> vs<00:04:46.169> loss<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.710> really

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
vs. it just wins vs loss that really

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.730 
vs. it just wins vs loss that really
counts<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.460> think<00:04:48.180> that's<00:04:48.360> really<00:04:48.510> what<00:04:48.900> what

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
counts I think that's really what what

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.840 
counts I think that's really what what
what<00:04:49.949> counts<00:04:50.250> because<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.550> wouldn't<00:04:50.760> make

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
what counts because it wouldn't make

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.909 
what counts because it wouldn't make
sense<00:04:50.910> for<00:04:51.270> them<00:04:51.510> to<00:04:51.539> give<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> new<00:04:52.680> game

sense for them to give you a new game

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.379 
sense for them to give you a new game
mode<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.280> then<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.550> hey<00:04:53.729> if<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.000> play<00:04:54.210> you're
