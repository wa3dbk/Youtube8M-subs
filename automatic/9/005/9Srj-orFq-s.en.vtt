 thoracic 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.470
 there is the measure that lowers feeling every time they have 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 take them backwards separate them and then forward 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.230
 the inspired 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.270
 Kiev circle your arms back to the side 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.510
 we are concentrating on two of the objectives of the gold class 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.350
 the strengthening of fats and greater vigor to toni nadal 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.090
 with caregivers soft movements and fat lie on the floor with the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.030
 arms on the side of the body and the knees bent 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.430
 dominates interests them but is a key factor in the exercise program of 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.699
 speed that is spoken now raises the right foot 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.699
 they estimate that in the leg at 90 degrees 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.719
 the left leg up 90 degrees 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.949
 danone 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.679
 again the right 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.559
 Concentrate on the movement 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.859
 Perez 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.689
 who want 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.689
 straw the very slowly 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.909
 this time we're going to repeat the whole exercise lifting it off the ground 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.119
 arms and head 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.119
 for those who 5-0 can stay in the initial position of the sequence 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.309
 previous 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.289
 felt a small contracture in the lower back 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.289
 that is not completely flat on the ground 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.649
 again the right 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.059
 the spine must be in a posture 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.489
 try not to force towards yourself or towards the feet with the pelvis 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.369
 lower your head and shoulders to rest on the floor 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.129
 keep contracted trujillo and correct the posture 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:19.089
 once again you have the option of boarding a taxi head 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.419
 so it's just beginning, you can leave them on the ground 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.419
 now his veto right leg and keeps 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.749
 now go up the left pimentel acts 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.109
 his right leg goes down 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.639
 then the left 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 and finally the torso and the head 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.549
 streep and that the sequence 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.020
 so it is very difficult 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.379
 Adopts the easiest posture 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.929
 I always remember to listen to your body 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.249
 I am aware of its limitations to avoid unnecessary injuries 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.830
 it's time to make some preparatory moves to make the closure 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.489
 raise the chin again and here the chest forward to lift both 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849
 psoe arms 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.199
 one hour on both legs of aouate 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.199
 you also have the option of leaving both feet on the floor 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.020
 and leave the selected ones at 90 degrees 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.169
 raise and lower your arms twenty times while doing small inspirations 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 evidently 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.999
 the lower legs and then the head and men 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.970
 lean on your spine and get ready to repeat the routine 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.840
 raise the torso 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 and the girls fall behind they will suffer the right leg 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.589
 and the left 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:11.449
 and again 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.159
 this exercise emphasizes breathing at chest level 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.539
 which allowed to develop resistance and coordination 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.280
 that's why this is one of the main exercises in the program 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.439
 now lower your legs each 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.619
 lean on your column and rest a moment 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.469
 3 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.469
 and now he prepares for the exercise dominates the 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.729
 all raise their torso head and also arms 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.529
 I did not have the right bliss towards the chest you were going to hold it with your hands 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:51.219
 the right hand on the left ankle on the knee exempts the left leg 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.389
 to form a 45 degree angle with the ground and we begin 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.419
 1 and the other 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.509
 2 and the other 3 and the other 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.309
 5 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.349
 6 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.139
 the left is flexed and we repeat once again 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.330
 well the movement six times 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.820
 the movement has to be done gracefully and you must externalize the leg as much 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.009
 As you can 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.259
 from this position it extends cords in the right leg 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.090
 Now we are going to work with both legs extended but if you are not yet 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.639
 elastic enough you can leave them flexed athens about 5 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.249
 change 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:41.820
 2 5 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.820
 believe excessive 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 Four. Five 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.719
 5 5 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.069
 one more 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.680
 and we stop 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.650
 Now with the left leg extended 90 degrees or as much as you can 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.360
 we will start one more time 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.800
 some son 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.830
 change 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.099
 two children 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:07.860
 3 5 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.259
 Four. Five 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.259
