00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
a great job in that program i think that

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.520 
a great job in that program i think that
program<00:00:46.090> has<00:00:46.239> really<00:00:46.449> stepped<00:00:46.750> up<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.140> compete

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
program has really stepped up to compete

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.220 
program has really stepped up to compete
a<00:00:47.679> lot<00:00:47.890> in<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.100> SEC<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:49.539> know<00:00:49.600> two<00:00:49.690> years<00:00:50.050> ago

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
a lot in the SEC you know two years ago

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.639 
a lot in the SEC you know two years ago
we<00:00:51.010> went<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.550> Lexington<00:00:52.089> to<00:00:52.120> play<00:00:52.420> them<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
we went to Lexington to play them that

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.660 
we went to Lexington to play them that
was<00:00:53.739> one<00:00:53.890> of<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:53.980> best<00:00:54.160> games<00:00:54.339> of<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.640> year

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
was one of the best games of the year

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.939 
was one of the best games of the year
when<00:00:55.600> they<00:00:55.750> had<00:00:55.929> Woodson<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.440> all<00:00:56.620> those<00:00:56.710> guys

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
when they had Woodson and all those guys

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.709 
when they had Woodson and all those guys
that<00:00:57.640> was<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.820> really<00:00:57.969> good<00:00:58.179> game<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.420> last

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
that was a really good game and last

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.119 
that was a really good game and last
year<00:00:58.960> we<00:00:59.109> really<00:00:59.320> jumped<00:00:59.620> on<00:00:59.710> him<00:00:59.859> early<00:01:00.100> and

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
year we really jumped on him early and

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.009 
year we really jumped on him early and
real<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.940> really<00:01:01.120> able<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.629> get<00:01:01.749> that<00:01:01.870> momentum

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
real it really able to get that momentum

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.720 
real it really able to get that momentum
going<00:01:02.499> so<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.739> think<00:01:02.949> that'll<00:01:03.190> be<00:01:03.280> another<00:01:03.489> goal

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
going so I think that'll be another goal

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.090 
going so I think that'll be another goal
this<00:01:03.879> year<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.230> get<00:01:05.560> on<00:01:05.650> him<00:01:05.800> early

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
this year is to is to get on him early

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.370 
this year is to is to get on him early
and<00:01:06.130> get<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.430> momentum<00:01:06.580> going<00:01:06.850> but<00:01:07.630> they're

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
and get the momentum going but they're

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.810 
and get the momentum going but they're
really<00:01:08.620> good<00:01:08.770> team<00:01:08.920> that<00:01:09.070> came<00:01:09.190> off<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.370> big<00:01:09.640> win

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
really good team that came off a big win

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.030 
really good team that came off a big win
over<00:01:09.880> Louisville<00:01:10.480> which<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.780> good<00:01:10.990> team<00:01:11.230> you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
over Louisville which is a good team you

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.250 
over Louisville which is a good team you
know<00:01:12.460> they<00:01:12.670> handled<00:01:13.060> Miami<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.600> Ohio<00:01:13.720> really

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
know they handled Miami of Ohio really

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.469 
know they handled Miami of Ohio really
well<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:15.340> they<00:01:15.460> got<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.610> lot<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.820> talent<00:01:16.210> on<00:01:16.270> both

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
well so they got a lot of talent on both

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.999 
well so they got a lot of talent on both
sides<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> ball<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.350> think<00:01:17.740> you're<00:01:17.860> going

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
sides of the ball I think you're going
