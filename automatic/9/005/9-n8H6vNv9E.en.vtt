00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
maybe it's a bit of a gimmick but then

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.360 
maybe it's a bit of a gimmick but then
the<00:03:48.150> lazy<00:03:48.780> kinda<00:03:49.560> emailed<00:03:49.859> me<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.069> said<00:03:50.160> that

stipple that over remove any excess and
just<00:04:18.690> stippling<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:21.200> means<00:04:22.200> you

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
just stippling it like this means you

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.110 
just stippling it like this means you
know<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.740> swiping<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.460> moving<00:04:23.820> any<00:04:23.940> other
