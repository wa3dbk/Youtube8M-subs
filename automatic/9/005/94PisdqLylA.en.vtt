00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
materials because we didn't want to

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.340 
materials because we didn't want to
destroy<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.240> main<00:04:47.449> world<00:04:47.690> look<00:04:47.870> see<00:04:48.169> this

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350

survival<00:04:52.970> world<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.300> we<00:04:53.449> create<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.960> survival

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
survival world so we create a survival

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.469 
survival world so we create a survival
expo<00:04:55.160> for<00:04:55.400> people<00:04:55.669> so<00:04:55.850> they<00:04:55.940> can<00:04:55.970> go<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.360> get

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
their materials and then go back to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.310 
their materials and then go back to
their<00:04:58.310> houses<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.789> use<00:04:59.300> their<00:04:59.479> materials<00:04:59.900> but
