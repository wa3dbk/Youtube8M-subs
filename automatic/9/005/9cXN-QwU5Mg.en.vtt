00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
correct which i am probably not but it's

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.149 
correct which i am probably not but it's
worth<00:03:16.450> try<00:03:16.750> anyway<00:03:17.819> if<00:03:19.439> this<00:03:20.439> may<00:03:20.709> completely

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
worth try anyway if this may completely

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.240 
worth try anyway if this may completely
