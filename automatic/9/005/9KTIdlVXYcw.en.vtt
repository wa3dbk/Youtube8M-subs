00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.660
 at a party 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:19.710
 Rabbit malyshev here it is new 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 cell does so and something here i'm here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.779
 what I'm doing here means to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.330
 increase the number of cells per area i 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 make them shorter 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.410
 guests meter twenty how they write everywhere 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.190
 we put it 70 centimeters that is 30 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 centimeters I miss getting 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:54.289
 30 there 40 I for that he is the hole thing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:54.289
 there there will be an added womb and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:10.939
 how many here in the series will be 7 from below 12 and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:16.580
 top 12 so how straight is you 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.580
 flow all the time many cells are done 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:33.729
 this 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:38.259
 there will be hinged queen cells this is not yet 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 finish this metal enters metal 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.869
 or a pallet such here 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 up and down necessarily 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.080
 mostly from lightning 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.869
 that which will be well yes ok 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.989
 It turns out how much something females 24 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:29.620
 females can be up to one side 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:31.360
 the left side and from the other side but still 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 here will be glazed means you will be 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:57.670
 that closed is understood by another construction 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:03:09.549
 well here on valin until it is done all 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:12.040
 everything gets done turns out 2 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.530
 I'm throwing them I'm tying if two 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.959
 cell floors 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.100
 Now this series has it not 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.299
 centimeter and a half naan thickness 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.630
 Tess no two and a half make up to 2 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.880
 about half you can do 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.609
 not a millimeter to a millimeter or even three 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.290
 centimeters and 4 centimeters which 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.930
 handy stuff all done i say 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.699
 there they do not go 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 to get nothing up to the bar 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:53.500
 time sergey go ahead again queen 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:59.669
 distance to distance here is well 131 , 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.669
 3 before so here I have merck such 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.109
 but here while in one row you have 5 in 1 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.900
 Well, in principle, you can 2 then 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.769
 letting 2-3 can be given seen with 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.829
 by time 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.590
 from livestock will still depend 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:22.590
 add this not long what you have 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:28.300
 breed mostly preferring site 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:32.100
 eaves last time attacks all sorts to him 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.100
 now let's see
