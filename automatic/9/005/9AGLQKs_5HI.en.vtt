 so you suddenly save your sh and that is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.180

 downgrade to your recess 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.950
 or far back this is important to you 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.939
 I make a backup you can do with 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 icloud 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.689
 or in itunes before you start using gio 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.640
 pricks well when one is downloaded 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 it automatically in your fire or with downloads 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.829
 and then opening 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 what should you do then you should take care 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.590
 that you touch your iphone ipad or ipod with 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.070
 highway 7 and I'll connect you to the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.439
 computer 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 i have for clarity and ipad 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.770
 mini 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.780
 the first generation connected and you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.829
 also sees that when your program starts 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.229
 recognizes 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.430
 we currently have asc point number 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.479
 two on 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 then we can now start with 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 jailbreak i just push the button 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.090
 kubrick 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.799
 and then it's a matter of waiting and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.799
 then you will probably have some other ones 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.280
 ask things or there are nothing 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280
 have to do 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.280
 what they give as a tip is to the if 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.319
 you an iphone app with security code 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.170
 to reach for any of this code 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.170
 this can prevent problems for later 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 vice that think your iphone is ipod or ipad 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:00.110
 restart because it's okay you see 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.760
 also one of those parties now on your idevice 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.129
 but it is important that you still there 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.280
 not to this you just have to be patient 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.280
 to have 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.940
 Well 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.239
 the ipad is now what we restart 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.080
 now have to do is wait for the ipad 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.870
 booted up and then we need the app that 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.180
 it certainly insists on that fation 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.610
 boot up 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.209
 I'm on the ipad 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.500
 when state the iv chanel we print 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.030
 then in a tight that on screen and then 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.030
 it will restart again 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.420
 now i'm on with for the second time 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.420
 startup we should lure more 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:04.080
 shift more than they are critical 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.080
 final process 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.690
 minister 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.450
 again for the third time and she was 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.510
 well done with jailbreak 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.660
 that means that a cda will be on my 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.690
 ipad might be on you a year 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.130

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.770
