blackberries
for<00:00:09.430> we<00:00:10.430> haven't<00:00:10.670> set<00:00:10.850> our<00:00:10.880> bricks<00:00:11.270> so<00:00:11.900> what<00:00:11.990> we

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
for we haven't set our bricks so what we

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.160 
for we haven't set our bricks so what we
did<00:00:12.260> was<00:00:12.730> just<00:00:13.730> using<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.719> weight<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:15.049> this

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
did was just using the weight of this

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.740 
did was just using the weight of this
brick<00:00:15.469> told<00:00:16.219> the<00:00:16.400> string<00:00:16.700> along<00:00:16.970> its<00:00:17.210> side<00:00:17.450> we

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
brick told the string along its side we

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.150 
brick told the string along its side we
know<00:00:17.900> that<00:00:18.050> this<00:00:18.170> is<00:00:18.320> how<00:00:18.440> wide<00:00:18.680> it<00:00:18.890> will<00:00:18.980> be

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
know that this is how wide it will be

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.850 
know that this is how wide it will be
you<00:00:19.880> know<00:00:20.000> how<00:00:20.119> wide<00:00:20.330> this<00:00:20.480> will<00:00:20.660> be<00:00:20.840> way<00:00:21.800> too

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
you know how wide this will be way too

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.250 
you know how wide this will be way too
this<00:00:22.130> brick<00:00:22.369> here<00:00:22.640> to<00:00:22.760> hold<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.060> string<00:00:23.360> so<00:00:24.140> we

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
this brick here to hold the string so we

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.590 
this brick here to hold the string so we
know<00:00:24.440> where<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.800> place<00:00:25.040> our<00:00:25.250> our<00:00:26.000> board<00:00:26.330> and

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
know where to place our our board and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.040 
know where to place our our board and
still<00:00:26.870> have<00:00:27.140> our<00:00:27.890> walkway<00:00:28.840> finish<00:00:29.840> digging

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
still have our walkway finish digging

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.620 
still have our walkway finish digging
the<00:00:30.260> holes

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.380 

we<00:00:35.200> could

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
we could

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.430 
we could
our<00:00:37.870> levels<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:40.360> against<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.020> make<00:00:41.170> sure<00:00:41.290> is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
our levels up against it to make sure is

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.560 
our levels up against it to make sure is
plumb

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.260 

we<00:00:47.570> got<00:00:47.750> concrete<00:00:48.260> poured<00:00:48.590> or<00:00:49.490> we<00:00:49.880> didn't<00:00:50.150> put

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
we got concrete poured or we didn't put

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.260 
we got concrete poured or we didn't put
a<00:00:50.300> lot<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.540> concrete<00:00:51.050> in

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.510 

so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.470 

and<00:00:58.110> there's<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.230> very<00:00:59.260> sunny<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.550> we're<00:01:00.700> plumb

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.970 

a<00:01:22.630> new<00:01:23.630> plum<00:01:24.850> anyway<00:01:26.290> once<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:27.470> concrete

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
a new plum anyway once this concrete

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.320 
a new plum anyway once this concrete
sets<00:01:28.280> up<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:28.700> not<00:01:28.910> fast<00:01:29.270> concrete<00:01:30.130> but

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
sets up it's not fast concrete but

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.090 
sets up it's not fast concrete but
here's<00:01:32.330> one<00:01:32.510> of<00:01:32.600> those<00:01:32.770> tool<00:01:33.770> tips<00:01:34.040> for<00:01:34.310> you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
here's one of those tool tips for you

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.900 
here's one of those tool tips for you
when<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.190> pour<00:01:37.750> post<00:01:38.750> holes<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.980> can<00:01:40.010> pre<00:01:40.670> mix

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
when you pour post holes you can pre mix

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.030 
when you pour post holes you can pre mix
it<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> wheelbarrow<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.590> box<00:01:42.830> or

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it in the wheelbarrow or in a box or

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.870 
it in the wheelbarrow or in a box or
something<00:01:43.190> if<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.520> want<00:01:43.780> or<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:45.610> just<00:01:46.610> do<00:01:46.850> it

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
something if you want or you just do it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.220 
something if you want or you just do it
the<00:01:47.000> way<00:01:47.180> they've<00:01:47.390> always<00:01:47.510> done<00:01:47.870> it<00:01:48.020> for<00:01:48.200> a

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
the way they've always done it for a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.930 
the way they've always done it for a
long<00:01:48.380> time<00:01:48.590> that's<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.190> way<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.430> Romans<00:01:49.730> did

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
long time that's the way the Romans did

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.560 
long time that's the way the Romans did
it<00:01:50.030> too<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:51.500> you'll<00:01:51.710> put<00:01:51.920> your<00:01:51.950> mix<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.540> do<00:01:53.540> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
it too is you'll put your mix in do a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.650 
it too is you'll put your mix in do a
premix<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.820> height<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:56.210> want<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
premix to the height that you want and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.050 
premix to the height that you want and
then<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.500> pour<00:01:57.830> your<00:01:57.920> water<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.340> top<00:01:58.580> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
then you pour your water on top and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.850 
then you pour your water on top and
osmosis<00:01:59.510> will<00:01:59.960> just<00:02:00.140> draw<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.470> down<00:02:00.650> that's

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
osmosis will just draw it down that's

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.430 
osmosis will just draw it down that's
what<00:02:01.070> we've<00:02:01.190> been<00:02:01.310> doing<00:02:03.400> that's<00:02:04.400> why<00:02:04.580> there's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
what we've been doing that's why there's

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.109 
what we've been doing that's why there's
it's<00:02:06.440> still<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> little<00:02:07.340> bit<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.520> water<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.910> here

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's still a little bit of water in here

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.130 
it's still a little bit of water in here
I<00:02:08.149> don't<00:02:08.330> know<00:02:08.420> if<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:08.810> see

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.700 

and<00:02:13.680> any<00:02:13.860> excess<00:02:14.520> water<00:02:15.020> will<00:02:16.020> be<00:02:16.140> drawn<00:02:16.410> into

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and any excess water will be drawn into

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.000 
and any excess water will be drawn into
the<00:02:17.040> soil<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> always<00:02:19.530> get<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.860> right

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the soil and so you always get the right

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.250 
the soil and so you always get the right
amount<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.520> mean<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.090> can<00:02:21.390> put<00:02:21.720> too<00:02:21.900> much<00:02:22.020> water

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
amount I mean you can put too much water

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.880 
amount I mean you can put too much water
in

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.030 

but<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.540> actually<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> lot<00:02:28.319> harder<00:02:28.380> do<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
but this is actually a lot harder do I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.559 
but this is actually a lot harder do I
mean<00:02:29.250> you'd<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.940> fill<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
mean you'd have to just fill it all the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.750 
mean you'd have to just fill it all the
way<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.230> come<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> put<00:02:32.520> more

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
way up and then come back and put more

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.000 
way up and then come back and put more
in<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.180> more<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> morning<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.230> that's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
in and more in the morning and that's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.870 
in and more in the morning and that's
not<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> way<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.410> anyway<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.760> our

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
not the way to do it anyway this is our

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.780 
not the way to do it anyway this is our
pre-shift<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.569> all<00:02:40.310> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.340> put<00:02:41.760> our

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
pre-shift it's all going to put our

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.750 
pre-shift it's all going to put our
blackberries<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.770> our<00:02:43.890> 50-50<00:02:44.520> mix

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
blackberries in we can do our 50-50 mix

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.680 
blackberries in we can do our 50-50 mix
then<00:02:45.440> anyways<00:02:46.440> we're<00:02:47.040> gonna<00:02:47.450> we've<00:02:48.450> started

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
then anyways we're gonna we've started

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140 
then anyways we're gonna we've started
our<00:02:48.930> trellis<00:02:49.380> I've<00:02:50.340> changed<00:02:50.670> your<00:02:50.820> mind<00:02:51.000> on

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
our trellis I've changed your mind on

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.620 
our trellis I've changed your mind on
the<00:02:51.270> design<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.650> how<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:54.390> grape

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the design I really like how the grape

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.030 
the design I really like how the grape
trellis<00:02:54.930> has<00:02:55.230> turned<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.860> what<00:02:55.950> they

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
trellis has turned out and what they

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.410 
trellis has turned out and what they
look<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.730> will<00:02:56.880> kind<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.150> keep<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
look like and this will kind of keep the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.350 
look like and this will kind of keep the
same<00:02:57.630> theme<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.940> will<00:03:00.060> do<00:03:00.209> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
same theme going and so it will do is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.900 
same theme going and so it will do is
we'll<00:03:01.290> put<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> top<00:03:01.739> across<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.459> at<00:03:02.610> six

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
we'll put a top across this is at six

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.250 
we'll put a top across this is at six
feet<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:05.540> there's<00:03:06.540> really<00:03:06.750> no<00:03:06.989> right<00:03:07.230> or

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
feet and there's really no right or

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
feet and there's really no right or
wrong<00:03:07.530> way<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.769> do<00:03:08.040> these<00:03:08.190> these<00:03:08.550> blackberries

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
wrong way to do these these blackberries

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.630 
wrong way to do these these blackberries
are<00:03:09.720> prolific<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.010> only<00:03:11.190> thing<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.459> want<00:03:11.610> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
are prolific the only thing you want to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.949 
are prolific the only thing you want to
remember<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:12.000> not<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.209> cut<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.660> less<00:03:12.930> than

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
remember is not to cut them less than

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.949 
remember is not to cut them less than
two<00:03:13.380> feet<00:03:13.620> low<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.300> what<00:03:15.450> we're<00:03:15.570> going<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.780> do

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
two feet low so what we're going to do

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.460 
two feet low so what we're going to do
is<00:03:16.739> oh<00:03:16.980> come<00:03:17.010> about<00:03:17.459> two<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.940> half<00:03:17.970> feet

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
is oh come about two and a half feet

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.130 
is oh come about two and a half feet
then<00:03:19.470> we're<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.769> put<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.980> line<00:03:20.790> across

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
then we're going to put a line across

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.870 
then we're going to put a line across
will<00:03:22.140> come<00:03:22.290> up<00:03:22.410> about<00:03:22.560> six<00:03:22.830> more<00:03:23.100> inches<00:03:23.250> put<00:03:23.850> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
will come up about six more inches put a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.990 
will come up about six more inches put a
line<00:03:24.090> across<00:03:24.500> another<00:03:25.500> maybe<00:03:26.250> six<00:03:26.580> inches<00:03:26.760> or

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
line across another maybe six inches or

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.780 
line across another maybe six inches or
8<00:03:27.150> or<00:03:27.180> whatever<00:03:27.600> we'll<00:03:28.350> divide<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:28.980> then

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
8 or whatever we'll divide it and then

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.640 
8 or whatever we'll divide it and then
we'll<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.329> one<00:03:30.540> across<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.840> top<00:03:31.170> along<00:03:31.500> with

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
we'll have one across the top along with

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.330 
we'll have one across the top along with
the<00:03:31.739> board<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:34.220> when<00:03:35.220> you

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the board now what you do is when you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.640 
the board now what you do is when you
get<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> height<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.880> your<00:03:36.090> wire<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.440> cut

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
get to the height of your wire you cut

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.289 
get to the height of your wire you cut
it<00:03:37.769> an<00:03:37.890> inch<00:03:38.130> or<00:03:38.310> two<00:03:38.340> below<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.030> you'll<00:03:39.150> put

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
it an inch or two below and you'll put

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.600 
it an inch or two below and you'll put
out<00:03:39.480> runners<00:03:39.840> it'll<00:03:40.410> stop<00:03:40.650> vertical<00:03:41.400> growth

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
out runners it'll stop vertical growth

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.729 
out runners it'll stop vertical growth
and<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.940> will<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.150> horizontal<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.320> then<00:03:43.530> take

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
and it will go horizontal you then take

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.800 
and it will go horizontal you then take
those<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.519> kind<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.790> wrap<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.120> around<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.660> tie

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
those you kind of wrap it around and tie

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.340 
those you kind of wrap it around and tie
it<00:03:45.840> on<00:03:46.140> until<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.280> reaches<00:03:47.579> your<00:03:47.610> other<00:03:47.850> end

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
it on until it reaches your other end

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.020 
it on until it reaches your other end
then<00:03:49.350> you'll<00:03:49.500> cut<00:03:49.799> them<00:03:50.010> again<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.790> when<00:03:50.940> you

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
then you'll cut them again and when you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
then you'll cut them again and when you
do<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.840> will<00:03:51.959> stop<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.200> horizontal<00:03:52.829> growth

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
do it will stop the horizontal growth

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.330 
do it will stop the horizontal growth
even<00:03:53.220> though<00:03:54.200> it's<00:03:55.200> over<00:03:55.530> here<00:03:55.769> it'll<00:03:56.010> then

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
even though it's over here it'll then

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.250 
even though it's over here it'll then
put<00:03:56.790> out<00:03:56.910> runners<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.510> what<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.870> thinks<00:03:58.110> this

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
put out runners and what it thinks this

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.430 
put out runners and what it thinks this
horizontal<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.400> you've<00:03:59.579> laid<00:03:59.790> down<00:03:59.970> now

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
horizontal that you've laid down now

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.370 
horizontal that you've laid down now
will<00:04:01.440> you'll<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.100> train<00:04:02.430> both<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:04.230> your

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
will you'll just train both up to your

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.180 
will you'll just train both up to your
next<00:04:04.620> wire<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.209> just<00:04:06.209> wrap<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.450> around<00:04:07.190> and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
next wire and just wrap it around and

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.860 
next wire and just wrap it around and
you<00:04:08.519> just<00:04:08.700> keep<00:04:08.880> doing<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.329> until<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:09.780> all

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
you just keep doing that until it's all

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.270 
you just keep doing that until it's all
the<00:04:09.959> way<00:04:09.989> at<00:04:10.079> top<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.590> then<00:04:10.709> when<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
the way at top and then when it's at the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.580 
the way at top and then when it's at the
top<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:12.180> cut<00:04:12.420> off<00:04:12.600> your<00:04:12.630> your<00:04:13.140> terminal

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
top you cut off your your terminal

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.190 
top you cut off your your terminal
growth<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.430> shoot<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.510> will<00:04:15.600> stop<00:04:15.900> growing

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
growth the shoot so it will stop growing

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.319 
growth the shoot so it will stop growing
and<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:17.280> all<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.489> energy<00:04:17.789> will<00:04:18.090> go<00:04:18.209> into

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
and then all the energy will go into

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.440 
and then all the energy will go into
fruit<00:04:18.630> production<00:04:19.250> anyway<00:04:20.250> that's<00:04:21.150> where

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
fruit production anyway that's where

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.990 
fruit production anyway that's where
we're<00:04:21.600> at<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.810> that's<00:04:21.930> our<00:04:22.169> plan<00:04:22.789> be<00:04:23.789> applied

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
we're at and that's our plan be applied
