that<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.190> see<00:02:29.430> over<00:02:29.819> in<00:02:29.910> two<00:02:30.030> different

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
that you can see over in two different

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300 
that you can see over in two different
spaces<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.989> doesn't<00:02:31.200> look<00:02:31.319> -<00:02:31.560> doesn't

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
spaces but it doesn't look - doesn't

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.820 
spaces but it doesn't look - doesn't
look<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.430> an<00:02:32.640> office<00:02:32.940> doesn't<00:02:33.209> look<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
look like an office doesn't look like a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.680 
look like an office doesn't look like a
train<00:02:34.830> station<00:02:34.860> concourse<00:02:35.519> which<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.060> call<00:02:36.480> -

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
train station concourse which we call -

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.690 
train station concourse which we call -
could<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.049> been<00:02:37.230> inferred<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> put<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:38.400> solid

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
could have been inferred to put a solid

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.030 
could have been inferred to put a solid
black<00:02:39.480> roof<00:02:39.780> over<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.140> top<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
black roof over the top of it and so we

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.520 
black roof over the top of it and so we
designed<00:02:41.190> these<00:02:41.580> North<00:02:42.239> lights<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.380> made

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
designed these North lights and made

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.289 
designed these North lights and made
them<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.860> very<00:02:44.040> sculptural<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> looks

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
them very very sculptural so it looks

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.420 
them very very sculptural so it looks
more<00:02:45.569> kin<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> whole<00:02:46.769> form<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
more kin to the whole form of the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.180 
more kin to the whole form of the
building<00:02:47.790> itself<00:02:48.269> we<00:02:48.900> had<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.290> completely

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
building itself we had to completely

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.990 
building itself we had to completely
accuse<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> isolate<00:02:51.299> all<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
accuse the isolate all of the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.280 
accuse the isolate all of the
performance<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.180> teaching<00:02:54.299> spaces<00:02:54.959> so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
performance and teaching spaces so

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.870 
performance and teaching spaces so
they're<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.530> box<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.069> box<00:02:56.250> color<00:02:56.489> options

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
they're all box in box color options

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.420 
they're all box in box color options
which<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.329> basically<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.079> building<00:02:59.069> within<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
which are basically a building within a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.240 
which are basically a building within a
building<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.780> goes<00:03:01.019> down<00:03:01.200> from<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
building and that goes down from the the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.699 
building and that goes down from the the
large<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.239> console<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.780> recital<00:03:04.200> halls<00:03:04.380> all

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
large the console and recital halls all

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.270 
large the console and recital halls all
the<00:03:04.890> way<00:03:05.010> down<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.010> small

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the way down to the to the to the small

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.580 
the way down to the to the to the small
teaching<00:03:08.910> practice<00:03:09.269> rooms<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
teaching practice rooms but what that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.440 
teaching practice rooms but what that
helped<00:03:10.890> us<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.220> was<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.579> create<00:03:11.700> these<00:03:11.970> really

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
helped us do was to create these really

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.349 
helped us do was to create these really
deep<00:03:12.750> reveals<00:03:13.230> because<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.579> created<00:03:15.000> deep

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
deep reveals because it created deep

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.000 
deep reveals because it created deep
reveals<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> windows<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.530> also<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
reveals on the windows but also for the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280 
reveals on the windows but also for the
doors<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.150> quite<00:03:18.299> interesting<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.079> terms

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
doors so it's quite interesting in terms

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.750 
doors so it's quite interesting in terms
of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> experience<00:03:20.160> when<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.340> walk<00:03:20.459> down<00:03:20.639> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
of the experience when you walk down the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580 
of the experience when you walk down the
corridors<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.299> don't<00:03:21.510> see<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.170> doors<00:03:22.350> you

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
corridors you don't see the doors you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.440 
corridors you don't see the doors you
see<00:03:22.769> these<00:03:22.920> big<00:03:23.190> carved<00:03:23.609> openings<00:03:24.060> which<00:03:24.269> is

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
see these big carved openings which is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.360 
see these big carved openings which is
something<00:03:25.019> similar<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.829> get<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.100> in

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
something similar to what you get in in

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.299 
something similar to what you get in in
the<00:03:26.549> medieval<00:03:26.940> buildings
