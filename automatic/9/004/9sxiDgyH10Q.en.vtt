00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.880
 Hey folks of the grammy-winner Master and Riesch I cheered my export 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.690
 Steinert sexy game collection 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.490
 and it's just fire it will be a short video since i dont because many 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.879
 Player for the Xbox 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.570
 from grandma to first rank 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.659
 and it is 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.039
 it is extremely critical 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.300
 around 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.160
 I'll say I can do too much for the sprinter now 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.640
 two proofs 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.529
 around 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.060
 I do not have any express rail then because I'm not that ex-boxer either 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.510
 namely there are such great games behind 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.850
 it goes to break Horner 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.180
 and yes, so it's war can Kurt play a role 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.480
 and I also found Porsche modern good and I'm looking forward to about when he 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 I was great with the Denmark Open 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 there, then 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 you run around in the city and then 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.730
 this aggressive man 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 Content Sinntaler Poses opponents so there will be able to attack everything around the earth 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.270
 back but became Chancellor too 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.640
 I'll just say while you hit her she can torture herself 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.770
 So who has to heal even full throttle is none mitkriegt 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.380
 and it is already quite impressive and you do not have to 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 hide and run around on houses and jump up and soest 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.469
 that's just how it is more like that later on 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.880
 So I would say yes yes 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 you can look at yourself 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.720
 5 0 2 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.970
 Game number two 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.000
 in fact 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.650
 here before 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.440
 around 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.970
 so it is 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.990
 taken care of by the shooter 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.420
 SchÃ¼tte bag station 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420
 so you call yourself and rent Rome 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.320
 but it melted away 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.020
 and there's a co-op mode making 3 percent copernicium 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.040
 Too hot on this famous chain saw this chain ring pistol 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.770
 Soap theme 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.289
 this machine guns and that and now evidence bear with that in ours 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.670
 Distributor Schleicher of the cult 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.800
 and 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.760
 So, good games of hateful do not have to be played 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.280
 but I think they better protect me now 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.209
 something like that already became instant 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.369
 and the owner Escom LLC Games 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.509
 yes, too 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.359
 Name the last hope 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.349
 from Square Enix Sound 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.770
 yes, why I have this game is probably because it is from Square Enix 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.809
 as a channel donations 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:34.849
 and there he is already strangers too fast many choose per 1 for power 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.409
 quite Brentano and 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.149
 Green FDP stands holding two gas between 1 and how it works 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.769
 Petrak is because everything is being implemented here 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.969
 So driving a lot is a graphic is very good before the game 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.859
 and also the system is everything we want it knows when you look at it 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:51.599
 knows 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.069
 and small scenes 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.559
 yes that you live it all where 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.669
 and although the us-tor can circulate around data the opponents of known free 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.599
 For the attack on dragged objects use whatever you do 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.449
 want 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.619
 He has not reached that far, even if he would like to 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.989
 but yes 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.459
 Reports that Ulrich Wallin had Xbox there 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.669
 which may not take that much longer 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.669
 I think so now I hope 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:25.599
 and that was my class m40 for collection and clearly the youngest and the 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.169
 next day
