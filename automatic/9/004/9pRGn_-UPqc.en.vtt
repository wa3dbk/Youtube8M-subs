00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.190
 hello the other day of the company 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.969
 introduced her phablet heavyweight htc 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.620
 one max 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.320
 compared to the huge screen 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.840
 Taiwanese giant even samsung galaxy 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.700
 note 3 look like a midget be led and 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.490
 clearly selected once 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.230
 design line you minivan ivan max 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.360
 this is a different format variation of one 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.240
 smartphone with slight differences in 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.850
 characteristics so framing you less 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.190
 max made of plastic they are aluminum 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.200
 what honor sevan power button 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.870
 moved from the top edge of the smartphone 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.870
 on the right side of the case otherwise before it 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.310
 it would be impossible to reach at all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.170
 there is an infrared sensor on top 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.720
 which turns the device into 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.730
 universal remote control LCD 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.399
 batteries can be removed by pressing the lever on 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.010
 you will find slots on the right side under it 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.809
 for micro sd and micro sim despite 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.239
 removable lid made of one piece 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.340
 piece of aluminum htc one max battery 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.430
 traditionally remained slim 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.680
 htc one max a half times harder than you 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.380
 not to mention how much more 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.330
 take a look at them versus weight in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.310
 two hundred and seventeen grams phablet from 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.070
 be treated and will be one of the most difficult 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.530
 mobile devices on the market direct 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.420
 competitor van max samsung galaxy music 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.650
 looks much less due to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 refined frames lcd 3 htc one display 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.080
 max versus million feet screen with 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.060
 it seems rather dark manufacturers 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.420
 sacrificed brightness that you save 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.659
 one max battery is equipped with an operating 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.670
 the android system jellybin 43 and the newest 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.360
 htc user firmware version 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.729
 sense 5 5 in the blinkfeed function added 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.619
 redlight he but much more important that himself 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.670
 home screen blinkfeed now possible 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.220
 deactivate with one touch of the htc button 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.990
 one max is equipped with a biometric sensor 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.430
 on the back which allows 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.280
 unlock device 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.110
 swiping the sensor three times 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.060
 your fingerprint and you can create a password 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.340
 in case the sensor suddenly 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.009
 you can blunt different fingers 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 assign different functions 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.519
 and quick start pointing to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.319
 example camera average for example browser 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.239
 van max shoots at 4 megapixel 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.269
 ultrapixel camera technology 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.310
 and records video in full hd when recording 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.530
 Video is available in dual shooting mode with 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 front and main camera 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.549
 incomprehensible reasons won max not received 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.190
 optical image stabilizer 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.739
 which by the way improves the quality of images 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.629
 with poor lighting in a classic van 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.489
 such a stabilizer is therefore 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.879
 the decision of the manufacturer seems a bit 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.920
 weird smartphone runs fast and 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.409
 no delay quality graphics in real 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.959
 racing 3 on wan max was not inferior 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.400
 but inside on samsung the game doesn't load 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.310
 much faster 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.299
 but believe me you will not notice the difference 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.980
 picky critics may recall 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.400
 learn and weaker processor 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.340
 snapdragon 600 vs. snapdragon 800 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.049
 inside but again the difference is visible only on 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.690
 paper actually speed devices 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.329
 almost identical to the first fa 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.579
 blend poke si lacks weight 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.919
 battery size is darkish 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.440
 screen is a slightly outdated processor and 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.010
 no image stabilizer on 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.680
 to the side 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.989
 eat sevan max design processing choice 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.030
 materials and multimedia features 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.400
 overall, max max produces good 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.650
 impression however success to him we 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.959
 we cannot yet predict reviews of others 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.489
 smartphones and tablets you will always find 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.489
