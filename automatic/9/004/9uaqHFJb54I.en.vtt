00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.759 
as much the taste and common sense as I
can<00:02:32.880> but<00:02:33.299> at<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> same<00:02:33.720> time<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.109> like<00:02:34.560> what<00:02:34.739> I

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
can but at the same time I like what I

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.789 
can but at the same time I like what I
play<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.130> be<00:02:35.459> interesting<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.209> and

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
play to be interesting and and

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.710 
play to be interesting and and
unpredictable<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.579> what<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.730> mean<00:02:38.910> so

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
unpredictable you know what I mean so

00:02:39.720 --> 00:05:14.100 
unpredictable you know what I mean so
say<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.620> instance<00:02:41.120> let's<00:02:42.120> take

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.930 

I'm<00:05:15.110> using<00:05:15.320> a<00:05:15.500> combination<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:16.280> things<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:16.820> I

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
I'm using a combination of things that I

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.240 
I'm using a combination of things that I
know<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.660> things<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.320> like<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:18.889> like<00:05:19.100> to

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
know and things that I like so I like to

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:37.360 
know and things that I like so I like to
surprise<00:05:19.400> you

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.280 

instead<00:05:37.910> of<00:05:38.030> staying<00:05:38.270> in<00:05:38.450> G<00:05:38.690> he<00:05:38.990> went<00:05:39.169> into

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
instead of staying in G he went into

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.700 
instead of staying in G he went into
c-sharp<00:05:40.990> he's<00:05:41.990> going<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.200> creates<00:05:45.560> that

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
c-sharp he's going and it creates that

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.780 
c-sharp he's going and it creates that
tension<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:48.080> I'm<00:05:48.680> using<00:05:48.950> a<00:05:49.070> combination<00:05:49.310> of

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
tension so I'm using a combination of

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.210 
tension so I'm using a combination of
things<00:05:50.240> I've<00:05:50.450> learned<00:05:50.750> things<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:51.830> feel<00:05:52.040> like

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
things I've learned things I feel like

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.090 
things I've learned things I feel like
playing<00:05:52.460> in<00:05:52.729> this<00:05:52.850> moment<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:53.750> whatever

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:11.080 

right<00:05:58.270> everything<00:06:09.490> no<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.520> didn't<00:06:10.940> get<00:06:11.030> a

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
right everything no I didn't get a

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.460 
right everything no I didn't get a
chance<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.419> warm<00:06:11.690> up<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:13.010> I<00:06:13.070> came<00:06:13.130> here
