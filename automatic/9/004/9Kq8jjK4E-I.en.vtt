then you get this pretty nice mountain
range<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.270> huge<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.199> pretty<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:22.680> if

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
range not huge but it's pretty good if

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.740 
range not huge but it's pretty good if
you<00:00:23.550> go<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> little<00:00:23.820> bit<00:00:24.000> further<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> rather

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you go a little bit further and rather

Pit<00:00:25.140> one<00:00:25.470> yes<00:00:26.400> 19<00:00:27.029> multiple<00:00:27.510> if<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:29.070> keep

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
Pit one yes 19 multiple if you keep

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.299 
Pit one yes 19 multiple if you keep
going<00:00:29.609> straight<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.269> will<00:00:30.420> find<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.130> other

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
going straight you will find the other

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.010 
going straight you will find the other
map<00:00:32.550> range<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.780> bigger

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
in a little bit more extreme I guess you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.840
