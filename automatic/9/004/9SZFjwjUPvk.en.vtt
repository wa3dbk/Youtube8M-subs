jumping<00:03:08.430> all<00:03:08.639> over<00:03:08.669> but<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.510> got<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.719> be

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
jumping all over but you got to be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.420 
jumping all over but you got to be
careful<00:03:09.930> use<00:03:10.620> your<00:03:10.739> other<00:03:10.859> thumb<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.250> push

down<00:03:11.699> on<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.090> blade<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:13.919> cuts

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
down on the blade so that it cuts

down on the blade so that it cuts
through<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.549> does<00:03:14.669> require<00:03:14.909> some<00:03:15.090> force<00:03:15.739> so

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
through it does require some force so

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.539 
through it does require some force so
you're<00:03:16.829> gonna<00:03:16.919> want<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.189> put<00:03:17.310> your<00:03:17.430> weight

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
you're gonna want to put your weight

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 
likely I don't weigh that much now you

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.780 
likely I don't weigh that much now you
want<00:03:25.439> to<00:03:25.500> keep<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.889> all<00:03:26.159> around<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.639> might

around<00:03:28.199> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.379> bun

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
around on the bun

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.349 
around on the bun
probably<00:03:29.699> know<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:30.000> there's<00:03:30.239> probably

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
probably know that there's probably

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.530 
probably know that there's probably
still<00:03:30.720> little<00:03:30.930> tags<00:03:31.970> little<00:03:32.970> places<00:03:33.209> where

still little tags little places where
you<00:03:33.599> didn't<00:03:33.810> quite<00:03:34.079> cut<00:03:34.379> through<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.189> want

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you didn't quite cut through so you want

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.369 
you didn't quite cut through so you want
to<00:03:35.370> keep<00:03:35.519> cutting<00:03:35.939> until<00:03:36.209> you're<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.109> hundred

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
to keep cutting until you're a hundred

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.719 
to keep cutting until you're a hundred
percent<00:03:37.799> sure<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:40.829> gonna<00:03:40.979> have<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.519> nice

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
little circle fall out of here what do

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.860 
little circle fall out of here what do
you<00:03:45.780> pick<00:03:46.109> up<00:03:46.939> alright<00:03:47.939> pretty<00:03:48.209> sure<00:03:48.449> I<00:03:48.479> got<00:03:48.689> it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
you pick up alright pretty sure I got it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.089 
you pick up alright pretty sure I got it
if<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.530> didn't

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
if I didn't

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.219 
if I didn't
I<00:03:50.129> can<00:03:50.909> always<00:03:51.030> line<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.479> spike<00:03:51.750> up<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.109> just

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
I can always line the spike up I'm just

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.659 
I can always line the spike up I'm just
kind<00:03:52.379> of<00:03:52.439> feel<00:03:52.650> her<00:03:52.799> eyelid<00:03:53.069> until<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> spike

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
kind of feel her eyelid until the spike

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.670 
kind of feel her eyelid until the spike
sinks<00:03:54.090> back<00:03:54.329> into<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.780> hole<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.290> started

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
sinks back into the hole that I started

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.499 
sinks back into the hole that I started
with<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:56.819> could<00:03:57.000> be<00:03:57.150> difficult

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.209 

there<00:04:00.509> we<00:04:00.599> go<00:04:00.719> but<00:04:01.290> now<00:04:01.379> I<00:04:01.409> got<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.680> dividing<00:04:02.099> it

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
there we go but now I got it dividing it

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.380 
there we go but now I got it dividing it
so<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.819> could<00:04:03.150> go<00:04:03.299> around<00:04:03.419> and<00:04:03.719> do<00:04:03.840> additional

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
so I could go around and do additional

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.040 
so I could go around and do additional
I<00:04:04.420> needed<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:07.180> looks<00:04:07.330> like<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.569> do<00:04:07.630> right

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
I needed to it looks like I do right

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.059 
I needed to it looks like I do right
here<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.350> still<00:04:08.500> cut<00:04:08.770> all<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:08.950> way<00:04:09.010> through

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
here it still cut all the way through

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.420 
here it still cut all the way through
never<00:04:09.850> take<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.569> circle<00:04:10.990> and<00:04:11.200> strip<00:04:11.620> it'll

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
never take the circle and strip it'll

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.430 
never take the circle and strip it'll
probably<00:04:12.610> tear<00:04:13.030> all<00:04:13.120> right<00:04:13.240> a<00:04:13.270> new<00:04:13.480> baster

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
probably tear all right a new baster

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:23.870 
probably tear all right a new baster
I<00:04:14.470> made<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.370> mistake<00:04:15.480> numerous<00:04:16.480> times

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.920 

that's<00:04:24.880> how<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.090> should<00:04:25.180> do<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.390> just<00:04:25.690> pick<00:04:25.900> it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
that's how you should do it just pick it

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.050 
that's how you should do it just pick it
up<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.070> circle<00:04:27.370> stands<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.850> ground

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
up and the circle stands on the ground

up and the circle stands on the ground
if<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.660> do<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.960> way<00:04:29.020> we'll<00:04:29.680> get<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.980> right

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
if you do it that way we'll get it right

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.310 
if you do it that way we'll get it right
you've<00:04:31.060> got<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> nice<00:04:31.390> beautiful<00:04:31.750> perfectly

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
you've got a nice beautiful perfectly

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
port of that if you'd like you could buy

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.770 
port of that if you'd like you could buy
something<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:36.060> aquarium<00:04:37.060> sticker<00:04:37.450> based
