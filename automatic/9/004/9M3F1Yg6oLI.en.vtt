00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.000
 The people found you guilty of committing 123 first-degree murders 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.950
 and for 123 unauthorized journeys to parallel universes. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.800
 There's never been someone like me before. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.800
 You have been sentenced to death for these crimes. No appeal. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.800
 Are you ready? 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.100
 And you? 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.400
 Do not move! 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.700
 He's running away. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 There is only one place to go. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 Seamlessly. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.250
 What if there was a killer traveling through parallel universes 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 and he looked like you. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 The good news is you're not crazy. And the bad one ... 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.400
 Even before I saw him, I felt him. He's me. 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.800
 What if you couldn't do anything against it 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 not to take your world. 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.500
 JET LI 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.200
 He kills himself at different times to draw their life energy and strength. 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.400
 DELROY LINDO 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.600
 Where does the power come from? 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.950
 CARLA GUGINOVÁ 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.100
 We have to find out what's wrong with you. 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.000
 People just don't get old, they're not faster or stronger. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600
 JASON STATHAM 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.400
 Kill him. And his whole world will go with him. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I'll probably have to do it again. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.900
 This is the only way to stop it. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.000
 My own design. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 Fine, too. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 FROM REVOLUTION STUDIOS 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.000
 AND FILM DIRECTOR UNRELATED FATE 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.600
 Did you miss me? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.200
 ONLY ONE 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.500
 WILL BE 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
