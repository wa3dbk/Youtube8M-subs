editing capabilities I'll take a look at
the<00:00:27.599> reasons<00:00:28.310> first<00:00:29.310> we'll<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.240> just

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the reasons first we'll do is we're just

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.590 
the reasons first we'll do is we're just
done<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:31.470> gonna<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.679> waiting<00:00:31.800> remedy<00:00:32.399> them

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and we'll see that we have several

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
and we'll see that we have several
levels<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.410> scale<00:00:37.800> suppression<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.460> this

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
levels of scale suppression at this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
levels of scale suppression at this
level<00:00:38.879> we're<00:00:39.600> seeing<00:00:39.629> our<00:00:40.200> black<00:00:40.440> outlines

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

seeing our services also note that at
this<00:00:55.620> point<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> six<00:00:56.489> inch<00:00:56.670> cast<00:00:56.969> iron

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this point we have a six inch cast iron

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.779 
this point we have a six inch cast iron
pipe<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> zoom<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.680> more<00:00:58.829> time<00:00:59.070> let's<00:00:59.699> see

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
pipe and zoom it one more time let's see

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
pipe and zoom it one more time let's see
the<00:01:00.000> lid<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.629> changes<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> show<00:01:01.320> us

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the lid one actually changes to show us

the<00:01:01.680> installed<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.180> three

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the installed in this one I have three

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.910 
the installed in this one I have three
most<00:01:03.600> important<00:01:04.019> things<00:01:04.229> about<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.739> water

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
most important things about the water

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
most important things about the water
cups<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.939> take<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> bookmark<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
cups so if we take the bookmark that you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
cups so if we take the bookmark that you
find<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.200> map<00:01:10.350> document<00:01:10.950> there's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.580> place

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
find in the map document there's a place

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
find in the map document there's a place
where<00:01:12.090> there's<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.390> empty<00:01:12.710> space<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.920> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
where there's some empty space where we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.649 
where there's some empty space where we
might<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> enter<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.850> some<00:01:14.880> data<00:01:15.270> let's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
might need to enter in some data let's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
might need to enter in some data let's
see<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:16.200> place<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> show<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
see that's a good place to show off the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.480 
see that's a good place to show off the
tools<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.500> start<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.040> adding<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
tools so we're gonna start by adding the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
tools so we're gonna start by adding the
pipe<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.000> begins<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> cuz<00:01:21.659> system<00:01:22.350> Bob<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
pipe that begins to cuz system Bob you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.280 
pipe that begins to cuz system Bob you
see<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> longer<00:01:23.340> corner<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.080> we're<00:01:25.170> going

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
see in a longer corner and we're going

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.690 
see in a longer corner and we're going
to<00:01:25.320> trace<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.670> trace<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:28.700> outline

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to trace a little trace is the outline

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.230 
to trace a little trace is the outline
this<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.259> block<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.490> use<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.119> our

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
this of this block so we use that as our

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.140 
this of this block so we use that as our
offset<00:01:33.720> them

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
offset them

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
offset them
you're<00:01:36.150> gonna<00:01:36.240> offset<00:01:36.509> distance<00:01:42.710> ten<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.159> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you're gonna offset distance ten so it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.660 
you're gonna offset distance ten so it
follows<00:01:44.520> along<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.810> need<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.670> I'm

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
follows along we need it to and I'm

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.340 
follows along we need it to and I'm
already<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.540> ahead<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> tell<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
already we can go ahead and tell it that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
already we can go ahead and tell it that
we<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.920> snap<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.430> them<00:01:51.320> just<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> punk<00:01:53.030> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
we want to snap to them just a punk like

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.399 
we want to snap to them just a punk like
then<00:01:59.090> we've<00:02:00.090> added<00:02:00.240> our<00:02:00.479> first<00:02:00.509> feature<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
then we've added our first feature and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.929 
then we've added our first feature and
they<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> default<00:02:02.340> values<00:02:02.790> initially

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
they got the default values initially

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.120 
they got the default values initially
and<00:02:04.479> let<00:02:04.630> me<00:02:04.719> see<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.960> diameter<00:02:05.170> sets<00:02:05.740> 12

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
and let me see the diameter sets 12

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.139 
and let me see the diameter sets 12
we'll<00:02:06.310> go<00:02:06.399> ahead<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.729> change<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.110> 8<00:02:08.110> inch

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
we'll go ahead and change that 8 inch

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.250 
we'll go ahead and change that 8 inch
the<00:02:10.149> most<00:02:10.330> important<00:02:10.660> thing<00:02:10.810> here<00:02:10.959> though<00:02:11.110> is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the most important thing here though is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.390 
the most important thing here though is
that<00:02:11.290> there<00:02:11.560> are<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> couple<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.980> other<00:02:12.220> things

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that there are a couple of other things

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.220 
that there are a couple of other things
happening<00:02:12.970> going<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:13.569> behind<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.930> scenes

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
happening going on behind the scenes

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.979 
happening going on behind the scenes
personally<00:02:15.160> we're<00:02:15.370> getting<00:02:15.610> our<00:02:15.760> update<00:02:16.209> date

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
personally we're getting our update date

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.550 
personally we're getting our update date
last<00:02:17.410> updated<00:02:17.890> its<00:02:18.069> updated<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:19.560> editor

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
last updated its updated and the editor

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.589 
last updated its updated and the editor
we're<00:02:21.190> also<00:02:21.340> now<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.910> place<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.299> enter<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
we're also now have place to enter in

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.880 
we're also now have place to enter in
our<00:02:22.629> install<00:02:23.140> day<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.650> say<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
our install day and you just say that

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.470 
our install day and you just say that
everything<00:02:27.129> that<00:02:27.280> we're<00:02:27.459> adding<00:02:27.879> right<00:02:28.299> now

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
everything that we're adding right now

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.740 
everything that we're adding right now
was<00:02:29.489> originally<00:02:30.489> installed<00:02:30.760> beginning<00:02:31.660> in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
was originally installed beginning in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.979 
was originally installed beginning in
February<00:02:32.170> 2009

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
February 2009

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.059 
February 2009
so<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.110> would<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.230> important<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:35.769> if<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
so that would be important because if it

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.740 
so that would be important because if it
as<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.430> add<00:02:36.579> additional<00:02:37.030> features<00:02:37.269> we'll<00:02:37.599> see

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
as we add additional features we'll see

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.350 
as we add additional features we'll see
how<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.079> diner<00:02:38.470> genders<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.069> over<00:02:39.329> go<00:02:40.329> ahead

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
how that diner genders in over go ahead

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.800 
how that diner genders in over go ahead
now<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:41.470> add<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> couple<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.810> system

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
now and really add a couple of system

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.270 
now and really add a couple of system
valves<00:02:46.170> these<00:02:47.170> are<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.379> to<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.890> added<00:02:48.190> over

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
valves these are going to be added over

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.009 
valves these are going to be added over
here<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.790> let's<00:02:48.940> go<00:02:49.390> window<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.840> make<00:02:49.930> it

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
here so let's go window and make it

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.670 
here so let's go window and make it
really<00:02:50.140> easy<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.379> see<00:02:50.590> what<00:02:50.739> we're<00:02:50.890> doing<00:02:50.980> here

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
really easy to see what we're doing here

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.030 
really easy to see what we're doing here
we're<00:02:53.680> going<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.860> start<00:02:54.099> at<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.340> Junction

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
we're going to start at that Junction

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.190 
we're going to start at that Junction
say<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.220> we<00:02:57.340> need<00:02:57.519> add<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.540> system<00:02:58.989> valve

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
say that we need add a system valve

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.180 
say that we need add a system valve
exactly<00:02:59.769> 12<00:03:00.069> feet<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.730> pipe<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.829> another

exactly 12 feet on that pipe on another

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.440 
exactly 12 feet on that pipe on another
one<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.489> other<00:03:03.579> direction<00:03:09.209> both<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.329> them

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
one in the other direction both of them

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.379 
one in the other direction both of them
espoused<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.019> turn<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.730> take<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> look<00:03:13.239> at

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
espoused in turn you can take a look at

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.150 
espoused in turn you can take a look at
the<00:03:13.480> attribute<00:03:13.870> values<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.560> see<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
the attribute values and see that the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.150 
the attribute values and see that the
valve<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:20.109> is<00:03:20.230> here<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> 10<00:03:20.859> inch<00:03:21.040> drop

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
valve it is here on the 10 inch drop

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.870 
valve it is here on the 10 inch drop
Dorn<00:03:21.430> pipe

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
Dorn pipe

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.110 
Dorn pipe
it's<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.269> diameter<00:03:22.599> of<00:03:22.840> 10<00:03:23.079> inches<00:03:23.940> push<00:03:24.940> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
it's a diameter of 10 inches push the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.960 
it's a diameter of 10 inches push the
other<00:03:25.150> bow<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:26.829> just<00:03:27.010> entered<00:03:27.190> pipe<00:03:27.849> that

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
other bow that we just entered pipe that

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.610 
other bow that we just entered pipe that
we<00:03:28.030> just<00:03:28.180> entered<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.870> diner<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.470> eight

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
we just entered it's a diner and eight

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.870 
we just entered it's a diner and eight
inches<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.069> that's<00:03:30.160> picking<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.639> the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
inches so that's picking up the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.300 
inches so that's picking up the
attributes<00:03:31.299> from<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.569> underline<00:03:31.900> on<00:03:32.230> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
attributes from the underline on that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.979 
attributes from the underline on that
man<00:03:33.310> capability<00:03:34.150> exists<00:03:34.510> for<00:03:34.630> other<00:03:34.750> features

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
man capability exists for other features

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.539 
man capability exists for other features
as<00:03:35.260> well<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.620> we'll<00:03:35.739> see<00:03:35.919> how<00:03:36.069> we<00:03:36.130> can<00:03:36.340> pull

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
as well and we'll see how we can pull

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.190 
as well and we'll see how we can pull
information<00:03:36.730> from<00:03:37.120> other<00:03:37.359> letters<00:03:37.750> hazard<00:03:38.079> in

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
things that were automatically

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.520 
things that were automatically
populating<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.299> system<00:03:43.660> boss<00:03:43.840> include

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
populating on the system boss include

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.750 
populating on the system boss include
the<00:03:44.650> install<00:03:45.010> date<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.340> we<00:03:45.430> entered<00:03:45.609> in<00:03:45.730> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
the install date that we entered in to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.220 
the install date that we entered in to
begin<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.359> so<00:03:46.569> that's<00:03:46.720> occurring<00:03:47.049> across

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
begin with so that's occurring across

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.809 
begin with so that's occurring across
any<00:03:47.620> other<00:03:47.709> features<00:03:48.099> at<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.400> enter<00:03:48.639> right

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
any other features at the enter right

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.120 
any other features at the enter right
now<00:03:49.030> it'll<00:03:49.900> pick<00:03:50.079> up<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.290> last<00:03:50.440> value<00:03:50.769> for

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
now it'll pick up the last value for

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.460 
now it'll pick up the last value for
that<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.730> can<00:03:51.880> set<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.540> 50<00:03:53.049> last<00:03:53.200> value

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
that we can set that up to 50 last value

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
that we can set that up to 50 last value
some<00:03:53.680> other<00:03:53.889> fields<00:03:54.430> as<00:03:54.519> well

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.370 

so<00:03:57.760> after<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.329> entering<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> system<00:03:59.079> most

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
so after and entering in the system most

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.619 
so after and entering in the system most
next<00:03:59.709> one<00:03:59.859> we<00:04:00.040> looked<00:04:00.220> at<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.609> how<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.269> connect

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
next one we looked at is how to connect

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.080 
next one we looked at is how to connect
these<00:04:01.750> meters<00:04:02.139> that<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.349> see<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.859> here<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.940> our

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
these meters that you see in here to our

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.000 
these meters that you see in here to our
pipes<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:05.169> let's<00:04:05.379> go<00:04:05.470> ahead<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.799> just<00:04:05.889> select

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
pipes so let's go ahead and just select

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.199 
pipes so let's go ahead and just select
all<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.579> meters<00:04:08.549> there's<00:04:09.549> these<00:04:09.819> two<00:04:09.879> down

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
all of the meters there's these two down

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.150 
all of the meters there's these two down
here<00:04:10.419> as<00:04:10.540> well<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.349> with<00:04:11.500> all<00:04:11.709> four<00:04:12.009> of<00:04:12.039> those

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
here as well and with all four of those

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.870 
here as well and with all four of those
meters<00:04:12.400> selected

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
meters selected

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.699 
meters selected
if<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.000> click<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.360> button<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:16.350> it--let

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
if you click the button to on it--let

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.710 
if you click the button to on it--let
add<00:04:16.890> service'<00:04:17.430> lateral<00:04:17.730> lines<00:04:17.910> let's<00:04:18.600> see

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
add service' lateral lines let's see

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.449 
add service' lateral lines let's see
that<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.930> goes<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.380> finds<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.769> closest<00:04:20.220> pipe

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that it goes and finds the closest pipe

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.400 
that it goes and finds the closest pipe
each<00:04:20.730> of<00:04:20.910> those<00:04:21.000> meters<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.570> draws<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.109> lot<00:04:22.380> of

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
each of those meters and draws a lot of

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.290 
each of those meters and draws a lot of
a<00:04:22.560> line<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.920> connect<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.240> is

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
a line to connect it so this is

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.750 
a line to connect it so this is
important<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:24.960> other<00:04:25.830> analysis<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.460> might<00:04:26.610> do

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
important for other analysis we might do

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.760 
important for other analysis we might do
later<00:04:26.910> like<00:04:27.210> isolation<00:04:27.630> traces<00:04:28.260> or<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.620> one

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
later like isolation traces or the one

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.980 
later like isolation traces or the one
out<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.220> consumption<00:04:29.880> values<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.600> important

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
out of consumption values it's important

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.840 
out of consumption values it's important
to<00:04:31.080> associating<00:04:31.650> with<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.860> correct<00:04:32.160> pipe<00:04:32.430> I

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
to associating with the correct pipe I

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.820 
to associating with the correct pipe I
noticed<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.780> this<00:04:33.900> one<00:04:34.140> connected<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
noticed that this one connected to the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.290 
noticed that this one connected to the
pipe<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.160> was<00:04:35.310> already<00:04:35.520> there<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.850> tend<00:04:36.270> to

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
pipe that was already there that tend to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.120 
pipe that was already there that tend to
stop<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.660> line<00:04:36.810> tight<00:04:37.140> but<00:04:37.620> if<00:04:37.710> instead<00:04:37.860> we

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
stop the line tight but if instead we

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.710 
stop the line tight but if instead we
really<00:04:38.520> meant<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.970> connect<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:39.480> pipe

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
really meant it to connect to this pipe

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.360 
really meant it to connect to this pipe
down<00:04:39.900> here<00:04:40.080> what<00:04:40.260> we<00:04:40.350> can<00:04:40.470> do<00:04:40.590> is<00:04:40.710> just<00:04:40.890> click

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
down here what we can do is just click

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.860 
down here what we can do is just click
on<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.610> meter<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:41.910> click<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.390> particular

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
on the meter and click that particular

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.020 
on the meter and click that particular
pipe<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.470> instead<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.340> going<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.670> closest

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
pipe and instead of going to the closest

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.740 
pipe and instead of going to the closest
pipe<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:46.050> Pat<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.380> selected<00:04:47.390> so<00:04:48.390> we've<00:04:48.600> entered

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
pipe I Pat is selected so we've entered

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.750 
pipe I Pat is selected so we've entered
in<00:04:48.930> our<00:04:49.020> lateral<00:04:49.470> lines<00:04:49.620> per<00:04:49.830> meters<00:04:50.250> what<00:04:50.700> do

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
in our lateral lines per meters what do

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.210 
in our lateral lines per meters what do
we<00:04:50.850> have<00:04:50.970> left<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.390> add<00:04:51.540> we<00:04:52.260> need<00:04:52.440> fire

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
we have left to add we need fire

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.820 
we have left to add we need fire
hydrants<00:04:53.850> areas<00:04:54.240> it's<00:04:54.600> okay<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.290> have<00:04:55.530> one<00:04:55.710> of

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
hydrants areas it's okay and have one of

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.880 
hydrants areas it's okay and have one of
those<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:57.480> we<00:04:57.810> will<00:04:57.960> measure<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.290> distance<00:04:58.530> from

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
those so we will measure a distance from

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.700 
those so we will measure a distance from
an<00:04:59.070> existing<00:04:59.250> file<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.940> from<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.810> 22<00:05:04.380> feet

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
an existing file and from that 22 feet

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.920 
an existing file and from that 22 feet
you<00:05:05.430> will<00:05:05.550> start<00:05:05.820> there<00:05:06.060> until<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:06.840> we

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
you will start there until it that we

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.110 
you will start there until it that we
want<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.320> measure<00:05:07.470> that<00:05:08.340> location<00:05:08.970> we're

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
want to measure that location we're

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.760 
want to measure that location we're
going<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.360> go<00:05:09.450> inward<00:05:09.900> towards<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.320> property

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
going to go inward towards that property

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.360 
going to go inward towards that property
and<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.490> parallel<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.800> specified<00:05:13.800> length<00:05:14.070> one

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
and a parallel and specified length one

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.270 
and a parallel and specified length one
more<00:05:14.520> time<00:05:16.340> exactly<00:05:17.370> 2016<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:19.100> to<00:05:20.100> that

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
more time exactly 2016 in to that

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.430 
more time exactly 2016 in to that
property<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:21.000> put<00:05:21.870> their<00:05:22.020> neck<00:05:22.140> throat<00:05:22.320> to

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
property and put their neck throat to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.100 
property and put their neck throat to
that<00:05:22.590> one<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:24.330> we<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.540> around<00:05:24.810> hydrant

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
that one so we that around hydrant

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.330 
that one so we that around hydrant
that's<00:05:25.290> just<00:05:25.500> part<00:05:25.950> of<00:05:25.980> it<00:05:26.070> out-of-the-box

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
that's just part of it out-of-the-box

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.980 
that's just part of it out-of-the-box
tools<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.060> ability<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.450> add<00:05:27.630> behind

tools the ability to add behind
everything<00:05:28.260> that's<00:05:28.530> sort<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.830> precision<00:05:29.100> but

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
everything that's sort of precision but

part of the template that we downloaded

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.130 
part of the template that we downloaded
gives<00:05:32.310> us<00:05:32.430> this<00:05:32.640> button<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.240> go<00:05:33.630> ahead<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:33.960> add

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
gives us this button to go ahead and add

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.190 
gives us this button to go ahead and add
a<00:05:34.169> hydrant<00:05:34.680> lateral<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.729> when<00:05:35.910> we<00:05:36.030> do<00:05:36.150> that

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
a hydrant lateral so when we do that

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.909 
a hydrant lateral so when we do that
we're<00:05:37.200> going<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.380> see<00:05:37.530> some<00:05:37.710> additional

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
we're going to see some additional

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.770 
we're going to see some additional
things<00:05:38.370> happen<00:05:38.760> at<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:38.940> same<00:05:39.120> time<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:39.660> what

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
things happen at the same time so what

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.120 
things happen at the same time so what
am<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:39.990> looking<00:05:40.080> up<00:05:40.320> a<00:05:40.410> window<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:40.770> we<00:05:40.950> can<00:05:40.979> see

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
am I looking up a window so we can see

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.430 
am I looking up a window so we can see
will<00:05:41.430> also<00:05:41.880> what<00:05:42.090> it's<00:05:42.210> doing<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:42.570> hope<00:05:43.320> it

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
will also what it's doing so hope it

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.590 
will also what it's doing so hope it
isn't<00:05:43.560> under<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.160> do<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.520> we'll<00:05:45.210> click<00:05:45.450> this

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
isn't under to do that we'll click this

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.570 
isn't under to do that we'll click this
button<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.229> we'll<00:05:46.320> see<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:47.070> not<00:05:47.220> only<00:05:47.340> does

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
button and we'll see but not only does

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.950 
button and we'll see but not only does
it<00:05:47.640> add<00:05:47.880> a<00:05:48.240> hydrant

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
it add a hydrant

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.170 
it add a hydrant
zoom<00:05:49.500> in<00:05:49.620> a<00:05:49.650> little<00:05:49.830> bit<00:05:50.040> we'll<00:05:50.850> see<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.090> it

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
zoom in a little bit we'll see it it

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.060 
zoom in a little bit we'll see it it
also<00:05:51.419> gives<00:05:51.840> us<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.620> system<00:05:53.520> about<00:05:54.380> our<00:05:55.380> model

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
also gives us the system about our model

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.870 
also gives us the system about our model
so<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.360> can<00:05:58.080> also<00:05:58.229> click<00:05:58.470> they<00:05:58.680> rotate<00:05:59.460> selected

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
so I can also click they rotate selected

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.030 
so I can also click they rotate selected
junctions<00:06:00.270> button<00:06:01.140> and<00:06:01.350> that<00:06:01.470> will<00:06:01.500> make<00:06:01.830> sure

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
junctions button and that will make sure

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.820 
junctions button and that will make sure
that<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.310> item<00:06:02.610> feature<00:06:02.850> is<00:06:03.090> rotated<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:03.930> just

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
that the item feature is rotated so just

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.950 
that the item feature is rotated so just
position<00:06:05.400> correctly<00:06:05.880> that<00:06:06.180> rotate<00:06:06.540> function

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
position correctly that rotate function

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.420 
position correctly that rotate function
actually<00:06:07.229> works<00:06:07.410> for<00:06:07.470> all<00:06:07.650> sorts<00:06:07.919> of<00:06:08.100> features

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
actually works for all sorts of features

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.550 
actually works for all sorts of features
so<00:06:08.700> we<00:06:08.970> can<00:06:09.300> use<00:06:09.419> it<00:06:09.570> for<00:06:09.750> finding<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.410> center

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
so we can use it for finding the center

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.800 
so we can use it for finding the center
of<00:06:10.740> balance<00:06:10.919> they<00:06:11.760> a<00:06:11.790> notice<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.450> valves

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
of balance they a notice that the valves

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.520 
of balance they a notice that the valves
head<00:06:13.140> rotation<00:06:13.580> value

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
head rotation value

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.410 
head rotation value
kind<00:06:16.530> of<00:06:16.590> them<00:06:16.700> one<00:06:17.700> last<00:06:17.760> tool<00:06:18.060> we<00:06:18.180> want<00:06:18.300> to

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
kind of them one last tool we want to

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.490 
kind of them one last tool we want to
look<00:06:18.510> at<00:06:18.750> is<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:21.240> tool<00:06:21.510> that<00:06:21.540> allows<00:06:21.960> us<00:06:21.990> to

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
look at is the tool that allows us to

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.870 
look at is the tool that allows us to
show<00:06:24.290> where<00:06:25.290> we<00:06:25.530> have<00:06:25.740> pipes<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.340> cross<00:06:26.610> that

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
show where we have pipes that cross that

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.790 
show where we have pipes that cross that
don't<00:06:27.030> actually<00:06:27.210> connect<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.500> what<00:06:28.620> I'm<00:06:28.680> going

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
don't actually connect so what I'm going

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.180 
don't actually connect so what I'm going
to<00:06:28.860> do<00:06:28.980> is<00:06:29.220> just<00:06:29.430> select<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.850> height<00:06:30.570> and<00:06:31.470> may

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
to do is just select a height and may

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.270 
to do is just select a height and may
want<00:06:32.400> the<00:06:32.990> little<00:06:33.990> magnet<00:06:34.500> part<00:06:34.680> under<00:06:35.010> again

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
want the little magnet part under again

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.820 
want the little magnet part under again
so<00:06:35.520> you<00:06:35.660> can<00:06:36.660> see<00:06:36.720> exactly<00:06:37.020> what's<00:06:37.440> happening

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
so you can see exactly what's happening

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.560 
so you can see exactly what's happening
but<00:06:38.160> I'm<00:06:38.430> just<00:06:38.550> going<00:06:38.700> to<00:06:38.730> use<00:06:38.940> a<00:06:39.240> button<00:06:39.510> on

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
but I'm just going to use a button on

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.090 
but I'm just going to use a button on
the<00:06:39.630> tool<00:06:39.810> bar<00:06:39.990> it<00:06:40.080> says<00:06:40.110> create<00:06:40.500> jumps<00:06:40.920> on

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
the tool bar it says create jumps on

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.520 
the tool bar it says create jumps on
selected<00:06:41.520> lines<00:06:41.730> what<00:06:42.480> that<00:06:42.660> will<00:06:42.810> do<00:06:42.990> is<00:06:43.020> is

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
selected lines what that will do is is

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.740 
selected lines what that will do is is
find<00:06:43.920> that<00:06:44.100> intersecting<00:06:44.670> point<00:06:45.360> and<00:06:45.630> go

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
find that intersecting point and go

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.830 
find that intersecting point and go
ahead<00:06:45.930> and<00:06:46.170> create<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.880> pass<00:06:47.880> over<00:06:48.060> so<00:06:48.690> that<00:06:48.720> we

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
ahead and create a pass over so that we

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.810 
ahead and create a pass over so that we
can<00:06:49.050> tell<00:06:49.290> that<00:06:49.950> those<00:06:50.130> pipes<00:06:50.580> aren't

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
can tell that those pipes aren't

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.030 
can tell that those pipes aren't
actually<00:06:51.150> connected<00:06:51.180> name<00:06:51.950> sometimes<00:06:52.950> an

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
actually connected name sometimes an

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.470 
actually connected name sometimes an
idea<00:06:53.340> the<00:06:53.550> types<00:06:53.700> of<00:06:53.910> tools<00:06:54.120> that<00:06:54.210> would<00:06:54.390> be

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
idea the types of tools that would be

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.880 
idea the types of tools that would be
available<00:06:54.900> to<00:06:55.050> you<00:06:55.170> both<00:06:55.350> the<00:06:55.530> behind<00:06:55.800> the
