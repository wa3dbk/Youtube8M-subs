00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
situation to be in and it worked and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.870 
situation to be in and it worked and
last<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.569> not<00:02:19.720> least<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.260> goop<00:02:20.980> hitting

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
last but not least we have goop hitting

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
last but not least we have goop hitting
targets<00:02:22.329> with<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.510> chompers<00:02:22.989> ranged<00:02:23.380> goop

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
targets with the chompers ranged goop

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.970 
targets with the chompers ranged goop
attack<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> great<00:02:24.610> way<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.849> slow<00:02:25.299> them<00:02:25.510> down

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
attack is a great way to slow them down

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.740 
attack is a great way to slow them down
making<00:02:26.980> them<00:02:27.190> easier<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.700> chomp<00:02:28.060> they<00:02:28.450> taste

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
making them easier to chomp they taste

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.490 
making them easier to chomp they taste
better<00:02:29.049> -<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.660> final<00:02:31.900> time<00:02:32.200> I'm<00:02:32.410> going

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
better - now for a final time I'm going
