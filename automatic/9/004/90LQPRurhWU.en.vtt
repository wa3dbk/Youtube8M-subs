00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 so let's see, do not crash test 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:11.570
 on the helmet and if that's what you protect 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:17.310
 even the head picks up from a screen right 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:27.539
 involve a punch and two 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 can you bear a lot of pressure? 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:42.420
 God fucking god fucking broke 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:01:00.930
 a piece of it is very hard that absorbs 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:01:05.790
 the impact that the same of our 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:12.090
 hit him hard here 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.700
 He protects his head very well, you see. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.570
 Looks broke but it can protect the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 Head right? 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 Look here 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:51.160
 clinton swing helmet crÃ¨che 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:55.930
 At the time we wear a helmet. 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:04.660
 I have already passed, it protects the head very much . 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:06.250
 You're not there, the total protection took 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.729
 to destroy the helmet 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.959
 I'd be very fucking imagine if you 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.959
 have no helmet 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.570
 Thanks, guys, thanks for watching the video.
