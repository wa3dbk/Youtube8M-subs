00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.494
 There are not many games in gaming that allow us to perform professional robberies 

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:20.564
 As payday games give us. 

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:22.656
 Maybe we really had crime games in an open world 

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.684
 Like GTA, Mafia or Sleeping Dogs, 

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:27.624
 But in Payday we experience serious and dangerous robberies 

00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:30.484
 Whether it's a fairly fast police force as we commit a crime, 

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:34.804
 Or if it's even choosing an ineffective team to carry out a robbery that will make you get caught. 

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:47.637
 Payday 2 is developed by Overkill Software as a sequel game 

00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:50.629
 For sex a pilot version of the second game when Payday The Heist 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.532
 Was very much loved by the fans and we all wasted on him for hours and hours 

00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:58.852
 But everyone felt that the game was a kind of unsatisfactory demo for what should be Payday 2. 

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:08.310
 We get into the shoes of Wolf, Dallas, Hawkston, and Chinas, 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.030
 A bunch of thieves when the game does not tell us beyond that. 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.122
 The group is controlled by a higher entity during missions 

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:18.412
 Which guides the group about the entire process of robbery and updates them on what is happening around them. 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.919
 During the game you will perform about 15 types of robberies when some of them 

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:31.701
 Will spread over several days, increasing the number of missions in a certain robbery. 

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:35.030
 In addition, most of the cheats shown to you will increase the level 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.939
 And so the robbery map will add more safes to rob, a different location for security 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.269
 Which makes it difficult for you to enter it and also the police, which arrive more quickly and in large numbers. 

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.611
 When you feel that you are really successful in the game and that everything is going to you easily 

00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.914
 You can also perform special and professional tasks when you have to 

00:01:56.914 --> 00:02:00.853
 Be quietest and slowest you can because if you make the smallest mistake 

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:04.983
 And take note of you, you will not have much chance against the police forces or SWAT. 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.995
 Of course the game allows you to play with three more friends 

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:18.280
 And perform together in a synchronized manner the robbers seamlessly, 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.326
 Or you can decide to kill your way to money and wealth. 

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:23.930
 But if you do not play with friends you may have a hard time 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.773
 Get along with a bunch whose minds are different from yours 

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:29.803
 Or you'll have to do the robbery with a bunch of amateurs who do not fit your league. 

00:02:36.618 --> 00:02:39.394
 The game also brings you a simple and easy to understand skill system. 

00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:41.813
 Each band of bandits has its own class. 

00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:45.010
 The classics are Mastermind, Enforcer, Technition, and Ghost. 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.071
 Each class is unique and gives about 20 Perks, which you can unlock while you are rising levels. 

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.696
 All chapters you develop will help you during the robberies 

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:53.494
 As a faster run with money on you, 

00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:56.824
 Receive a monetary bonus at the end of each task or even new equipment. 

00:03:02.903 --> 00:03:05.977
 The playfulness that is presented to us during the robberies also succeeds in renewing 

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.556
 When you have the option of deciding whether to behave in peace 

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:11.489
 And carry out the robbery under the guards' nose and security cameras 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.346
 Or you can shoot and do everything as fast as you can 

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:17.246
 But I've been saying it's easy to get into but it's hard to get out. 

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:27.152
 During the course of my game I was plagued by one very big thing, 

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:29.832
 It is very difficult to play alone in a game with bots. 

00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:32.785
 The AI â€‹â€‹of the group is destroyed when you are not playing if no one 

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.740
 Because the other bandits will not answer your orders most of the time 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.493
 Or let you deal with all the cops arriving on the scene. 

00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:40.696
 You can see that the game is built only for the multi-player mode 

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:44.876
 And it's a shame that he called OFFLINE in the game because he does not need it. 

00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:56.249
 By the way, as another way of giving more attention to the game 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.555
 A small network series was filmed showing you a bank robbery of the gang and beyond that. 

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.556
 To view the series press the button at the bottom. 

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:05.907
 And if all this is not convincing enough to buy the game, 

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:10.337
 The development company announced five extensions that will soon be added to the game, which will deepen the experience. 

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:19.417
 If you choose to play Payday 2 then you are guaranteed an amazing and enjoyable experience 

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:22.764
 When you are happy to play with your friends and rob banks or galleries 

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:25.636
 But my recommendation will try to avoid playing on your own 

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:30.246
 Because if you decide to play like that then you will find yourself completely alone without any support. 

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.689
 So this is the coverage on Payday 2. 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.458

 This is also the place to tell you about a new podcast where my two friends talk every week about various gaming topics. 

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:54.640
 I would be happy if you would check and give an opinion. 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.086
