00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
together I have no idea you know it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.710 
together I have no idea you know it
really<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.610> matter<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.760> these<00:01:10.970> guys<00:01:11.240> wanting

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
really is a matter of these guys wanting

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.120 
really is a matter of these guys wanting
to<00:01:11.780> come<00:01:11.960> together<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.409> work<00:01:12.530> together<00:01:12.770> and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
to come together and work together and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.789 
to come together and work together and
that's<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.400> way<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.700> basketball<00:01:14.680> what<00:01:15.680> we

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
that's the way it is basketball what we

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.280 
that's the way it is basketball what we
thought<00:01:16.210> when<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.270> went<00:01:17.570> on<00:01:17.689> is<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.020> find

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
thought when we went on is to find

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.200 
thought when we went on is to find
character<00:01:18.979> guys<00:01:21.549> guys<00:01:22.549> are<00:01:22.760> one<00:01:22.939> play

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
character guys guys are one play

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.670 
character guys guys are one play
together<00:01:23.979> doesn't<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.280> kind<00:01:25.490> of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
together doesn't have that kind of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.300 
together doesn't have that kind of
characteristic<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.710> goes<00:01:28.010> along<00:01:28.189> with

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
characteristic that goes along with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.370 
characteristic that goes along with
their<00:01:28.640> game<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.630> think<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.869> got<00:01:29.899> some<00:01:30.229> guys

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
their game and I think we got some guys

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.999 
their game and I think we got some guys
that<00:01:30.409> will<00:01:30.710> do<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:31.210> surprising<00:01:32.210> all<00:01:33.009> didn't

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
that will do that surprising all didn't

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
forward spot of the wing spot as it can

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.730

swing<00:03:02.120> back<00:03:02.330> between<00:03:02.570> three<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.110> four<00:03:03.500> have

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
swing back between three and four have

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.250 
swing back between three and four have
the<00:03:03.860> speed<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.160> cover<00:03:04.630> don't<00:03:05.630> do<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.840> kind<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
the speed to cover don't do that kind of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.120 
the speed to cover don't do that kind of
thing<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:08.180> know<00:03:08.240> I<00:03:08.300> think<00:03:08.420> his<00:03:08.860> scoring<00:03:09.860> is

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
thing you know I think his scoring is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.800 
thing you know I think his scoring is
still<00:03:10.400> that'll<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.700> very<00:03:10.730> important<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.510> us

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
still that'll be very important for us

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.380 
still that'll be very important for us
but<00:03:12.050> we<00:03:12.980> really<00:03:13.280> said<00:03:13.730> we<00:03:13.940> want<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.240> play

but we really said we want to play
defense<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.350> what<00:03:15.530> we're

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
defense and this is what we're

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.550 
defense and this is what we're

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.220 
like to have a backup center you know
Cole<00:04:12.860> opted<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.700> go<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.940> Los<00:04:14.390> Angeles<00:04:14.840> Clippers

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
Cole opted to go to Los Angeles Clippers

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.590 
Cole opted to go to Los Angeles Clippers
and<00:04:15.440> we<00:04:15.500> understand<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.100> those<00:04:16.520> you<00:04:17.450> know<00:04:17.540> a

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
and we understand that those you know a

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.830 
and we understand that those you know a
choice<00:04:17.840> but<00:04:18.169> we<00:04:18.290> did<00:04:18.470> extend<00:04:18.890> an<00:04:19.010> offer<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.489> him

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
choice but we did extend an offer to him

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.930 
choice but we did extend an offer to him
so<00:04:20.840> we'll<00:04:21.020> probably<00:04:21.310> look<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.520> have<00:04:22.669> another

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
so we'll probably look to have another
