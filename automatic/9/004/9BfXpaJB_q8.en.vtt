00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.480
 well geminis here I see you like in a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.250
 moment in a period with an energy of 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 organization to specify matters 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.180
 I also see what 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.289
 like you see that you have to reflect 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.900
 all this energy that is coming 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.520
 now at this time for you order 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.440
 of organizations like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.950
 to dig a little deeper into that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.400
 organization and putting things really 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.570
 what works and what helps us 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.890
 put it in order 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.489
 this is what I see there is here is how 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:56.090
 really look at that organization that 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.340
 has right now with that discipline that 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.079
 he also has right now is also 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.720
 in that discipline, the 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.290
 observation contemplation inside 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.390
 There was then inside as I always say 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.009
 in where are all the answers 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.050
 because here I can help a little 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.720
 but really where are all the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.210
 accurate answers is totally 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.490
 inside in your own heart and if 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.240
 ask if it goes in you like it I say that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 the answer is clear 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.700
 absolute good what is in your favor 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.420
 here is like that organization that you're 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.420
 having now 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.960
 also count on others for this 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.800
 organization that has because also 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.740
 it has to do or 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.370
 or to get collaboration or from you 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.690
 collaborate because he writes or that that is 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.290
 in your favor 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.270
 I may ask for help or you see it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.790
 that's what's in your favor but 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.770
 always with that one with that line that you're 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.370
 having now to organize the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.430
 discipline discipline to concretize 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.740
 things that what is coming for you and is 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.710
 your favor 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.880
 in regard to the advice they give 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.880
 here is how 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.430
 what it says experience enjoys it has the 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.709
 a child's heart feels life is not 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.469
 what he is telling me he learns from what 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 new that comes in your life but always 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:36.760
 remembering to go inside 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.969
 and be a little cautious and study what 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.970
 you want to do how to structure how well 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:45.340
 to be able to remove it 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 so is the advice here really 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.620
 as 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.110
 experience give yourself the opportunity to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.050
 experience as a child 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.590
 to enjoy like a child without doing 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.810
 judgments because really when you're very 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.890
 small when 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.500
 we are very small we do not make judgments 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.350
 none then a little bit of this 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 way but always being prudent and 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.550
 structuring or structuring 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.620
 studying deeply what what 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:25.220
 is organizing right now not to observe 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:29.090
 really that is the best not here 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.220
 says you also see the opportunities 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.440
 that they are going to offer you their life 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.440
 because here I see that opportunities come 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.900
 and wash them that take it 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.850
 intelligent that is observant and that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.440
 take advantage of the opportunities that are going 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:49.160
 to come soon it's worth it that you do not lose 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.540
 the hopes also tells me 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.280
 on the advice of 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.280
 and well here he says 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.299
 what 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.299
 what 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.170
 learn to accept if in the past 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.840
 if in the past they gave you advice and 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.940
 it worked for you so I applied it again 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.740
 and that what the synthesis does not have if 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.229
 they have given you a council and it has served you 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.930
 in the past then you apply it 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.000
 again because this from this of this 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.780
 it is worth 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.780
 and good 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.660
