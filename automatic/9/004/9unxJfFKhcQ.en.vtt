00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 chloÃ© you'd like to have some 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.980
 dolomite in your garden and you already have it 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.279
 well prepared really you did good 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.990
 job 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.519
 what is important when one is time 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.480
 of dolomite to do it on a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.980
 sufficient thickness 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 it is also important to plan a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.219
 veil in your roots veil prevents 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.960
 actually weeds to grow 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.460
 through dolomite so you have to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 place this veil anti roots for 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.980
 extend the dolomite over then one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.930
 go 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 you can continue to unroll and andÃ© 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 correctly the veil anti root on the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 soil the veil anti roots prevents the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.950
 weeds to push through 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.510
 dolomite ok we can possibly 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.559
 fix it with a pin so 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.910
 that they do not move when we 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.230
 will extend the dolomite otherwise it will move 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.670
 without stopping low fixed the corners of the veil 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.670
 anti roots using pins 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 when you put the next one you have to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.770
 ensure overlap 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 correct about this distance about like 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.100
 that way over and now we can 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.100
 re fixed and this using this pin 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.430
 here is the veil anti root is in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.430
 place now we can expand 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.119
 now we're going to transfer that from 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.009
 this side is easy to start with 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.590
 divide the dolomite above the veil 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.600
 anti roots then using a rake 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.190
 makes sure that dolomite is 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 evenly spread all over the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.340
 area 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.049
 loris you can rake in this 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.090
 direction then in this one it will be 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.350
 perfect indeed if you miss is always 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.649
 in the same direction you will get some 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.270
 lines 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.770
 so you have to cross a little 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.770
 to obtain a nice uniform distribution 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.530
 so what do you think 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.880
 it's pretty flat no yes if it was for 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.899
 a car it will still have raked a 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.140
 little in order to get a result 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.459
 perfectly smooth for a garden this 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.459
 enough like that yes
