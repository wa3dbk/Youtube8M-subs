00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.199 
respect to those so that's what we're
doing<00:03:01.110> right<00:03:01.140> now<00:03:01.640> up<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:02.970> spacecraft

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
doing right now up on the spacecraft

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.750 
doing right now up on the spacecraft
they're<00:03:04.050> getting<00:03:04.440> new<00:03:04.650> horizons<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.490> beam

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
they're getting new horizons to beam

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
they're getting new horizons to beam
back<00:03:06.060> pictures<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.720> Pluto<00:03:06.990> against<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
back pictures of Pluto against the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.729 
back pictures of Pluto against the
surrounding<00:03:08.640> stars<00:03:09.060> which<00:03:09.810> they<00:03:10.020> use<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
surrounding stars which they use to

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.729 
surrounding stars which they use to
build<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.280> roadmap<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:12.090> space<00:03:12.570> just<00:03:13.440> like<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
build a roadmap in space just like the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.440 
build a roadmap in space just like the
old<00:03:13.860> sailors<00:03:14.310> did<00:03:14.520> back<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.940> day<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
old sailors did back in the day that the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
old sailors did back in the day that the
sextant<00:03:15.900> they<00:03:16.050> knew<00:03:16.230> where<00:03:16.590> certain<00:03:17.100> stars

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
sextant they knew where certain stars

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
sextant they knew where certain stars
were<00:03:17.580> at<00:03:17.880> certain<00:03:18.480> times<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.050> day

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
were at certain times of the day

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.170 
were at certain times of the day
therefore<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:20.160> knew<00:03:20.340> where<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:20.580> were<00:03:20.790> on

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
therefore they knew where they were on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.900 
therefore they knew where they were on
the<00:03:21.480> planet<00:03:21.900> where<00:03:22.709> Pluto<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.430> with<00:03:23.670> respect

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the planet where Pluto is with respect

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.060 
the planet where Pluto is with respect
to<00:03:24.270> those<00:03:24.450> stars<00:03:24.900> we're<00:03:25.380> able<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.739> determine

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
to those stars we're able to determine

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.949 
to those stars we're able to determine
where<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.670> spacecraft<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.330> with<00:03:27.510> respect<00:03:27.660> to

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
where the spacecraft is with respect to

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.119 
where the spacecraft is with respect to
Pluto

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
Pluto

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.979 
Pluto
we're<00:03:30.670> getting<00:03:30.939> there<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.390> know<00:03:31.480> almost<00:03:31.749> a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
we're getting there you know almost a

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.709 
we're getting there you know almost a
million<00:03:32.290> miles<00:03:32.469> a<00:03:32.650> day<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.400> we're<00:03:34.389> coming<00:03:34.569> up

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 
million miles a day so we're coming up

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.560 
million miles a day so we're coming up
on<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> planet<00:03:35.319> fast
