00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.820
 many of us TV chefs are even more exclusive in 35 minutes and less 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.810
 that one more 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 ready to go to the pots 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.019
 Emperor of course we had certain advantages of course Master had to be natural 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.929
 cook because two things 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:21.839
 but 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.639
 At the finale there you have to cook inside another recipe, although today 

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:30.409
 someone after my two courses that is the following something in the 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:31.479
 starter 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.479
 Inlet carpaccio with fried Corp an 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.960
 because early in the first quarter episode of accidents keep premature 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.149
 our imagine 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.479
 So, of course, very early in the year he appeared to us that it 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.120
 to stay foreign policy 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.540
 It is very important and we wanted to do it 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.510
 this Latina or in between so the "time thicker 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.010
 Vienna and Katharina leaves a marginalia on top or paprika 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.580
 with lime on the unfamiliar juice of course with some salt and LÃ¼beck 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.060
 rounded with olive oil and in this deep fried carbon so 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.620
 INDUKOM different 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.750
 So there is already today he wants nothing of it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230
 yes but if you dry those cards well 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.030
 Dub's and other street is 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 there are those who fillet again their flower or if he really nice 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.250
 crispy in the Berlin and Rusty Kaliss was their correct numbers just because of that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 Two were drowned 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.890
 at the main course 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.860
 the silence of the lambs and that 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.720
 a lame Euros new skewer with mushrooms fried and orange 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 potatoes 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.790
 Field are euro represents that is in itself a very coherent 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.890
 combination 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.700
 and the odds then with an ass spiced up my garden of course 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 Grab orange juice with euro 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.920
 To this end, quite importantly, some garlic measures gravel and grit 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.210
 But he has to know except LÃ¼ck Schmadtke - that's the way it has to be 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 London - introducing her 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.550
 if you look at that crisis slam find that is so tender and fine and 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.170
 laity 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.379
 the kids have eyes soared the numbers
