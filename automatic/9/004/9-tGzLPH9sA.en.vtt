college<00:00:02.190> it<00:00:02.370> commentary<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.780> at<00:00:03.959> college

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
college it commentary we're at college

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.130 
college it commentary we're at college
it<00:00:04.380> was<00:00:04.650> Newtown<00:00:05.040> 24-7<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.120> i<00:00:06.420> went<00:00:06.839> about<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
it was Newtown 24-7 so i went about a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.810 
it was Newtown 24-7 so i went about a
lot<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.830> suppose<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.429> one<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
lot and I suppose this is one of the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.140 
lot and I suppose this is one of the
best<00:00:08.970> game<00:00:09.420> player<00:00:09.660> got<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.429> good

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
best game player got it's not that good

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.789 
best game player got it's not that good
in<00:00:12.179> ratio<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.679> quite

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
in ratio but I think it's quite

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.460 
in ratio but I think it's quite
interesting<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.910> using<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:15.900> night<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
interesting and using this night but I

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.400 
interesting and using this night but I
think<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.890> like<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.449> different<00:00:18.900> element

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
think it like that's a different element

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.189 
think it like that's a different element
to<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.060> other<00:00:21.060> than<00:00:21.210> way<00:00:21.420> even<00:00:21.869> said<00:00:22.080> well

element<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.770> afoot<00:01:58.920> makes<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.790> much

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
element of the game afoot makes it much

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.679 
element of the game afoot makes it much
more<00:02:00.210> fun<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:01.430> anyone<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.670> play<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.240> speed

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
team like 12 in it and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.700 
team like 12 in it and
cross<00:02:07.340> goal<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:08.090> speed<00:02:08.660> whatever<00:02:09.320> whatever

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
bit bar and think doing skill it just

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.990 
bit bar and think doing skill it just
from<00:02:15.020> each<00:02:15.200> makes<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.740> much<00:02:16.100> more<00:02:16.340> fun<00:02:16.640> and
