in<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.450> rhythm<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> staggered<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
in a rhythm that's kind of staggered it

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
in a rhythm that's kind of staggered it
kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> sounds<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:39.350> if<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.620> hear

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
kind of sounds like this if you can hear

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.840 
kind of sounds like this if you can hear
that<00:00:40.890> did<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:43.850> that's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that did it get it put it with it that's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.410 
that did it get it put it with it that's
good<00:00:45.829> for<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.430> lot<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> games<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> stuff<00:00:48.300> like

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
good for a lot of games and stuff like

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
good for a lot of games and stuff like
that<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:50.510> street<00:00:51.510> fighter<00:00:51.719> 4<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.320> you're

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that but in street fighter 4 when you're

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.340 
that but in street fighter 4 when you're
trying<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> e<00:00:52.920> x<00:00:53.250> legs<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
trying to get the e x legs out if you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.750 
trying to get the e x legs out if you
look<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.510> rhythm<00:00:58.760> 1

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
look here if you do it to that rhythm 1

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
look here if you do it to that rhythm 1
2<00:00:59.879> 3<00:00:59.910> 4<00:01:00.210> 5<00:01:00.800> you'll<00:01:01.800> notice<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:03.629> VX<00:01:04.229> legs

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
2 3 4 5 you'll notice that the VX legs

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.060 
2 3 4 5 you'll notice that the VX legs
doesn't<00:01:04.979> always<00:01:05.309> come<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:07.740> comes<00:01:07.950> out

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
doesn't always come out it comes out

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.140 
doesn't always come out it comes out
sometimes<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.689> left<00:01:11.150> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
sometimes but it's a little left it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.859 
sometimes but it's a little left it's
inconsistent<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> reason<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.939> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
inconsistent and the reason for that is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.140 
inconsistent and the reason for that is
because<00:01:16.020> there's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> gap<00:01:16.950> between<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.700> first

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
because there's a gap between the first

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
because there's a gap between the first
forward<00:01:18.960> kick<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.770> second<00:01:20.130> short<00:01:20.400> time

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
forward kick and the second short time

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.220 
forward kick and the second short time
you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> hear<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
you can hear that

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.640 
you can hear that
that<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.220> gap<00:01:23.810> between<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.230> second<00:01:25.620> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that little gap between the second and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.640 
that little gap between the second and
third<00:01:25.830> kicks<00:01:26.340> overall<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> doing

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
third kicks overall what that is doing

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.250 
third kicks overall what that is doing
its<00:01:29.010> staggering<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.790> timing<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.990> X<00:01:31.140> next

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
its staggering the timing of the X next

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.440 
its staggering the timing of the X next
to<00:01:31.620> come<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.580> it's<00:01:32.730> not<00:01:32.850> counting<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.420> as

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to come out so it's not counting it as

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.880 
to come out so it's not counting it as
five<00:01:33.900> total<00:01:34.320> inputs<00:01:36.290> another<00:01:37.290> reason<00:01:37.500> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
five total inputs another reason is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
five total inputs another reason is
because<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.030> bx<00:01:39.930> legs<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.950> only<00:01:41.160> cancel<00:01:41.670> as

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
because the bx legs will only cancel as

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.290 
because the bx legs will only cancel as
soon<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.440> chun<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.250> bringing<00:01:44.640> her<00:01:44.760> leg<00:01:44.940> back<00:01:45.120> if

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
soon as chun is bringing her leg back if

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.380 
soon as chun is bringing her leg back if
you<00:01:45.420> saw<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.890> as<00:01:46.890> soon<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.580> lift<00:01:47.760> her<00:01:47.970> leg

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you saw them as soon as the lift her leg

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230 
you saw them as soon as the lift her leg
is<00:01:48.870> starting<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.740> pull<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.970> when<00:01:51.210> we

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
is starting to pull back that is when we

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.980 
is starting to pull back that is when we
can<00:01:51.510> cancel<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.960> VX<00:01:52.260> way<00:01:53.330> i<00:01:54.330> found<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.870> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
can cancel the VX way i found that a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
can cancel the VX way i found that a
better<00:01:55.170> way<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.440> do<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.160> just<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.850> sure

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
better way to do it is to just make sure

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.600 
better way to do it is to just make sure
that<00:01:57.870> you<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> steady<00:01:58.590> constant<00:01:59.040> rhythm

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that you have a steady constant rhythm

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
that you have a steady constant rhythm
when<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:00.570> doing<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.730> by<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:03.740> sure<00:02:04.740> he'll

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
when you're doing it by that sure he'll

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.480 
when you're doing it by that sure he'll
be<00:02:05.040> over<00:02:05.160> here<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.730> you<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
be over here this but you just do it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.400 
be over here this but you just do it
like<00:02:08.490> one<00:02:08.880> two<00:02:09.060> three<00:02:09.240> four<00:02:09.420> five<00:02:09.450> it'll<00:02:10.200> come

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
like one two three four five it'll come

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.070 
like one two three four five it'll come
out<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.950> hundred<00:02:11.280> percent<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.080> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
out like a hundred percent of you you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.360 
out like a hundred percent of you you
just<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.410> make<00:02:13.590> sure<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.130> rhythm

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
just have to make sure that the rhythm

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
just have to make sure that the rhythm
is<00:02:14.460> study<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:14.970> once<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.390> three<00:02:15.540> profile<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
is study so once you three profile you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
is study so once you three profile you
can<00:02:16.710> use<00:02:16.890> any<00:02:17.160> combination<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.970> kicks<00:02:18.240> one<00:02:18.450> two

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
can use any combination of kicks one two

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.500 
can use any combination of kicks one two

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
lot more reliable than trying to do a
