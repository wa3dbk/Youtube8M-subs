00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
photoshop something like this it's a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
little bit of editing when it comes to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
little bit of editing when it comes to
like<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> shadow<00:01:05.040> work<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:06.330> course<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:07.020> could

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
like a shadow work of course it could

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
like a shadow work of course it could
all<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.650> myths<00:01:07.979> who<00:01:08.250> knows<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:09.360> let's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
all just be myths who knows now let's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.789 
all just be myths who knows now let's
look<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> next<00:01:10.170> picture<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.619> next

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
look at the next picture the next

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.740 
look at the next picture the next
picture<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.159> by<00:01:11.490> far<00:01:11.790> probably<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> worst<00:01:12.420> one

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
picture is by far probably the worst one

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
picture is by far probably the worst one
and<00:01:12.930> honestly<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and honestly I think this is this is the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
and honestly I think this is this is the
picture<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> flat-out<00:01:15.840> proves<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.439> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
picture that flat-out proves that this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.539 
picture that flat-out proves that this
is<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:17.009> fake<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.640> every<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.600> possible

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
is just fake in every way possible

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.950 
is just fake in every way possible
basically<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
basically you can see what there's a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
basically you can see what there's a
classic<00:01:22.320> mode<00:01:22.710> boss<00:01:23.220> mode<00:01:23.580> special<00:01:24.270> orders

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
etc etc etc now what really throws this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.530 
etc etc etc now what really throws this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.609 
any sense like yes I can see Ridley I
can<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> yellow<00:01:48.659> devil<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.500> the

can see the yellow devil I can see the
master<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.450> sure<00:01:51.450> whatever<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.740> just

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
master for sure whatever but it just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
master for sure whatever but it just
doesn't<00:01:53.220> look<00:01:53.369> convincing<00:01:54.000> whatsoever<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
doesn't look convincing whatsoever and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.469 
doesn't look convincing whatsoever and
then<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> look<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> top<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:57.090> here

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
then if you look at the top right here

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
then if you look at the top right here
why<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.680> tiny<00:01:59.159> arc<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.820> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
why is this little tiny arc there I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.330 
why is this little tiny arc there I
understand<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
understand that like you know that it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
understand that like you know that it
might<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.880> special<00:02:03.689> thing<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
might just be a special thing like on

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.230 
might just be a special thing like on
the<00:02:04.200> bottom<00:02:04.500> there's<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.740> arc<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.969> why<00:02:06.180> is

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the bottom there's an arc too but why is

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.089

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
this is just what basically prove that

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.820 
this is just what basically prove that
this<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.330> completely<00:02:13.930> fake<00:02:14.230> right<00:02:14.440> here<00:02:14.650> this

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
character that basically beats the boss

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.170 
character that basically beats the boss
now<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:14.040> question<00:03:15.040> what's<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.670> point<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.090> this

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
now I question what's the point of this

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.810 
now I question what's the point of this
mode<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.840> true<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.440> what<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.640> it

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
mode if it's true like what like it

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.070 
mode if it's true like what like it
doesn't<00:03:19.180> really<00:03:19.300> look<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.690> you'd<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.989> able

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
doesn't really look like you'd be able

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.690 
doesn't really look like you'd be able
to<00:03:20.230> do<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.440> an<00:03:20.620> eight<00:03:20.739> players<00:03:21.040> smash<00:03:21.400> with

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
to do like an eight players smash with

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270 
to do like an eight players smash with
the<00:03:21.820> bosses<00:03:22.209> or<00:03:22.330> anything<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:23.070> what's<00:03:24.070> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
the bosses or anything so what's the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.800 
the bosses or anything so what's the
point<00:03:24.520> of<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.360> doesn't<00:03:25.690> really

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
point of it it just it doesn't really

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.010 
point of it it just it doesn't really
look<00:03:26.020> like<00:03:26.080> anything<00:03:26.590> like<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.100> crazy<00:03:27.520> and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
look like anything like that crazy and

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.420 
look like anything like that crazy and
it's<00:03:29.020> just<00:03:29.260> I'd<00:03:29.410> find<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> little<00:03:30.040> almost

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
it's just I'd find it a little almost

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.830 
it's just I'd find it a little almost
pointless<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.239> why<00:03:31.450> would<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.720> even

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
pointless to like why would you even

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120 
pointless to like why would you even
bother<00:03:32.020> adding<00:03:32.410> this<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.770> game<00:03:32.950> when<00:03:33.100> it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
bother adding this to the game when it

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.590 
bother adding this to the game when it
hasn't<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.520> nothing<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> do<00:03:34.120> with<00:03:34.239> anything

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
hasn't like nothing to do with anything

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.449 
hasn't like nothing to do with anything
and<00:03:34.750> then<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.830> see<00:03:36.010> this<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.340> icon

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
and then we can see this little icon

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.570 
and then we can see this little icon
right<00:03:36.730> here<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.209> boss<00:03:37.450> icon<00:03:37.989> for<00:03:38.620> one<00:03:38.830> why

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
right here is the boss icon for one why

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.370 
right here is the boss icon for one why
are<00:03:39.610> they<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.060> showing<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:40.959> then

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
are they not showing this and then

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.890 
are they not showing this and then
you're<00:03:41.950> also<00:03:42.130> showing<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:43.060> boss<00:03:43.300> menu<00:03:43.750> with

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
you're also showing the boss menu with

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.440 
you're also showing the boss menu with
the<00:03:43.959> one<00:03:44.080> with<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.320> actual<00:03:44.709> characters<00:03:45.450> it

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the one with the actual characters it

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.790 
the one with the actual characters it
just<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.840> really<00:03:46.870> doesn't<00:03:47.350> make<00:03:47.410> any<00:03:47.590> sense

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
just it really doesn't make any sense

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.250 
just it really doesn't make any sense
and<00:03:48.070> then<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.459> top<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.360> icon<00:03:50.020> is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
and then on top of that this icon is

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.590 
and then on top of that this icon is
actually<00:03:50.500> found<00:03:50.920> on<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.190> 3ds<00:03:51.550> version<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.360> if

in between the boss and the random it's

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.100 
in between the boss and the random it's
just<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.180> doesn't<00:04:13.570> convince<00:04:13.959> me
