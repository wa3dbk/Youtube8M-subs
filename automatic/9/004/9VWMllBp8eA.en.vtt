00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
material it it it's it in the old days

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820 
material it it it's it in the old days
when<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.539> made<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> was<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.170> flat

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
when they first made it was just flat

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.759 
when they first made it was just flat
smooth<00:00:20.250> aluminum<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.320> kind<00:00:22.710> of

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
smooth aluminum and it and kind of

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.150 
smooth aluminum and it and kind of
looked<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.400> bit<00:00:24.470> prefab<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.980> will

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
looked a little bit prefab if you will

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.630 
looked a little bit prefab if you will
but<00:00:26.910> they've<00:00:27.500> recently<00:00:28.500> given<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> little

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
but they've recently given it a little

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
but they've recently given it a little
texture<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.210> wood<00:00:30.480> grain<00:00:30.720> look<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
texture a little wood grain look to it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
texture a little wood grain look to it
so<00:00:31.740> which<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.090> probably<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
so which I think was probably as a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
so which I think was probably as a
result<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.440> pressure<00:00:34.710> from<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> vinyl<00:00:35.489> siding

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
result of pressure from the vinyl siding

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
result of pressure from the vinyl siding
business<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.079> had<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.649> ability

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
business as they had a lot more ability

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.580 
business as they had a lot more ability
to<00:00:38.399> mimic<00:00:38.760> wood<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.690> came<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.890> PVC

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
to mimic wood when they came up with PVC

to mimic wood when they came up with PVC
sometimes<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.370> replace<00:00:44.640> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.469 
don't have to do the entire house but
some<00:01:31.950> people<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.670> look<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> aluminum

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
some people like the look of aluminum

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.620 
some people like the look of aluminum
siding<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:34.380> people<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.710> look<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.790> vinyl

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
siding some people like look of a vinyl

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
siding some people like look of a vinyl
siding<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.229> PVC<00:01:37.530> siding<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.450> just

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
siding or PVC siding so it's really just

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.359 
siding or PVC siding so it's really just
a<00:01:39.750> matter<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.079> knowing<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.920> different

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
a matter of knowing what the different

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
a matter of knowing what the different
materials<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.780> react<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.560> how

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
materials do and how they react and how

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.550 
materials do and how they react and how
they<00:01:43.950> interact<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.390> do

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
they interact with what you want to do

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.569 
they interact with what you want to do
that's<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> determine<00:01:46.920> whether<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.490> not

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that's going to determine whether or not

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
that's going to determine whether or not
you're<00:01:47.880> gonna<00:01:48.000> want<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.390> maybe<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you're gonna want it maybe you just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
you're gonna want it maybe you just
bought<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> house<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:49.979> got<00:01:50.490> aluminum

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
bought a house and it's got aluminum

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
bought a house and it's got aluminum
siding<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
siding and you don't want it on there so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
siding and you don't want it on there so
you<00:01:53.220> take<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> down<00:01:53.790> put<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.360> would
