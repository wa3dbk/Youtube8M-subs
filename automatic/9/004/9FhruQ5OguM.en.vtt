00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 in our service there is a part 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.539

 early intervention is important 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.930
 very important also because this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.519

 school at the outpatient clinic

 psychotherapy specialists 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.989
 call parents to psychotherapy 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.370
 family group psychotherapy up 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.049
 to arrive at moments in which they have 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.950
 need to be hospitalized but not in 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.000
 Hospital 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.100
 we try to avoid hospitalizations 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.930
 in the hospital and we put them in one 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.359
 protected temporary residence that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.650
 inside a normal building in a 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.359
 flat 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 a service this however for the protection 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.700
 of the mental health of the adolescent 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.160
 which, however, risks being reduced 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.720
 even to disappear 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.470
 unfortunately yes even though we are the only one 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.720
 we have 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.210
 the risk of reducing the deficit 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.790
 of health cut these services 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.250
 because they probably could be 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560
 interpreted as something extra e 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.450
 instead they are fundamental fundamentals 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.650
