00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 there is a micro 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.680
 SIM card 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.770
 Most cards are normal 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.430
 mini are so like this then here now 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.700
 Of course, here they do not fit 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700
 in 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.869
 You can download yourself on the internet 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.899
 the instructions how to get out of a normal 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.340
 sim card using scissors one 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.890
 you can cut yourself micro-sim-card 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 you have to print out and print 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 then if you cut it out like that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.850
 a small city can live here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.730
 you forking out on the mini sim card 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.079
 and can then scissors with which the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 correspondingly small cut outside 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.430
 is a plastic because a chip is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.759
 actually down this little one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.759
 Cover then you have to tap beforehand 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.810
 with it also holds well 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.810
 when cutting 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.600
 one time and again 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.330
 it is then stuck so the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 knew here has to know with this the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:51.820
 consistency and then the whole 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.670
 cut relatively generously 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.150
 especially the expression a bit smaller 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.150
 was when 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:11.140
 the real microsim can cut off 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.890
 you still have a piece of it sticking to it 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.890
 a little bit harder 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:27.010
 a near miss, it looks really only 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.010
 plastic departed 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.910
 behind it as it goes on adhesive tape 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.430
 even from that you can then throw away 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.940
 Let's see if it fits probably 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.120
 does not fit is a bit too 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.120
 large 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.000
 but as I said sections stop 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.000
 still 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.140
 Now you can that here 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.910
 adapt a little bit to see if that from 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:10.830
 The length fits very close when you 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.260
 in front a little bit off and so on 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.250
 much of what ZusammenarbeitjÃ¤hrigen of course terminated . obliged 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.250
 possibly no contact 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:27.230
 that's good, here it must be 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.970
 only fit in the broad because the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.970
 Contacts are actually relatively large 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.510
 pow 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.080
 that fits well corners must be rounded 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.080
 become 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.190
 and here it is very good 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.280
 wrong around 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.270
 pow 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.680
 That's what it was from that very day 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.979
 would like to see all the settings 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.979
 knowledge
