a<00:00:34.590> Wacom<00:00:35.219> tablet<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.880> book<00:00:36.390> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
a Wacom tablet in your book you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
a Wacom tablet in your book you
mentioned<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> six<00:00:37.290> by<00:00:37.440> 11<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.370> preferred

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
mentioned a six by 11 as your preferred
size<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.809> wondering<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.320> size<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
size I was wondering if that size is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
size I was wondering if that size is
ever<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.579> bit<00:00:41.760> too<00:00:41.879> small<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> why<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
ever a bit too small for you and why you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.260 
ever a bit too small for you and why you
ended<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.280> size<00:00:44.489> I've<00:00:45.090> always

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
ended up with that size I've always

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.840 
ended up with that size I've always
gravitated<00:00:45.809> towards<00:00:46.440> drawing<00:00:46.920> smaller<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
gravitated towards drawing smaller so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
gravitated towards drawing smaller so
that<00:00:47.879> small<00:00:48.329> movements<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.140> hand<00:00:49.469> would

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that small movements with my hand would

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
that small movements with my hand would
pay<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.070> big<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.030> screen<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.230> old

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
pay off big on the screen this is my old

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.790 
pay off big on the screen this is my old
wacom<00:00:52.800> tablet<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.969> used<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
wacom tablet and I used to have it I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
wacom tablet and I used to have it I
used<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> mapping<00:00:56.910> set<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.660> be

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
used to have the mapping set down to be

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.349 
used to have the mapping set down to be
this<00:00:57.960> size<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.489> drew<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.940> such<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> small

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this size and I drew in such a small

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.869 
this size and I drew in such a small
spot<00:01:00.719> actually<00:01:01.109> wore<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> whole<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.280> finish<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
spot actually wore a whole the finish of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.870 
spot actually wore a whole the finish of
the<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.719> covering<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:05.010> fact<00:01:05.339> since<00:01:05.729> I've

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the the covering here in fact since I've

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.660 
the the covering here in fact since I've
written<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.299> book<00:01:06.330> I've<00:01:06.780> gone<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.010> using<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
written that book I've gone with using a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
written that book I've gone with using a
bamboo<00:01:09.630> which<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> quite<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> bit

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
bamboo which you can see is quite a bit

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.670 
bamboo which you can see is quite a bit
smaller<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> takes<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:12.600> less

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
smaller but it takes up a lot less

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.820 
smaller but it takes up a lot less
surface<00:01:13.680> space<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.180> allows<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:16.409> my

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
surface space so it it allows for my my

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
surface space so it it allows for my my
arms<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> fall<00:01:17.430> more<00:01:17.700> naturally<00:01:18.240> where<00:01:18.659> I'm

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
arms to fall more naturally where I'm

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.330 
arms to fall more naturally where I'm
working<00:01:18.930> ultimately<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.220> your

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
working ultimately it's just your

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
working ultimately it's just your
preference<00:01:20.759> some<00:01:21.390> people<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> draw<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
preference some people like to draw a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
preference some people like to draw a
real<00:01:22.350> big<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.830> others<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:24.060> me<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> draw

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
real big and others like me like to draw

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
real big and others like me like to draw
smaller<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> panel<00:01:27.150> with

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
smaller I when I was on the panel with

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.440 
smaller I when I was on the panel with

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
provided a good explanation for this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.960 
provided a good explanation for this
which<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.790> um

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
which is um

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.850 
which is um
when<00:01:37.970> using<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.690> larger<00:01:38.990> surface<00:01:39.200> generally

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
when using a larger surface generally

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.950 
when using a larger surface generally
you<00:01:39.980> tend<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.430> draw<00:01:40.670> with<00:01:41.270> your<00:01:41.420> shoulder<00:01:41.810> as

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
you tend to draw with your shoulder as

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.380 
you tend to draw with your shoulder as
the<00:01:42.080> pivot<00:01:42.260> point<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.890> if<00:01:43.790> you're<00:01:44.000> drawn<00:01:44.180> with

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
the pivot point and if you're drawn with

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.600 
the pivot point and if you're drawn with
a<00:01:44.420> large<00:01:44.780> like<00:01:44.990> 11<00:01:45.320> by<00:01:45.440> 17<00:01:45.890> or<00:01:46.040> something<00:01:46.310> wakem

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
a large like 11 by 17 or something wakem

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.120 
a large like 11 by 17 or something wakem
tablet<00:01:47.590> then<00:01:48.590> you're<00:01:48.710> going<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.860> be<00:01:49.010> using

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
tablet then you're going to be using

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.560 
tablet then you're going to be using
large<00:01:49.520> strokes<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.180> there's<00:01:50.300> nothing<00:01:50.390> wrong

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
large strokes and there's nothing wrong

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.180 
large strokes and there's nothing wrong
with<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.380> wanted<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.650> be<00:01:51.830> able<00:01:51.920> to

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
with that I just wanted to be able to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.460 
with that I just wanted to be able to
just<00:01:52.220> use<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:53.120> lot<00:01:53.510> of<00:01:53.540> small<00:01:53.960> ones<00:01:54.200> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
just use a lot of small ones that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.530 
just use a lot of small ones that
depending<00:01:54.860> on<00:01:54.980> how<00:01:55.190> far<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.000> was<00:01:56.150> zoomed<00:01:56.390> in

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
