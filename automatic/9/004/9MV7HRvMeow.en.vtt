00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 do not 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.980
 hi my natural how are we doing? 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.730
 finally the new update came out 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.039
 for annexes 4 android 4.4 of kitkat 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.680
 so let's see how it works in 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:21.990
 the 64 we will see the new improvements that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 they bring and nothing we approach with the video 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.710
 well first of all let's see the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.930
 appearance of the new android 4.4 in the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.840
 nexus 4 as you can see it with the naked eye 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.970
 does not bring many changes has 5 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.489
 desktop like the previous one can not be 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.650
 to anyone else the notification bar 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.480
 remains the same although they have 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.879
 changed some icons that are more 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.890
 attractive have also changed some 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 icons like the power of the call the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.460
 of the camera 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.010
 is similar to version 4.3 where it has 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.320
 changed more the appearance has been year 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.150
 Annex 5 as it brings the new launcher 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.540
 google home 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.770
 the notification bar that when the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.510
 unfold eses 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 transparent or the drawer is transparent 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.910
 the icons are bigger the bar is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.360
 takes advantage and puts the image inside and 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.820
 it seems that it is not a screen that looks like 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 does not remove screen but if you remove that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.540
 it also gets into the image and also 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.450
 the notification bar gets 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 Transparent buttons too but 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.170
 I forget that in the nexus 5 in the nexus 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.260
 4 as you can see it has not changed 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.280
 practically practically nothing in their 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.280
 design in appearance 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.440
 well let's talk a little about the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.660
 novelties that this new system brings 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.220
 operative first of all I do not 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.910
 I found many interesting novelties 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.130
 that they look like me but one that is 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.460
 that this system can work in a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.960
 system that has 512 mb of ram aurit 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 very fluid that not only be in a nexus 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 and that is not known at the moment 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.590
 I have not tried it and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.810
 surely someone will have approved it and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.080
 but come on, I think so for now 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.160
 that for example if we go to settings 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.480
 we are going to running applications 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:28.670
 As you can see it consumes very little 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.610
 399 megas almost 400 as you can see 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.459
 before me with the android 4.2.2 me 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 consumed over 600 700 with the android 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.190
 4.3 consumed over 500 more or less with 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.510
 the same applications and now consume 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.120
 over 300 400 has sometimes reached 350 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.880
 megas with the same applications like this 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.239
 that is very point a very good point 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.489
 in my favor also other news but 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.060
 in this device does not include 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.580
 example of google now if we configure it 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.220
 we can say ok a padlock but this in 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.340
 nexus 4 will not work this works in 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.100
 the nexus 5 since thanks to its snapdragon 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.780
 800 can you can use that function 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.290
 other functions as we have already said its 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.689
 design here nothing in the nexus 5 everything 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.790
 to change many applications fluency 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.849
 is one of your strengths for example 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.129
 I've noticed it and it's an improvement to me 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.219
 I like it and it's the one I like the most 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.219
 example 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.129
 the movement of one from a desk to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.970
 another is very fast better than the version 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:45.750
 4.3 For example , if we so as 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.530
 you can see any type of lag very fast 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.530
 the answer 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.470
 and I loved that for example 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.290
 from here to fit now 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.040
 or it will be the application is that it is very everything 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.350
 it works pretty fast better than before 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.820
 and that does not mean that the ship is not 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.870
 they have done a good job well in this 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.090
 point if they have also improved the battery 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.730
 the operating system and many other things 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.830
 that the additional features or 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.390
 some important ones that I have 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.810
 escaped I'll leave it down in the 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.290
 description so that the read is with 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.290
 details 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.520
 well let's see what aspects have been 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.190
 changed like that in the new system 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.900
 operative here for example to call 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.200
 has changed the interface as you can 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.120
 see is white we can click and 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.990
 find our contacts through the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.600
 voice call has also changed 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.310
 several interesting functions the clock 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.110
 this has also changed a little before 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.480
 we had it differently now what 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.970
 we have much easier 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.140
 also in adjustments we have a new 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.540
 printing option that we can print 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.120
 from our phone or from a 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.090
 tablet if we have a printer 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.250
 connected to google cloud print and it's 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.170
 Compatible because we can print things 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.560
 from our phone and that's 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.790
 pretty good more interesting things that 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.760
 you can do with 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.530
 with this good system that your 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.850
 performance as we have already said is 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:28.120
 pretty good for ram consumption 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.830
 that the battery is optimized more and that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.690
 can do many more good things down 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.940
 in the description as I said I'll leave it 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.690
 the features with more details 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.690
 so that the jce reads 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.790
 good to finish this video I will give 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.950
 my opinion about the new system 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.010
 operative I expected a little more 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.620
 but the truth is that the speed of a 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.810
 desk to another or to the drawer of 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.790
 applications has impressed me as a 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.730
 I like things to work 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.590
 pretty fast and pretty good since 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.720
 at the time for a paston aso by 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.360
 this phone and now I can enjoy it 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.250
 pretty good we're going to do very soon 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.380
 we are going to install the new nexus room 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:15.250
 5 in the nexus 4 is to say that we are going to 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:18.430
 have the entire 4.4 android here with your 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.260
 new with its new design with its bass what 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.680
 you are going to see in the next videos like this 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.780
 that nothing to follow us to be attentive to 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.220
 our videos and nothing I hope you 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.380
 I have liked any doubt of this 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.810
 new operating system to install it 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.760
 as 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.340
 Any doubt that you have power I 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.380
