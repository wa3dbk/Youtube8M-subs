00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 yes 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.300
 and thanks to that motor service 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.830
 international is following is informing 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.470
 about the presence of this which is the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.290
 front of front number 45 that already 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.699
 begins to have a decline in its 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.970
 structure is losing intensity to 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.829
 losing your important moments will be 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.319
 the condition that forms some cloudiness 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.989
 both in the middle of the east and in 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.039
 the southeast and the yucatan peninsula 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.470
 rainfall that can be here from 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.630
 light to occasionally moderate 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.329
 we will also wait for the wind 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.090
 start to also have an inclination 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.700
 towards the east and later we 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.250
 will stop doing that important North 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.290
 and it will be mainly from the southeast what 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.330
 we call surada for what is the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.270
 shoreline of the gulf of mexico and that everything 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.440
 this will come to give a slight rise of 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.130
 temperature on the road part of the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 Mexican republic 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.120
 On the other hand I can mention about the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.430
 moisture entry that comes from the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.750
 peaceful north to the north of the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 Baja California peninsula and 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.410
 we will wait for a cloudy formation and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.449
 some rainfall that go from 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.450
 light to occasionally moderate in the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.830
 northern tip of the low peninsula 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.810
 california entering 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.210
 places where rainfall is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.600
 may be present while the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.430
 temperature temperatures that follow 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.860
 marking the value is really very very 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.810
 elevated in the North Pacific with a 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.520
 sky can be cleared to medium 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.350
 cloudy just that kind of rainfall 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.650
 would be baja california in the rest it 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.320
 it will keep very very dry and very sunny in 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.790
 so much so that for the northeast where he 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.350
 you will remember that the mass of 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.150
 cold air but still losing 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.460
 intensity will gradually recovering 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.810
 little the balos of temperature the sky 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.729
 the sky of clear to cloudy 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.530
 some very light precipitation and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.450
 scattered in coahuila new lion and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.700
 tamaulipas but that is also going 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.440
 recovering this humidity situation 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.210
 there is a little more to the center of the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.410

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.290
