00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
area so there used to be a lot of

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.300 
area so there used to be a lot of
trading<00:00:43.750> back<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.380> forth<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.920> obviously

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
doors and turned them into the strange

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.440 
doors and turned them into the strange
creatures<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:56.590> see<00:00:56.770> obviously<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:58.300> much

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
creatures you see obviously not much

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.710 
creatures you see obviously not much
trading<00:00:58.750> has<00:00:58.900> been<00:00:59.079> going<00:00:59.290> on<00:00:59.380> since<00:00:59.440> then

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
trading has been going on since then

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.870 
trading has been going on since then
anyway<00:01:01.720> we<00:01:02.350> want<00:01:02.560> to<00:01:02.620> spend<00:01:02.950> all<00:01:03.130> our<00:01:03.550> money<00:01:03.579> at

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
anyway we want to spend all our money at

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.369 
anyway we want to spend all our money at
this<00:01:04.059> point<00:01:04.329> and<00:01:04.509> that<00:01:04.540> saw<00:01:04.900> for<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> very

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
this point and that saw for a very

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.130 
this point and that saw for a very
important<00:01:05.799> reason<00:01:06.509> pretty<00:01:07.509> obvious<00:01:07.569> but<00:01:07.899> you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
important reason pretty obvious but you

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.419 
important reason pretty obvious but you
are<00:01:08.200> going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.439> kill<00:01:08.560> ourselves<00:01:08.710> at<00:01:09.219> some

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
are going to kill ourselves at some

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.989 
are going to kill ourselves at some
point<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.799> we<00:01:11.950> can't<00:01:12.249> really<00:01:12.340> afford<00:01:12.490> this

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
point and we can't really afford this

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:14.550 
point and we can't really afford this
stuff<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:13.569> we'll<00:01:13.719> spy<00:01:14.049> what<00:01:14.259> we<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.469> afford

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
stuff so we'll spy what we can afford

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.320 
stuff so we'll spy what we can afford
which<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.069> these<00:01:15.219> red<00:01:15.460> potions

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 

one<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> cool<00:01:22.320> things<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.650> having<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
one of the cool things about having a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.510 
one of the cool things about having a
higher<00:01:23.280> rank<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.590> your<00:01:25.590> rank<00:01:25.800> also<00:01:26.100> determines

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
higher rank is your rank also determines

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.220 
higher rank is your rank also determines
how<00:01:26.610> much<00:01:26.730> when<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
how much when you start with when you

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.710 
how much when you start with when you
die<00:01:28.410> so<00:01:29.190> this<00:01:29.430> 2000<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> basically<00:01:30.600> nothing

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
die so this 2000 is basically nothing

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
die so this 2000 is basically nothing
just<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.290> point<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:31.620> if<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.010> killed

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
just at this point even if we get killed

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.790 
just at this point even if we get killed
we're<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.730> it<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:32.940> back<00:01:33.800> so
