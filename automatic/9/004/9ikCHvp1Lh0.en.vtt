tick-tocking away and this tells you a

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.089 
tick-tocking away and this tells you a
range<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.280> different<00:00:11.340> types<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.880> information

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
very useful prompt and that will change

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
very useful prompt and that will change
color<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.070> closer<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> start<00:00:36.059> of

doing all sorts of things like that

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.450 
doing all sorts of things like that
you've<00:00:40.170> also<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> few<00:00:41.100> other<00:00:41.219> buttons

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you've also got some a few other buttons

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.479 
you've also got some a few other buttons
down<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:42.500> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.649> actually<00:00:43.950> sort<00:00:44.129> buttons

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
down here you can actually sort buttons

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.010 
down here you can actually sort buttons
indicators<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:48.180> number

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
indicators you can see here this number

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.209 
indicators you can see here this number
that's<00:00:49.170> ticking<00:00:49.469> away<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.890> telling<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that's ticking away here is telling you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060 
that's ticking away here is telling you
how<00:00:50.489> many<00:00:50.989> milliseconds<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.410> takes<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
how many milliseconds it takes to get a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850 
how many milliseconds it takes to get a
response<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:53.670> bet<00:00:53.940> fairs<00:00:54.239> servers<00:00:54.930> bet

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
response from bet fairs servers bet

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
response from bet fairs servers bet
angel<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> first<00:00:56.730> products<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> ever<00:00:57.989> put

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
angel was the first products to ever put

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.770 
angel was the first products to ever put
this<00:00:58.530> sort<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> information<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.660> was

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this sort of information in and that was

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
this sort of information in and that was
simply<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.320> realized<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> was

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
simply because we realized it was

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.810 
simply because we realized it was
important<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.670> understand<00:01:03.210> how

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
important for you to understand how

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.890 
important for you to understand how
quickly<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.030> were<00:01:06.090> getting<00:01:06.330> response<00:01:06.720> back

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
quickly you were getting response back

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.170 
quickly you were getting response back
because<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.590> starts<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.610> lengthen

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
because if this starts to lengthen

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.940 
because if this starts to lengthen
dramatically<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.799> moment

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
dramatically you can see at the moment

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
dramatically you can see at the moment
it's<00:01:11.189> refreshing<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.850> hundred<00:01:12.170> gallop

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it's refreshing about a hundred gallop

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
it's refreshing about a hundred gallop
Vega<00:01:13.560> did<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.340> happened<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:15.259> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
Vega did you see what happened there and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.260 
Vega did you see what happened there and
that<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.520> downloading<00:01:17.909> an

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that was because i was downloading an

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.530 
that was because i was downloading an
email<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> background<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:20.540> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
email in the background and that that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
email in the background and that that
basically<00:01:21.990> increased<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> time<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
basically increased the time out of it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.260 
basically increased the time out of it
so<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.400> generally<00:01:23.759> running<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so it's generally running at about a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
so it's generally running at about a
hundred<00:01:24.360> milliseconds<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.710> words

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
hundred milliseconds here in other words

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.969 
hundred milliseconds here in other words
a<00:01:25.950> tenth<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> second<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
a tenth of a second and if you see a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
a tenth of a second and if you see a
spike<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.000> time<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.750> start

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
spike in that then that's time to start

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
spike in that then that's time to start
getting<00:01:31.290> concerned<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:31.970> our<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
getting concerned because our the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240 
getting concerned because our the
betfair<00:01:33.420> slowing<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.350> there's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
betfair slowing down or there's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.770 
betfair slowing down or there's
something<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.790> another<00:01:36.090> process<00:01:36.600> on

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
something going on another process on

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.969 
something going on another process on
your<00:01:36.900> machine<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.439> slowing<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
your machine that's slowing down your

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
your machine that's slowing down your
machine<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> I've<00:01:39.450> add

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
machine so you can see here and I've add

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.859 
machine so you can see here and I've add
an<00:01:39.810> accept<00:01:40.200> 400<00:01:40.409> milliseconds<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.720> were

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
an accept 400 milliseconds so we were

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.740 
an accept 400 milliseconds so we were
the<00:01:42.930> first<00:01:42.990> people<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> ever<00:01:43.649> use<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the first people to ever use this in a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.490 
the first people to ever use this in a
product<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.560> designed<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.369> aid<00:01:48.500> your

product and it was designed to aid your

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.719 
product and it was designed to aid your
understanding<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.340> connection<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
understanding of how your connection is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.210 
understanding of how your connection is
performing<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:52.619> did<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.100> we

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
performing but what we also did is we

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.270 
performing but what we also did is we
realize<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.560> there<00:01:55.560> were<00:01:55.649> two<00:01:55.799> things<00:01:56.009> going

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
realize that there were two things going

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.389 
realize that there were two things going
on<00:01:56.490> getting<00:01:56.939> odds<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:58.049> from<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> betting

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
on getting odds back from the betting

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
on getting odds back from the betting
exchange<00:01:59.790> was<00:02:00.000> quite<00:02:00.630> quick<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> simple<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
exchange was quite quick and simple and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.990 
exchange was quite quick and simple and
that<00:02:01.590> seemed<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> fairly<00:02:02.369> consistent<00:02:02.939> but

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that seemed to be fairly consistent but

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.389 
that seemed to be fairly consistent but
what<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.210> noticed<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.399> retrieving

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
what we noticed was that retrieving

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.190 
what we noticed was that retrieving
unmatched<00:02:05.939> bed<00:02:06.149> information<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.810> match<00:02:06.930> bed

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
unmatched bed information and match bed

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
unmatched bed information and match bed
information<00:02:07.740> seems<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> Achilles

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
information seems to be the Achilles

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.290 
information seems to be the Achilles
heel<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:10.379> exchange<00:02:11.099> there's<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.940> very<00:02:12.090> good

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
heel of the exchange there's a very good

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.270 
heel of the exchange there's a very good
technical<00:02:12.540> reason

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
technical reason

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.800 
technical reason
why<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> case<00:02:14.820> but<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.240> won't<00:02:15.420> bore

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
why that is the case but I won't bore

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.320 
why that is the case but I won't bore
you<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.560> particular<00:02:16.710> video

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
you with that in this particular video

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.680 
you with that in this particular video
but<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.690> why<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.490> exchange<00:02:21.390> has

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
but we know why the exchange has

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.180 
but we know why the exchange has
difficulty<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.860> not<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> other

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
difficulty with one and not the other

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.590 
difficulty with one and not the other
and<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.610> way<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.970> works<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.420> that's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
and the way that it works for that's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.870 
and the way that it works for that's
that's<00:02:24.840> an<00:02:24.960> engineering<00:02:25.350> tech<00:02:25.650> issue<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.760> what

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that's an engineering tech issue so what

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.100 
that's an engineering tech issue so what
we<00:02:26.970> did<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.210> well<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.600> actually<00:02:27.720> put<00:02:28.080> this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
we did as well as we actually put this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.570 
we did as well as we actually put this
one<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.770> here<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.190> see<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.430> is

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
one in here you can see this is

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.980 
one in here you can see this is
responding<00:02:30.000> slightly<00:02:30.360> slower<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.870> is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
responding slightly slower but this is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.050 
responding slightly slower but this is
actually<00:02:31.110> tell<00:02:31.530> asking<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.820> information

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
actually tell asking for information

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.520 
actually tell asking for information
surrounding<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.930> amount<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.200> bets<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
surrounding the amount of bets that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.770 
surrounding the amount of bets that
you've<00:02:34.680> placed<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.030> information<00:02:36.630> you've

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you've placed and the information you've

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.470 
you've placed and the information you've
got<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> system<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.700> stuff<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.180> so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
got in the system and stuff like that so

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.640 
got in the system and stuff like that so
you've<00:02:39.570> got<00:02:39.600> two<00:02:39.810> different<00:02:39.960> indicators<00:02:40.350> one

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
you've got two different indicators one

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.470 
you've got two different indicators one
is<00:02:40.800> how<00:02:40.950> fast<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> odds<00:02:41.490> coming<00:02:41.820> down<00:02:41.970> one

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
is how fast are the odds coming down one

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.430 
is how fast are the odds coming down one
is<00:02:42.630> how<00:02:42.780> fast<00:02:43.700> are<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.270> bets<00:02:45.780> coming<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.260> how

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
is how fast are the bets coming down how

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.170 
is how fast are the bets coming down how
fast<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.040> information<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.640> unmatched<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
fast is information on unmatched and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.600 
fast is information on unmatched and
match<00:02:48.300> bets<00:02:48.540> coming<00:02:48.900> down<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.220> example<00:02:50.280> we

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
match bets coming down if for example we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.030 
match bets coming down if for example we
saw<00:02:50.820> both<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.300> these<00:02:51.480> suddenly<00:02:52.440> grinds<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
saw both of these suddenly grinds to a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.500 
saw both of these suddenly grinds to a
halt<00:02:53.280> we've<00:02:53.550> also<00:02:53.700> got<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.210> button

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
halt we've also got this little button

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.140 
halt we've also got this little button
here<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.990> they<00:02:55.890> are<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.520> click<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> are

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
here and they are if we click on the are

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.510 
here and they are if we click on the are
that<00:02:57.540> basically<00:02:57.930> breaks<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.500> connection<00:02:58.620> to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
that basically breaks the connection to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.700 
that basically breaks the connection to
the<00:02:59.610> exchange<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.270> attempts<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> reconnect

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
the exchange and attempts to reconnect

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.700 
the exchange and attempts to reconnect
so<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.730> allows<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.480> basically<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.560> do

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
so that allows you basically if you do

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.990 
so that allows you basically if you do
see<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> problem<00:03:05.190> or<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.520> think<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.850> there's

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
see a problem or you think that there's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
see a problem or you think that there's
an<00:03:06.090> issue<00:03:06.180> click<00:03:07.020> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.230> big<00:03:07.350> red<00:03:07.410> are<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
an issue click on the big red are and I

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.920 
an issue click on the big red are and I
will<00:03:08.550> break<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.910> connection<00:03:09.090> reconnection

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
will break the connection reconnection

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.430 
will break the connection reconnection
reconnect<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.800> for<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.070> restart<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> whole

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
reconnect it for you restart the whole

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.100 
reconnect it for you restart the whole
process<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.610> allows<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.390> keep<00:03:15.960> an

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
process and that allows you to keep an

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.020 
process and that allows you to keep an
eye<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.260> how<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.740> exchange<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.580> performing

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
eye on how the exchange is performing

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.300 
eye on how the exchange is performing
and<00:03:18.150> how<00:03:18.240> your<00:03:18.390> connection<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:18.930> performing<00:03:19.440> if

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and how your connection is performing if

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.610 
and how your connection is performing if

the screen here and betfair limits your

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.730 
the screen here and betfair limits your
data<00:03:32.820> requests<00:03:33.420> per<00:03:33.600> second<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.260> 20<00:03:34.590> per

data requests per second to 20 per
second<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:36.150> if<00:03:36.510> you're<00:03:36.690> running<00:03:36.780> two<00:03:37.050> copies

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
second so if you're running two copies

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.740 
second so if you're running two copies
of<00:03:37.470> bed<00:03:37.650> angel<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.220> could<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.580> example<00:03:38.750> just

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
of bed angel you could for example just

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.240 
of bed angel you could for example just
reduce<00:03:40.020> that<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> 10<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.740> you've<00:03:40.830> got<00:03:40.890> 10

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
reduce that to 10 so you've got 10

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.440 
reduce that to 10 so you've got 10
running<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.870> both<00:03:42.870> individual<00:03:43.350> copies<00:03:44.450> but

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
running on both individual copies but

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.699 
running on both individual copies but
typically<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.840> want<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.410> many<00:03:46.560> as

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
typically you want to have as many as

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.010 
typically you want to have as many as
you<00:03:46.800> can<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.010> second<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.180> hominy<00:03:48.660> you're<00:03:48.780> doing

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
you can a second the hominy you're doing

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.990 
you can a second the hominy you're doing
a<00:03:49.080> second<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.560> located<00:03:50.100> down<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.820> this

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
a second is located down here so this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.610 
a second is located down here so this
actually<00:03:51.120> tells<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.959> you're<00:03:52.110> doing<00:03:52.260> 12

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
actually tells you that you're doing 12

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.210 
actually tells you that you're doing 12
4<00:03:52.950> i'm<00:03:53.070> doing<00:03:53.430> 12<00:03:53.700> 13<00:03:54.120> 14<00:03:54.620> 10<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.980> can<00:03:56.100> see

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
4 i'm doing 12 13 14 10 you can see

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.760 
4 i'm doing 12 13 14 10 you can see
there's<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.459> mixture<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.630> slow<00:03:57.990> down<00:03:58.260> how

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
there's a mixture if I slow down how

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.880 
there's a mixture if I slow down how
fast<00:03:59.070> I'm<00:03:59.280> refreshing<00:03:59.880> bet<00:04:00.570> angel<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.170> can

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
fast I'm refreshing bet angel and can

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.520 
fast I'm refreshing bet angel and can
you<00:04:01.920> can<00:04:02.130> see<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.459> drops<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.970> response

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
you can see that that drops in response

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.690 
you can see that that drops in response
so<00:04:04.530> there<00:04:04.680> are<00:04:04.709> many<00:04:04.980> different<00:04:05.370> aspects

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
so there are many different aspects

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.430 
so there are many different aspects
whether<00:04:05.880> you've<00:04:06.030> got<00:04:06.060> full<00:04:06.570> market<00:04:06.900> depth<00:04:07.170> on

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
whether you've got full market depth on

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.250 
whether you've got full market depth on
how<00:04:07.709> fast<00:04:08.670> your<00:04:08.910> refreshing<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:10.020> sort<00:04:10.200> of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
how fast your refreshing the sort of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.630 
how fast your refreshing the sort of
data<00:04:10.470> you're<00:04:10.770> pulling<00:04:11.070> down<00:04:11.220> all<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.520> those

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
data you're pulling down all of those

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.660 
data you're pulling down all of those
things<00:04:11.700> have<00:04:12.540> an<00:04:12.660> effect<00:04:12.989> on<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:14.220> amount<00:04:14.550> of

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
things have an effect on the amount of

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.159 
things have an effect on the amount of
data<00:04:14.880> requests<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.510> are<00:04:15.570> sending<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.020> if<00:04:16.109> I

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
data requests you are sending so if I

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.880 
data requests you are sending so if I
speed<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.620> up<00:04:16.680> again<00:04:17.930> you'll<00:04:18.930> see<00:04:19.020> at<00:04:19.739> what

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
speed this up again you'll see at what

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.320 
speed this up again you'll see at what
I've<00:04:20.010> done<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.280> change<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.609> refresh<00:04:20.940> here

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
I've done is change the refresh here

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.390 
I've done is change the refresh here
from<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.750> second<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.290> 200<00:04:22.800> milliseconds<00:04:23.310> as

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
from one second to 200 milliseconds as

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.430 
from one second to 200 milliseconds as
five<00:04:23.610> times<00:04:23.880> faster<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:24.960> see<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.229> count

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
five times faster you can see the count

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.470 
five times faster you can see the count
goes<00:04:25.620> up

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
goes up

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
goes up
if<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.570> want<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.780> limit<00:04:27.960> how<00:04:28.200> many<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.620> of

if you want to limit how many you of

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.520 
if you want to limit how many you of
these<00:04:29.700> counts<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.420> want<00:04:30.660> per<00:04:30.840> second<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.350> can

these counts you want per second you can

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.040 
these counts you want per second you can

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
logged on with this will allow you to

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.760 
logged on with this will allow you to
actually<00:05:13.650> home<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.080> speed<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.590> style

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
actually home this the speed and style

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.250 
actually home this the speed and style
of<00:05:16.950> your<00:05:17.070> connection<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.840> can<00:05:18.990> put<00:05:19.110> that

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
of your connection so you can put that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.770 
of your connection so you can put that
up<00:05:19.410> to<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.830> very<00:05:20.190> high<00:05:20.370> number<00:05:20.430> such<00:05:21.000> as<00:05:21.030> 100<00:05:21.600> and

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
up to a very high number such as 100 and

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.870 
up to a very high number such as 100 and
this<00:05:22.320> would<00:05:22.470> basically<00:05:22.590> have<00:05:22.950> no<00:05:23.280> effect<00:05:23.700> on

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
this would basically have no effect on

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.900 
this would basically have no effect on
your<00:05:24.440> connection<00:05:25.440> but<00:05:26.250> your<00:05:26.370> objective<00:05:26.790> with

the connection mode to know it's a

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.150 
the connection mode to know it's a

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
combination of which connection mode

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.630 
combination of which connection mode
you're<00:05:29.490> logged<00:05:30.270> in<00:05:30.420> at<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:31.310> what<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.430> want

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
you're logged in at and what you want

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.890 
you're logged in at and what you want
out<00:05:32.790> of<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:33.000> performance<00:05:33.390> but<00:05:33.480> if<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.660> pull<00:05:33.870> a

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
out of the performance but if you pull a

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.280 
out of the performance but if you pull a
connection<00:05:34.320> mode<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.680> nur<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.430> left<00:05:36.290> this

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
connection mode to nur to the left this

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.660 
connection mode to nur to the left this
will<00:05:37.470> basically<00:05:37.560> improve<00:05:38.190> your<00:05:38.310> connection

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
will basically improve your connection

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.150 
will basically improve your connection
speed<00:05:38.760> if<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.000> pull<00:05:39.180> it<00:05:39.270> too<00:05:39.450> far<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:39.960> left

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
speed if you pull it too far to the left

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.410 
speed if you pull it too far to the left
what<00:05:41.160> will<00:05:41.280> happen<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.730> your<00:05:41.880> connection<00:05:42.090> may

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
what will happen is your connection may

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.080 
what will happen is your connection may
freeze<00:05:42.720> so<00:05:43.110> it's<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.740> question<00:05:44.280> of<00:05:44.460> trial<00:05:44.970> and

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
freeze so it's a question of trial and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.810 
freeze so it's a question of trial and
error<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.570> determine<00:05:46.470> which<00:05:46.650> is<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.010> best

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.980 

figure<00:05:50.820> that<00:05:51.030> you<00:05:51.150> want<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.690> have<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:51.960> the

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
figure that you want to have on the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.520 
figure that you want to have on the
connection<00:05:52.470> mituna<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.190> that's<00:05:53.790> down<00:05:54.090> to

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
connection mituna and that's down to

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.770 
connection mituna and that's down to
individual<00:05:56.060> circumstances<00:05:57.060> your<00:05:57.270> connection

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
individual circumstances your connection

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.470 
individual circumstances your connection
have<00:05:58.140> fast<00:05:58.440> your<00:05:58.680> computer<00:05:59.040> is<00:05:59.190> all<00:06:00.090> these

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
have fast your computer is all these

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.780 
have fast your computer is all these
different<00:06:00.840> variables<00:06:01.470> we're<00:06:02.430> basically<00:06:02.550> you

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
different variables we're basically you

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.740 
different variables we're basically you
on<00:06:02.880> that<00:06:03.000> number<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.300> be<00:06:03.390> as<00:06:03.450> low<00:06:03.600> as<00:06:03.690> possible

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
on that number to be as low as possible

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.940 
on that number to be as low as possible
without<00:06:04.910> locking<00:06:05.910> up<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.960> software<00:06:07.140> so<00:06:07.890> you

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
without locking up the software so you

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.190 
without locking up the software so you
know<00:06:08.100> if<00:06:08.220> you<00:06:08.310> started<00:06:08.790> its<00:06:08.970> 20<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:09.780> started

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
know if you started its 20 and started

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.630 
know if you started its 20 and started
to<00:06:10.290> move<00:06:10.380> it<00:06:10.530> down<00:06:10.650> in<00:06:10.830> small<00:06:11.040> increments<00:06:11.190> and

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
to move it down in small increments and

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.660 
to move it down in small increments and
see<00:06:11.820> how<00:06:12.620> the<00:06:13.620> software<00:06:13.800> responds<00:06:14.490> to<00:06:14.640> that

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
see how the software responds to that

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.700 
see how the software responds to that
that<00:06:15.240> will<00:06:15.450> definitely<00:06:16.050> improve<00:06:16.530> your

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
that will definitely improve your

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.410 
that will definitely improve your
performance<00:06:16.800> so<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.460> combination<00:06:18.000> of<00:06:18.090> looking

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
performance so a combination of looking

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.240 
performance so a combination of looking
at<00:06:18.540> the<00:06:18.900> numbers<00:06:19.230> that<00:06:19.260> you<00:06:19.470> see<00:06:19.530> down<00:06:19.710> here

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
at the numbers that you see down here

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.820 
at the numbers that you see down here
the<00:06:21.090> your<00:06:21.270> connection<00:06:21.750> mode<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.230> they<00:06:22.650> can

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
the your connection mode and they can

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.460 
the your connection mode and they can
and<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.250> dynamic<00:06:23.790> connection<00:06:24.330> tuner<00:06:24.690> will

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
and the dynamic connection tuner will

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.880 
and the dynamic connection tuner will
allow<00:06:25.680> you<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:25.890> improve<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.880> performance<00:06:27.030> of

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
allow you to improve the performance of

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.050 
allow you to improve the performance of
potential<00:06:28.890> and<00:06:28.950> obviously<00:06:29.280> if<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:29.910> have<00:06:30.030> a

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
potential and obviously if you have a

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.340 
potential and obviously if you have a
much<00:06:30.240> better<00:06:30.390> performance<00:06:30.630> in<00:06:30.870> other<00:06:31.050> people

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
much better performance in other people

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.440 
much better performance in other people
then<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.670> will<00:06:32.880> perform<00:06:33.750> better<00:06:34.220> overall<00:06:35.450> but

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
then you will perform better overall but

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.820 
then you will perform better overall but
those<00:06:36.570> are<00:06:36.720> some<00:06:36.840> of<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:36.960> more<00:06:37.410> advanced

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
those are some of the more advanced

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.040 
those are some of the more advanced
features<00:06:37.860> that<00:06:38.280> you<00:06:38.370> have<00:06:38.550> to<00:06:38.760> do

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
features that you have to do

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.450 
features that you have to do
connecting<00:06:39.590> to<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.830> exchange<00:06:39.979> with
