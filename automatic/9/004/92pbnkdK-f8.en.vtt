like at first with the PKM is the actual
iron<00:02:05.480> site<00:02:05.810> but<00:02:06.500> once<00:02:06.980> you<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.220> used<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.610> its

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
iron site but once you get used to its

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.060 
iron site but once you get used to its
aiming<00:02:08.149> mechanics<00:02:08.720> which<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.680> should<00:02:09.920> get

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
aiming mechanics which you should get

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.310 
aiming mechanics which you should get
used<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.399> relatively<00:02:10.940> quick<00:02:11.170> should<00:02:12.170> no

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
used to relatively quick should no

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.680 
used to relatively quick should no
longer<00:02:12.350> be<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.800> problem<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.640> even<00:02:14.180> though<00:02:14.450> it

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
longer be a problem and even though it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.420 
longer be a problem and even though it
does<00:02:14.840> seem<00:02:15.050> awkward<00:02:15.260> at<00:02:15.560> first<00:02:15.590> when<00:02:16.280> it's

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
does seem awkward at first when it's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.540 
does seem awkward at first when it's
going<00:02:16.700> down<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.090> iron<00:02:17.240> site<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.750> take<00:02:17.960> aim<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
going down the iron site to take aim the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.520 
going down the iron site to take aim the
great<00:02:19.820> part<00:02:20.090> about<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> very

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
great part about it is that it is a very

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.160 
great part about it is that it is a very
open<00:02:21.740> site<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.880> levels<00:02:23.240> up<00:02:23.420> really<00:02:23.900> well

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
open site and it levels up really well

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
open site and it levels up really well
with<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.390> know<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.540> PKM<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.710> doesn't<00:02:27.980> take

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
with you know the PKM so it doesn't take

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
with you know the PKM so it doesn't take
up<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.580> good<00:02:28.730> field<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.240> view<00:02:29.390> while<00:02:29.660> you're

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
up a good field of view while you're

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.400 
up a good field of view while you're
trying<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.290> aim<00:02:31.040> downrange<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.870> open<00:02:33.200> top

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.820 
trying to aim downrange so the open top
of<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.740> site<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.100> actually<00:02:34.430> really<00:02:34.610> nice<00:02:35.830> as

of the site is actually really nice as

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
you get with the PKM is 480 and you get

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.490 
you get with the PKM is 480 and you get
120<00:03:05.390> bullets<00:03:05.690> per<00:03:05.959> ammo<00:03:06.820> magazine<00:03:07.820> box<00:03:08.500> that

120 bullets per ammo magazine box that
you<00:03:09.530> get

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
you get

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.369 
you get
now<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.700> only<00:03:12.090> negative<00:03:12.480> aspect<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.200> can

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
now the only negative aspect that I can

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.129 
now the only negative aspect that I can
think<00:03:13.409> of<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.219> PKM<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.870> even

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
think of with the PKM is that even

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.839 
think of with the PKM is that even
though<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.920> well-rounded<00:03:17.489> light

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
though it is a well-rounded light

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.119 
though it is a well-rounded light
machine<00:03:18.209> gun<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.930> means<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.709> doesn't<00:03:19.889> really

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
machine gun that means it doesn't really

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.160 
machine gun that means it doesn't really
have<00:03:20.370> much<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.670> anything<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.269> stand<00:03:21.540> out<00:03:21.780> from

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
have much of anything to stand out from

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.199 
have much of anything to stand out from
any<00:03:22.349> stellar<00:03:23.099> points<00:03:23.549> from<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.819> rest<00:03:23.999> of<00:03:24.120> the

like that like I said that's due to it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.920 
like that like I said that's due to it
being<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:29.909> well<00:03:30.120> rounded<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.689> all<00:03:30.810> that
