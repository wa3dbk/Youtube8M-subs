00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 you can take everything cool before and then 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.210
 finishing school one early 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 it turns out that you only learn about the first 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 term for 100 class lunch plan 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.270

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.840
 America who ask ask very often 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.160
 This is America I lived in the country under 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.990
 name of Kazakhstan 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.760

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.190
 nationality Russian game will be released 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.050

 how quickly did you learn english i took 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.830
 class and called sl at school because 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.700
 I'm afraid this is not our English we 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.230
 must take 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.180
 but I also talked with Americans 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.250
 English came to me because 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.620
 Little play had to communicate with 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.660
 Americans what do you do at school 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.459
 after school we have different circles a 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.800
 Now I leave to them but it is also true 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.440
 Russian radio and of course dancing with 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.120
 flags what grades school get us 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 seems like a semester comes a card with 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.910
 full semester grades 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.340
 at the moment she is very come 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.959
 so I also received such marks 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.400
 over these places do not take offense to you 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.560
 American school because you 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.970
 I came from Russia is not in America for you 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.220
 I will never offend to all 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.950

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.870
 equally in class blue places asks 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.000
 tag invite America began to learn words 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.519
 or in English-speaking environment English 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.220
 he came English himself came to me 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.320
 but I had to learn 10 words a week and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.019
 at the end of the week I wrote from the teacher 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.820
 to memorize and spelling too you 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.130
 pay for school tuition 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.600
 free of charge but you have to pay for books 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.150
 which you buy but also 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.700
 Registration to school costs $ 320 a 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.130
 I know something about the first day of school 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.739
 only words hi somehow talked at all 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.170
 teachers and classmates in the first 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.980
 the day I just sat and looked at everyone 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.720
 these americans 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.850
 and not less understood but a lot of people 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.440
 They wanted to talk to me at the break 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.850
 people just ran up to services and 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.650
 talk though I could not them 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.030
 answer but we still enjoyed it once 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.980
 slater so they wrote on 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.600
 English or one in Russian and then I 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.489
 described in Russian we will pass in English 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.940
 That's how we communicated probably the first two 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.030
 of the week 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.670
 de barros i have a height of 5.6 species and in 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.280

 family well and also your friends and 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.870
 To be honest, I thought that the first week 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.860
 just a fairy tale and nothing at all 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.780
