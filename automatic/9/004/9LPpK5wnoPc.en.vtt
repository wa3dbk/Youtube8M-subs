which is what happens with a person

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
which is what happens with a person
who's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> professional<00:01:50.939> vana<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
who's not a professional vana see you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.109 
who's not a professional vana see you
have<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> concentrate<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.280> getting<00:01:53.820> too

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
have to concentrate on not getting too

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
have to concentrate on not getting too
much<00:01:54.149> varnish<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.049> area<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.649> too<00:01:56.159> little

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
much varnish in this area and too little

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.399 
much varnish in this area and too little
over<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.390> area<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.930> possibly

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
over here so this area could possibly

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.740 
over here so this area could possibly
run<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> could<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.610> dry<00:01:59.880> spots<00:02:00.270> over<00:02:00.540> here

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
run or you could get dry spots over here

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
run or you could get dry spots over here
so<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.439> easiest<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.100> me<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.119> with

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so the easiest way for me would be with

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.709 
so the easiest way for me would be with
a<00:02:03.390> four<00:02:03.719> inch<00:02:03.930> foam<00:02:04.229> roller<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.340> that's

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
a four inch foam roller and what that's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.150 
a four inch foam roller and what that's
designed<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.290> distribute<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
designed to do is to distribute it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800 
designed to do is to distribute it
properly<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.849> then<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.149> gonna<00:02:09.270> pick<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.660> a

corner alright I've brushed out the
details<00:03:38.040> around<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.459> top<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.909> the<00:03:39.000> box<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
details around the top of the box and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.000 
details around the top of the box and
now<00:03:39.659> I'm<00:03:39.780> gonna<00:03:39.900> start<00:03:40.230> applying<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.859> varnish

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
now I'm gonna start applying the varnish

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.399 
now I'm gonna start applying the varnish
with<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> little<00:03:41.699> foam<00:03:42.000> roller<00:03:42.419> here<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.019> I'm

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
with a little foam roller here and I'm

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.289 
with a little foam roller here and I'm
gonna<00:03:43.500> start<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:43.979> this<00:03:44.129> corner<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:45.030> here

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
gonna start in this corner right here

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.420 
gonna start in this corner right here
because<00:03:45.629> this<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.169> back<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.739> box<00:03:47.069> back

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
because this is the back of the box back

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.789 
because this is the back of the box back
here<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.479> just<00:03:48.510> want<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.989> finish<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
here and I just want to finish up on the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.649 
here and I just want to finish up on the
back<00:03:50.010> corner<00:03:50.459> rather<00:03:50.699> than<00:03:50.879> finish<00:03:51.209> up<00:03:51.389> on<00:03:51.540> the

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
back corner rather than finish up on the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.420 
back corner rather than finish up on the
front<00:03:51.900> corner<00:03:52.290> where<00:03:52.409> it's<00:03:52.530> more<00:03:52.709> visible

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
front corner where it's more visible

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.309 
front corner where it's more visible
I<00:03:53.459> mean<00:03:53.970> I'm<00:03:54.090> first<00:03:54.389> I'm<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.659> working<00:03:55.199> is

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
I mean I'm first I'm just working is

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.259 
I mean I'm first I'm just working is
saturating<00:03:56.099> this<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.519> roller<00:03:56.760> here<00:03:57.030> all

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
saturating this little roller here all

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.180 
saturating this little roller here all
the<00:03:57.389> way<00:03:57.510> around<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:57.930> one<00:03:58.260> side<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.889> isn't

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
the way around so one side of it isn't

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.800 
the way around so one side of it isn't
any<00:03:59.310> heavier<00:03:59.729> than<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.180> other<00:04:00.329> because

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
any heavier than the other because

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.170 
any heavier than the other because
otherwise<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.440> doesn't<00:04:01.620> want<00:04:01.919> to<00:04:02.180> balance

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
otherwise it doesn't want to balance

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.599 
otherwise it doesn't want to balance
itself<00:04:03.780> properly<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:04.769> there<00:04:04.949> we<00:04:05.099> go<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.579> now

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
itself properly and there we go so now

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.089 
itself properly and there we go so now
we're<00:04:05.970> gonna<00:04:06.060> go<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.449> apply<00:04:06.750> some<00:04:06.780> right<00:04:07.769> to

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
we're gonna go and apply some right to

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.970 
we're gonna go and apply some right to
the<00:04:08.220> box

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
the box

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.649 
the box
start<00:04:10.280> right<00:04:10.459> on<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.670> corner<00:04:11.060> here<00:04:13.299> roll<00:04:14.299> some

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
start right on the corner here roll some

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.840 
start right on the corner here roll some
around<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.200> corner<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:16.430> then<00:04:16.579> I'm<00:04:16.699> gonna

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
around that corner and then I'm gonna

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.090 
around that corner and then I'm gonna
start<00:04:17.120> rolling<00:04:17.359> back<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.959> forth<00:04:18.500> across<00:04:18.799> the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
start rolling back and forth across the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.390 
start rolling back and forth across the
whole<00:04:19.280> surface<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.220> distribute<00:04:22.220> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
whole surface so that I distribute the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.939 
whole surface so that I distribute the
varnish<00:04:22.850> evenly<00:04:23.600> all<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.139> way<00:04:24.260> across<00:04:24.560> there

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
varnish evenly all the way across there

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.810 
varnish evenly all the way across there
now<00:04:25.580> I'm<00:04:25.699> gonna<00:04:25.820> roll<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.449> another<00:04:26.810> pattern

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
now I'm gonna roll it in another pattern

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.330 
now I'm gonna roll it in another pattern
diagonally<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:32.290> now<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.650> roller<00:04:33.860> create

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
diagonally like so now the roller create

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.250 
diagonally like so now the roller create
some<00:04:34.580> air<00:04:34.880> bubbles<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.600> that's<00:04:35.870> one<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
some air bubbles and that's one of the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.230 
some air bubbles and that's one of the
reasons<00:04:36.620> why<00:04:36.770> we<00:04:37.040> want<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.340> tip<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.120> out

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
reasons why we want to tip it out

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.200 
reasons why we want to tip it out
afterwards<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:40.010> knock<00:04:40.280> down<00:04:40.580> all<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:41.000> air

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
afterwards to knock down all the air

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.779 
afterwards to knock down all the air
bubbles<00:04:41.630> when<00:04:42.620> you're<00:04:42.770> rolling<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.310> Tiffany

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
bubbles when you're rolling and Tiffany

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.850 
bubbles when you're rolling and Tiffany
the<00:04:44.000> paint<00:04:44.330> or<00:04:44.539> varnish<00:04:44.900> it's<00:04:45.320> important<00:04:45.800> to

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the paint or varnish it's important to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.860 
the paint or varnish it's important to
remember<00:04:46.130> they've<00:04:46.490> got<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.910> keep<00:04:47.120> moving<00:04:47.630> so

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
remember they've got to keep moving so

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.920 
remember they've got to keep moving so
we're<00:04:48.350> going<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.620> apply<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.039> varnishes

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
we're going to apply the varnishes

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.629 
we're going to apply the varnishes
rapidly<00:04:50.930> as<00:04:51.050> possible<00:04:51.139> with<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.039> roller<00:04:52.280> and

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
rapidly as possible with the roller and

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.370 
rapidly as possible with the roller and
switch<00:04:52.970> over<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.539> tip<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.930> as<00:04:54.050> soon<00:04:54.229> as

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
switch over to the tip and as soon as

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.680 
switch over to the tip and as soon as
possible<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.760> we<00:04:55.880> can<00:04:56.060> tip<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.360> while

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
possible so that we can tip it while

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.810 
possible so that we can tip it while
it's<00:04:56.870> still<00:04:57.110> nice<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.440> wet<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.520> flows

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
it's still nice and wet so that it flows

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.550 
it's still nice and wet so that it flows
out<00:04:59.090> nice<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.419> flat<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.199> won't<00:05:00.350> have<00:05:00.500> to

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
out nice and flat and we won't have to

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.760 
out nice and flat and we won't have to
return<00:05:01.039> to<00:05:01.400> those<00:05:01.520> areas<00:05:01.880> as<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.720> dries<00:05:03.320> so

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
return to those areas as it dries so

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.969 
return to those areas as it dries so
we're<00:05:04.130> actually<00:05:04.870> trying<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.960> decide<00:05:06.620> how<00:05:06.830> much

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
we're actually trying to decide how much

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.159 
we're actually trying to decide how much
varnish<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.639> apply<00:05:07.970> as<00:05:08.300> we<00:05:08.600> go<00:05:08.780> along

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
varnish to apply as we go along

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.990 
varnish to apply as we go along
there's<00:05:09.500> no<00:05:09.680> set<00:05:10.039> rule<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.760> it's<00:05:10.910> just

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
there's no set rule to it it's just

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.330 
there's no set rule to it it's just
pretty<00:05:11.330> much<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.600> feel<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.710> know<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:13.070> want<00:05:13.250> it

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
pretty much a feel you know you want it

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.000 
pretty much a feel you know you want it
to<00:05:13.430> feel<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:13.940> same<00:05:14.240> under<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.690> roller<00:05:15.080> as

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
to feel the same under the roller as

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.680 
to feel the same under the roller as
well<00:05:16.400> as<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.700> want<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.090> feel<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.450> same

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
well as you want it to feel the same

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.480 
well as you want it to feel the same
under<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.080> brush<00:05:18.440> when<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.800> tip<00:05:19.070> it<00:05:19.099> so<00:05:19.430> you

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
under the brush when you tip it so you

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.089 
under the brush when you tip it so you
don't<00:05:19.729> have<00:05:19.820> any<00:05:20.000> real<00:05:20.240> heavy<00:05:20.570> spots<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.979> any

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
don't have any real heavy spots and any

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.610 
don't have any real heavy spots and any
real<00:05:22.370> light<00:05:22.639> spots<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.360> that's<00:05:23.479> why<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.720> reroll

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
real light spots and that's why I reroll

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.400 
real light spots and that's why I reroll
it<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.919> few<00:05:25.160> times<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.610> try<00:05:25.910> to<00:05:26.410> redistribute

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
it a few times to try to redistribute

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.520 
it a few times to try to redistribute
that<00:05:28.280> varnish<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:28.940> that<00:05:29.389> you've<00:05:29.960> got<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.289> same

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
that varnish so that you've got the same

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.430 
that varnish so that you've got the same
amount<00:05:30.849> the<00:05:31.849> tipping's<00:05:32.270> being<00:05:32.539> done<00:05:32.870> now<00:05:33.169> on

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
amount the tipping's being done now on

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.719 
amount the tipping's being done now on
the<00:05:33.560> front<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.919> box<00:05:34.160> with<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.430> badger

the front of the box with the badger
hair<00:05:35.030> brush<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:36.020> idea<00:05:36.380> is<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.680> tip<00:05:37.280> from

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
hair brush and the idea is to tip from

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.610 
hair brush and the idea is to tip from
one<00:05:37.849> end<00:05:38.210> of<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.510> box<00:05:38.780> all<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.110> way<00:05:39.320> to<00:05:39.380> the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.379 
one end of the box all the way to the
other<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.039> don't<00:05:40.220> have<00:05:40.340> any<00:05:40.550> stop<00:05:40.910> marks

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
other so you don't have any stop marks

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.029 
other so you don't have any stop marks
in<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.630> middle<00:05:41.900> or<00:05:41.990> anything<00:05:42.200> like<00:05:42.530> that<00:05:42.590> and

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
in the middle or anything like that and

the distributions been done in front of

the distributions been done in front of
me<00:05:45.620> with<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.860> roller<00:05:46.070> so<00:05:46.610> I<00:05:46.669> don't<00:05:46.849> have<00:05:46.970> to

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
me with the roller so I don't have to

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.180 
me with the roller so I don't have to
move<00:05:47.479> the<00:05:47.750> varnish<00:05:48.139> around<00:05:48.500> very<00:05:48.770> much<00:05:49.010> I'm

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
move the varnish around very much I'm

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.100 
move the varnish around very much I'm
just<00:05:49.220> looking<00:05:49.760> to<00:05:49.789> flatten<00:05:50.450> it<00:05:50.539> out<00:05:50.660> knock<00:05:50.960> the

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
just looking to flatten it out knock the

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.960 
just looking to flatten it out knock the
bubbles<00:05:51.440> out<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.680> it<00:05:51.950> it's<00:05:52.310> I'm<00:05:52.460> coordinating

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
bubbles out of it it's I'm coordinating

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.690 
bubbles out of it it's I'm coordinating
my<00:05:53.539> vision<00:05:54.500> with<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.860> height<00:05:55.070> of<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.460> light

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
my vision with the height of the light

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.150 
my vision with the height of the light
so<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.120> I<00:05:56.150> get<00:05:56.330> a<00:05:56.360> nice<00:05:56.599> reflection<00:05:57.169> off<00:05:57.710> the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
so that I get a nice reflection off the

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.180 
so that I get a nice reflection off the
varnish<00:05:58.580> so<00:05:58.610> they<00:05:58.880> can<00:05:59.000> see<00:05:59.389> exactly<00:05:59.990> what<00:06:00.979> I'm

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
varnish so they can see exactly what I'm

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.940 
varnish so they can see exactly what I'm
doing<00:06:01.220> with<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.330> brush<00:06:02.660> I'm<00:06:03.110> not<00:06:03.440> doing<00:06:03.830> it

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
doing with the brush I'm not doing it

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.820 
doing with the brush I'm not doing it
without<00:06:04.070> being<00:06:04.580> able<00:06:04.729> to<00:06:04.880> see<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.990> reflection

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830

of the light in the Box this varnish is

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.270 
of the light in the Box this varnish is
rolling<00:06:10.789> on<00:06:10.910> so<00:06:11.300> well<00:06:11.660> that<00:06:12.050> in<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.919> front<00:06:13.160> of

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
the box I only rolled 1/3 of the box but

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.629 
the box I only rolled 1/3 of the box but
on<00:06:15.919> this

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
on this

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.879

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
back of the box here I've just rolled

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.159 
back of the box here I've just rolled
out<00:06:19.159> half<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.849> length<00:06:20.060> of<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.330> box<00:06:20.569> with<00:06:20.900> one

out half the length of the box with one

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.070 
out half the length of the box with one
roller<00:06:21.500> fall<00:06:21.949> here<00:06:22.189> just<00:06:22.460> like<00:06:22.669> that<00:06:22.939> now<00:06:23.840> that

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
roller fall here just like that now that

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.140 
roller fall here just like that now that
would<00:06:24.229> be<00:06:24.259> pretty<00:06:24.650> tricky<00:06:25.219> to<00:06:25.370> distribute

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
would be pretty tricky to distribute

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.809 
would be pretty tricky to distribute
that<00:06:26.330> as<00:06:26.599> evenly<00:06:27.199> as<00:06:27.319> that<00:06:27.740> with<00:06:27.979> a<00:06:28.009> brush<00:06:28.430> you

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
that as evenly as that with a brush you

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.360 
that as evenly as that with a brush you
know<00:06:29.509> quite<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.840> bit<00:06:30.110> of<00:06:30.199> honest<00:06:30.560> squeezed<00:06:31.189> out

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
know quite a bit of honest squeezed out

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.950 
know quite a bit of honest squeezed out
of<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.550> roller<00:06:31.819> up<00:06:32.120> here<00:06:32.360> so<00:06:32.539> I'll<00:06:32.659> just<00:06:32.810> go

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
of the roller up here so I'll just go

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.100 
of the roller up here so I'll just go
pick<00:06:33.229> that<00:06:33.289> back<00:06:33.770> up<00:06:33.800> again<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.900> move<00:06:35.900> it<00:06:36.080> down

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
pick that back up again and move it down

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.800 
pick that back up again and move it down
in<00:06:36.650> this<00:06:37.159> particular<00:06:37.550> situation<00:06:38.120> we've

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
in this particular situation we've

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.020 
in this particular situation we've
rolled<00:06:39.169> and<00:06:39.500> tipped<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:40.099> varnish<00:06:40.580> and<00:06:40.789> that

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
rolled and tipped the varnish and that

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.209 
rolled and tipped the varnish and that
was<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:41.599> method<00:06:41.990> that<00:06:42.139> we<00:06:42.289> use<00:06:42.319> because<00:06:43.009> we

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
was the method that we use because we

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.189 
was the method that we use because we
wanted<00:06:43.550> to<00:06:43.729> cover<00:06:44.030> as<00:06:44.330> much<00:06:44.539> ground<00:06:44.599> as

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
wanted to cover as much ground as

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.860 
wanted to cover as much ground as
possible<00:06:45.259> as<00:06:46.129> fast<00:06:46.430> as<00:06:46.729> possible<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:47.479> get<00:06:47.629> all

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
possible as fast as possible and get all

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.959 
possible as fast as possible and get all
the<00:06:48.229> way<00:06:48.379> around<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.889> box<00:06:49.069> to<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.490> other<00:06:49.520> end

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:49.969 
the way around the box to the other end

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.119 
the way around the box to the other end
where<00:06:50.330> we<00:06:50.360> started<00:06:50.990> without<00:06:51.680> having<00:06:52.009> the

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129 
where we started without having the

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.369 
where we started without having the
varnish<00:06:52.490> going<00:06:52.849> off<00:06:53.120> on<00:06:53.360> us<00:06:53.389> completely<00:06:54.139> and

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
varnish going off on us completely and

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.369 
varnish going off on us completely and
have<00:06:54.889> attacking<00:06:55.430> mess<00:06:55.639> when<00:06:55.819> we<00:06:55.940> got<00:06:56.120> there<00:06:56.330> so

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:56.379 
have attacking mess when we got there so

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.059 
have attacking mess when we got there so
it<00:06:57.379> was<00:06:57.740> a<00:06:57.770> fast<00:06:58.430> and<00:06:58.879> easy<00:06:59.360> technique<00:06:59.750> now<00:07:00.680> in

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
it was a fast and easy technique now in

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.510 
it was a fast and easy technique now in
other<00:07:01.430> situations<00:07:02.270> with<00:07:02.539> more<00:07:02.919> detail<00:07:03.919> you

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
other situations with more detail you
