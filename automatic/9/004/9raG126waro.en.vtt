00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of the episode is definitely one of the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.310 
of the episode is definitely one of the
highlights<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.780> action<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
highlights because all of the action and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
highlights because all of the action and
choreography<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.460> cool<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.299> really

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
choreography is really cool it's really

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
choreography is really cool it's really
fast<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.110> fluid<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.890> moments<00:01:23.040> when

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
fast and fluid in there are moments when

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
fast and fluid in there are moments when
they<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:23.580> slow<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> down<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> really

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
they actually slow it down and I really

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
they actually slow it down and I really
like<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like that because you get to see all of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
like that because you get to see all of
their<00:01:26.520> moves<00:01:26.729> sort<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.600> flying<00:01:27.990> through

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
their moves sort of like flying through

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380 
their moves sort of like flying through

grabbed<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.360> were<00:01:42.420> leaving<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
grabbed them as they were leaving and I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
grabbed them as they were leaving and I
just<00:01:43.170> thought<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.950> awesome

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just thought that was really awesome

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
just thought that was really awesome
there<00:01:44.939> were<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.479> moments<00:01:45.869> like

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
there were a lot of little moments like

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
there were a lot of little moments like
that<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> made<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.560> episode<00:01:46.829> cool<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that that made this episode cool and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
that that made this episode cool and
this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> where<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.299> our<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.689> first<00:01:48.930> clue

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
this is where we get our very first clue

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
this is where we get our very first clue
as<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.649> how<00:01:49.770> Toby's<00:01:50.189> abilities<00:01:50.579> work<00:01:50.850> now

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
as to how Toby's abilities work now

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.940 
as to how Toby's abilities work now
there's<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.899> part<00:01:52.170> where<00:01:52.290> Kakashi<00:01:52.590> throws

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
there's this part where Kakashi throws

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.679 
there's this part where Kakashi throws
this<00:01:53.159> kunai<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.240> infused<00:01:54.540> with

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this kunai and it's infused with

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.969 
this kunai and it's infused with
lightning<00:01:55.020> shocker<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:55.950> his

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
lightning shocker and he has to use his

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
lightning shocker and he has to use his
calmly<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.329> teleport<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> away<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
calmly on it to teleport it away and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920 
calmly on it to teleport it away and
then<00:01:59.009> suddenly<00:01:59.430> he<00:01:59.549> realizes<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> Toby<00:02:00.750> has

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then suddenly he realizes that Toby has

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.450 
then suddenly he realizes that Toby has
this<00:02:01.110> scratch<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.590> his<00:02:01.740> mask<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
this scratch on his mask and that's the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
this scratch on his mask and that's the
only<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.509> could<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.750> scratched<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
only thing that could have scratched it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.350 
only thing that could have scratched it
was<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> kunai<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.670> went<00:02:05.880> away<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
was that kunai that went away to the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
was that kunai that went away to the
other<00:02:06.509> dimension<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:07.799> how<00:02:08.009> does<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.369> work

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
other dimension but how does this work

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.150 
other dimension but how does this work
exactly<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:10.410> kakashi<00:02:10.560> has<00:02:11.009> this

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
exactly so this is when kakashi has this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.040 
exactly so this is when kakashi has this
theory<00:02:11.430> he<00:02:11.730> thinks<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.090> toby<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.660> possibly

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
theory he thinks that toby is possibly

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.700 
theory he thinks that toby is possibly
connected

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
connected

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.170 
connected
to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> dimension<00:02:14.280> where<00:02:14.550> he<00:02:14.670> sends<00:02:14.910> things

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
to the dimension where he sends things

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.300 
to the dimension where he sends things
so<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.170> one<00:02:16.320> kakashi's<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:16.950> Captain

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so this is one kakashi's like Captain

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.620 
so this is one kakashi's like Captain
America<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.730> he's<00:02:17.880> orchestrating<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
America and he's orchestrating the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.170 
America and he's orchestrating the
entire<00:02:18.930> battle<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.560> he<00:02:20.190> sends<00:02:20.430> Naruto<00:02:20.850> out<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
entire battle and he sends Naruto out to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.640 
entire battle and he sends Naruto out to
fight<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.690> he<00:02:21.750> tells<00:02:21.960> him<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.110> use<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> rasengan

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
fight and he tells him to use a rasengan

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.650 
fight and he tells him to use a rasengan
and<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.490> he<00:02:23.670> starts<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.120> use<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.480> go

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
and as he starts to use it and go

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.930 
and as he starts to use it and go
through<00:02:24.870> Toby's<00:02:25.230> body<00:02:25.470> suddenly<00:02:26.340> Kakashi

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
through Toby's body suddenly Kakashi

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.510 
through Toby's body suddenly Kakashi
uses<00:02:27.360> his<00:02:27.510> calmly<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> Rasengan<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.340> then

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
uses his calmly on the Rasengan and then

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.000 
uses his calmly on the Rasengan and then
they<00:02:29.850> pan<00:02:30.090> over<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.510> Toby<00:02:31.080> shoulder<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.680> then

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
they pan over to Toby shoulder and then

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
they pan over to Toby shoulder and then
it<00:02:32.130> starts<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.460> bubble<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.180> boom<00:02:33.600> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
it starts to bubble up and boom it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.500 
it starts to bubble up and boom it
freakin<00:02:34.230> explodes<00:02:34.850> Rasengan<00:02:35.850> hit<00:02:36.060> some<00:02:36.240> point

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.450 
freakin explodes Rasengan hit some point
blank<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.140> sends<00:02:37.380> him<00:02:37.560> flying<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> nice

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
blank and it sends him flying in a nice

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.370 
blank and it sends him flying in a nice
little<00:02:38.640> visual<00:02:38.910> touch<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.510> he's<00:02:39.780> sliding<00:02:40.140> away

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
little visual touch as he's sliding away

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.830 
little visual touch as he's sliding away
his<00:02:41.070> fin<00:02:41.400> gets<00:02:41.670> caught<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.180> rock<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.720> it

his fin gets caught on this rock and it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.570 
his fin gets caught on this rock and it
just<00:02:43.020> makes<00:02:43.170> his<00:02:43.350> body<00:02:43.590> flail<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> little<00:02:44.430> bit

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
just makes his body flail a little bit

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.940 
just makes his body flail a little bit

which is fantastic because it's also
another<00:03:04.710> clue<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:06.120> who<00:03:06.240> he<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.050> while<00:03:07.350> all
