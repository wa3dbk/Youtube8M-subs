00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 place everyone knows shocked hope 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.400
 that you're fine me it's going nickel and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.560
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 new video we are at episode number 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.400
 5 of the illogical about gta 5 may before 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.049
 start the episode if we could 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.839
 try to beat the thumb record 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.270
 blue on episode number 3 which is at + 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.220
 2 773 like and well it would make me 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.779
 extremely pleasure and it encourages me 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 rey to introduce you to the next 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 episodes 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.029
 what I find illogical about gta 5 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.970
 so there you see the gameplay that binds to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 a bmx and so look at it it is posed 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.300
 normally so watch it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 standing but be aware that he is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 of obo mail is nothing that holds it there is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.210
 not even hold feet or anything else that can 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.520
 hold it normally in real life 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 if you position a bmx this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.899
 way they should fall but there on 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.090
 gta 5 they did not you for me it's 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.710
 really illogical 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 what I find illogical about gta 5 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.410
 so there you see to the gameplay that this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.539
 be beside a waterfall 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.520
 she looked at the little wall that separates 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 the highway and down the road where I 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.020
 am and logically broken normally 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 in real life it should be repaired 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 as quickly as possible but there in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.450
 gta 5 they did not even pay attention 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.580
 they do not even have fences or 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.560
 others to avoid falling back there they 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 have totally ignored and that's really 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.950
 illogical maybe there you are in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.420
 tell me it's done on purpose 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.430
 it's just for a waterfall but she has 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.869
 looked at you can see the ground on the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 road and down there are markings 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.659
 yellow in real life it means eh 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 but there will be works 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.549
 soon or even if it has not already 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.130
 started and the yellow marking ebale are 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.780
 there since gta 5 is out that wants 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.860
 to say that it's been more than two years 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.860
 that he did not touch 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 so I find it really illogical what 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.490
 that I find illogical on gta 5 so 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 watch it at the gameplay you're in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.479
 train to see that there is a pnj that is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.189
 eating a bene and you go 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.960
 see later he did not chew a 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.670
 only once in it I have the impression 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.780
 that he does on purpose to simulate and that's 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.720
 really what the fuck 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.729
 For my part, I find it illogical 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.649
 that I find illogical about gta 5 for 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.840
 to steal a vehicle we have to break and fight 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.880
 the window to then put our 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 hand inside the vehicle and open 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.140
 the door but by cons if we take 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.850
 a gun is fired on the window the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.110
 window it breaks eh ben we did not 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 need to get our arm back to 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.489
 inside the vehicle to open the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.460
 door is really illogical and this 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.160
 I do not like it 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.510
 request from rockstar and so 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.610
 here is the end of this episode 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.200
 hoping that you liked it 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.540
 if you too know things 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.310
 really illogical about gta 5 and beats 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.170
 do not hesitate to suggest them to me 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.430
 in the comments you can 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.080

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.160

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.200
 on gta 5 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.940
 do not hesitate to go see them 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.560

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.270
