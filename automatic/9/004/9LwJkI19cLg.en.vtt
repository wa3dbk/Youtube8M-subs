00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
we can follow it around so that we could

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
we can follow it around so that we could
stay<00:01:41.070> away<00:01:41.430> from<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> pesky<00:01:42.119> behemoths<00:01:42.630> at

this<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.740> actually<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.579> did<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.540> my

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this time now actually I did this on my

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.679 
this time now actually I did this on my
first<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.320> around<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.149> level<00:01:48.509> wasn't

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
first time around so my level wasn't

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.660 
first time around so my level wasn't
really<00:01:49.079> strong<00:01:49.920> enough<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.310> didn't<00:01:50.520> really

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
really strong enough I didn't really

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
really strong enough I didn't really
feel<00:01:50.820> too<00:01:51.030> confident<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> could<00:01:51.960> take<00:01:52.140> on

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
feel too confident that I could take on

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.950 
feel too confident that I could take on
all<00:01:53.009> behemoths<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.820> time<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.840> was

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
all behemoths at this time so it was

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
all behemoths at this time so it was
best<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> avoid<00:01:55.799> him<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> different

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
best to avoid him but on a different

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
best to avoid him but on a different
note<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.630> feel<00:01:57.840> confident<00:01:58.350> enough<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
note if you feel confident enough to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
note if you feel confident enough to
fight<00:01:58.860> him<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.070> actually<00:01:59.430> might<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.579> not<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
fight him it actually might be not be a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
fight him it actually might be not be a
bad<00:02:00.540> idea<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.369> if

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
bad idea because when you go back and if

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.770 
bad idea because when you go back and if
you're<00:02:02.579> strong<00:02:02.939> enough<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.360> actually<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you're strong enough it actually is a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.420 
you're strong enough it actually is a
good<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> farm<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.680> souls<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
good way to farm some souls because I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.199 
good way to farm some souls because I
think<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.079> 300<00:02:07.079> CP<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:08.250> defeating

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
so the legend may not be as far-fetched

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.010 
so the legend may not be as far-fetched
and<00:03:31.530> absurd<00:03:31.800> as<00:03:31.950> some<00:03:32.100> may<00:03:32.220> think<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:33.900> we

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
and absurd as some may think I think we

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.300 
and absurd as some may think I think we
finally<00:03:34.410> found<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.710> piece<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> very

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
finally found a piece to a very

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.070 
finally found a piece to a very
important<00:03:35.760> puzzle<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.570> puzzle<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.990> our

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
important puzzle the puzzle of our

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.610 
important puzzle the puzzle of our
history<00:03:38.330> evolution<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.020> that's<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.470> right

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
history evolution so that's it right

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.710 
history evolution so that's it right
there<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.070> we<00:03:41.160> got<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.460> all<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.970> Clotho<00:03:42.480> right

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
there so we got the all of Clotho right

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.290 
there so we got the all of Clotho right
there<00:03:42.990> so<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:43.709> our<00:03:43.740> next<00:03:44.310> fragment<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:44.970> this

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
there so now our next fragment in this

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.590 
there so now our next fragment in this
video<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.959> sword<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.640> Lachesis<00:03:47.640> now<00:03:48.450> in

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
video is the sword of Lachesis now in

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.150 
video is the sword of Lachesis now in
order<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.870> get<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.170> we<00:03:49.290> need<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.500> jump<00:03:49.740> on<00:03:49.830> old

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
order to get this we need to jump on old

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.000 
order to get this we need to jump on old
chocobo<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.240> is<00:03:51.420> also<00:03:51.630> available<00:03:52.010> after

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
chocobo and this is also available after

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.460 
chocobo and this is also available after
we<00:03:53.209> exhaust<00:03:54.209> all<00:03:54.390> conversation<00:03:55.050> with<00:03:55.230> hope

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
we exhaust all conversation with hope

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.580 
we exhaust all conversation with hope
when<00:03:55.650> we're<00:03:55.800> on<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:57.060> particular<00:03:57.330> stage<00:03:57.780> so

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
when we're on this particular stage so

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.960 
when we're on this particular stage so
when<00:03:58.770> we<00:03:58.830> reach<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.220> point<00:03:59.490> right<00:03:59.610> here<00:03:59.820> we

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
when we reach this point right here we

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.120 
when we reach this point right here we
do<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.270> chocobo<00:04:00.720> jump<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:01.860> see<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130

bearing fruit it's an amazing subject to
research<00:04:29.250> but<00:04:29.760> as<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.780> can<00:04:30.960> see<00:04:31.020> at<00:04:31.350> this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
research but as you can see at this

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.890 
research but as you can see at this
stage<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:32.130> still<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.370> flower<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:33.090> don't<00:04:33.720> know

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
stage it's still a flower I don't know

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.750 
stage it's still a flower I don't know
exactly<00:04:34.020> how<00:04:34.440> long<00:04:34.800> it'll<00:04:34.950> take<00:04:35.070> or<00:04:35.520> when

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
exactly how long it'll take or when

exactly how long it'll take or when
it'll<00:04:36.000> produce<00:04:36.240> fruit<00:04:36.919> but<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:37.950> do<00:04:38.070> know<00:04:38.490> it's

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
it'll produce fruit but I do know it's

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.190 
it'll produce fruit but I do know it's
unlikely<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.180> it'll<00:04:39.540> happen<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:39.990> my

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.490 
unlikely that it'll happen in my
lifetime<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.340> can<00:04:41.580> still<00:04:41.820> hope<00:04:42.090> can't<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.600> so

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
lifetime but I can still hope can't I so

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.310 
lifetime but I can still hope can't I so
let's<00:04:43.800> go<00:04:43.950> ahead<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.520> accept<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.570> mission<00:04:45.900> TV

of Fenrir for me I don't think it's

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.830 
of Fenrir for me I don't think it's
possible<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.880> find<00:04:51.090> one<00:04:51.360> when<00:04:51.510> there's<00:04:51.690> no

like this flower can bear fruit without

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.870 
like this flower can bear fruit without
lights<00:06:25.260> so<00:06:25.919> that's<00:06:26.130> it<00:06:26.280> right<00:06:26.400> there<00:06:26.460> so<00:06:26.729> as

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
lights so that's it right there so as

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.070 
lights so that's it right there so as
you<00:06:27.000> can<00:06:27.090> see<00:06:27.150> we<00:06:27.330> have<00:06:27.449> this<00:06:27.600> sort<00:06:27.840> of

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
you can see we have this sort of

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.920 
you can see we have this sort of
Lachesis<00:06:28.770> right<00:06:29.220> there<00:06:29.460> so<00:06:30.060> like<00:06:30.479> I<00:06:30.570> said<00:06:30.630> in

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
Lachesis right there so like I said in

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.350 
Lachesis right there so like I said in
order<00:06:31.229> to<00:06:31.380> get<00:06:31.830> both<00:06:32.039> fragments<00:06:32.360> both

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
order to get both fragments both

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.310 
order to get both fragments both
missions<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:34.440> actually<00:06:35.010> need<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:35.310> only<00:06:35.729> have

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
missions you actually need to only have

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.750 
missions you actually need to only have
you<00:06:37.320> can't<00:06:37.560> have<00:06:37.740> two<00:06:37.949> active<00:06:38.400> missions

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
you can't have two active missions

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.219 
you can't have two active missions
because<00:06:39.090> then<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.360> actually<00:06:39.570> won't<00:06:39.900> even<00:06:40.139> be

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
because then you actually won't even be

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.469 
because then you actually won't even be
able<00:06:40.410> to<00:06:40.560> talk<00:06:41.130> to<00:06:41.310> the<00:06:41.400> person<00:06:41.610> so<00:06:42.000> if<00:06:42.330> you

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
able to talk to the person so if you

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.540 
able to talk to the person so if you
can't<00:06:42.750> talk<00:06:42.990> to<00:06:43.139> these<00:06:43.229> individuals<00:06:43.550> then

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
can't talk to these individuals then

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.830 
can't talk to these individuals then
that<00:06:44.669> means<00:06:44.849> you<00:06:45.000> already<00:06:45.150> have<00:06:45.479> too<00:06:45.750> many

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
that means you already have too many

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.900 
that means you already have too many
active<00:06:46.380> missions<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.280> think<00:06:47.490> the<00:06:47.610> most<00:06:47.789> you

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
active missions and I think the most you

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.120 
active missions and I think the most you
can<00:06:48.030> have<00:06:48.150> active<00:06:48.389> at<00:06:48.660> a<00:06:48.690> time<00:06:48.960> is<00:06:49.169> two<00:06:49.410> and<00:06:49.650> so

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
can have active at a time is two and so

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.409 
can have active at a time is two and so
you<00:06:50.639> know<00:06:50.729> there's<00:06:50.910> a<00:06:50.940> lot<00:06:51.090> of<00:06:51.120> back-and-forth

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
you know there's a lot of back-and-forth

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.390 
you know there's a lot of back-and-forth
that<00:06:52.020> you<00:06:52.169> need<00:06:52.320> to<00:06:52.440> do<00:06:52.590> between<00:06:52.770> Yash's

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
that you need to do between Yash's

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.930 
that you need to do between Yash's
massive<00:06:53.849> ten<00:06:54.509> and<00:06:54.780> Yash's<00:06:55.169> massive<00:06:55.620> one<00:06:56.190> xaf

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
massive ten and Yash's massive one xaf

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.580 
massive ten and Yash's massive one xaf
so<00:06:57.330> that's<00:06:57.479> pretty<00:06:57.660> much<00:06:57.840> it<00:06:58.050> you<00:06:58.080> guys<00:06:58.380> so

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
so that's pretty much it you guys so
