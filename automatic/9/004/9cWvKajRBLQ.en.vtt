00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
answer just make sure to keep your
fingers<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.550> blade<00:01:47.730> what<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
fingers out the way the blade what you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.640 
fingers out the way the blade what you
don't<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.480> curl<00:01:48.900> them<00:01:49.050> around<00:01:49.080> like<00:01:49.500> that

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
don't do is curl them around like that

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.440 
don't do is curl them around like that
keep<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.010> up<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.330> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
keep them up out of the way because you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
keep them up out of the way because you
don't<00:01:51.570> want<00:01:51.840> them<00:01:51.960> getting<00:01:52.080> caught<00:01:52.409> between

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the blade and the board and then you

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.610 
the blade and the board and then you
have<00:02:01.590> finely<00:02:01.979> chopped<00:02:02.159> passing
