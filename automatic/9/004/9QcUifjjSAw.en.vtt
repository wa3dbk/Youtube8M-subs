straight down I'm actually holding shift

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.990 
straight down I'm actually holding shift
on<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> ladder<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.489> fall<00:00:56.760> into

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
on the ladder so I don't fall into

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.840 
on the ladder so I don't fall into
anything<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:58.050> there's<00:00:58.289> stuff<00:00:58.500> below<00:00:59.489> me<00:00:59.640> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
anything if there's stuff below me so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
anything if there's stuff below me so
just<00:01:00.030> hold<00:01:00.120> shift<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:01.289> mind<00:01:01.530> below<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
just hold shift and then mind below you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
just hold shift and then mind below you
and<00:01:02.719> go<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> way<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:05.240> level

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and go all the way down to about level

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.929 
and go all the way down to about level
I'd<00:01:06.540> say<00:01:07.970> level<00:01:08.970> 12<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.659> 11<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.670> see

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I'd say level 12 or 11 so if you can see

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
I'd say level 12 or 11 so if you can see
in<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:13.280> middle<00:01:14.280> left<00:01:14.520> there's<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.360> why<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
in the middle left there's a why like a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
in the middle left there's a why like a
letter<00:01:17.009> Y<00:01:17.220> there's<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.610> XY<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.060> Z<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.869> when

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
letter Y there's an XY and Z so when

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190 
letter Y there's an XY and Z so when
that<00:01:19.170> Y<00:01:19.409> gets<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.070> 11<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.820> 12<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:22.020> should

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that Y gets to like 11 or 12 you should

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
that Y gets to like 11 or 12 you should
stop<00:01:22.350> mining<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> i'm<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> speed

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
stop mining and i'm just going to speed

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
stop mining and i'm just going to speed
up<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> clip<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:26.939> i<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
up the clip here so that when i get to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.780 
up the clip here so that when i get to
the<00:01:27.360> bottom<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the bottom we can you don't have to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
the bottom we can you don't have to
watch<00:01:29.909> me<00:01:29.939> mind<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
watch me mind my way all the way to the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.810 
watch me mind my way all the way to the
bottom

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:02:08.770 

you

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.719 

alright<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.830> I've<00:02:09.920> made<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.190> all<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.490> way<00:02:10.520> down

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
alright so I've made it all the way down

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.710 
alright so I've made it all the way down
to<00:02:10.759> level<00:02:11.980> 12<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:14.090> recommend<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.569> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
to level 12 and I recommend going to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.030 
to level 12 and I recommend going to
this<00:02:14.870> level<00:02:15.080> because<00:02:15.319> diamond<00:02:15.650> level<00:02:15.800> is

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
this level because diamond level is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.199 
this level because diamond level is
roughly<00:02:16.520> level<00:02:17.420> 1<00:02:17.900> through<00:02:18.350> 15<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.209> lava

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
roughly level 1 through 15 and lava

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.290 
roughly level 1 through 15 and lava
level<00:02:20.630> starts<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.140> round<00:02:21.319> level<00:02:21.590> 10<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.010> 11<00:02:22.730> so

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
level starts to round level 10 and 11 so

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.150 
level starts to round level 10 and 11 so
you<00:02:23.390> won't<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:23.780> able<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.260> won't<00:02:24.440> hit<00:02:24.830> lava

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
you won't be able to you won't hit lava

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.540 
you won't be able to you won't hit lava
and<00:02:25.810> you'll<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.959> able<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.319> mine<00:02:27.709> safely<00:02:28.280> so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
and you'll be able to mine safely so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.559 
and you'll be able to mine safely so
next<00:02:29.420> what<00:02:29.569> you're<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.870> want<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.230> is

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
next what you're going to want to do is

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:39.510 
next what you're going to want to do is
dig<00:02:32.569> out<00:02:32.750> an<00:02:32.930> area<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.819> can<00:02:34.970> move<00:02:35.120> around

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.800 

and<00:02:40.520> as<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.300> see<00:02:41.330> we<00:02:41.480> already<00:02:41.600> found

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and as you can see we already found

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.280 
and as you can see we already found
diamonds<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:44.090> yeah<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.630> dig<00:02:44.780> out<00:02:44.930> an<00:02:45.080> area

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
diamonds so yeah just dig out an area

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.580 
diamonds so yeah just dig out an area
that<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.650> move<00:02:46.400> around<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.140> yeah<00:02:48.140> if<00:02:48.410> you

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
that you can move around and yeah if you

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.960 
that you can move around and yeah if you
get<00:02:48.739> lucky<00:02:48.890> you'll<00:02:49.250> find<00:02:49.489> diamonds<00:02:49.700> right

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
get lucky you'll find diamonds right

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.280 
get lucky you'll find diamonds right
away<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.590> did<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.830> got<00:02:52.160> diamonds<00:02:52.700> here

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.979 

so<00:02:57.290> right<00:02:57.530> now<00:02:57.560> I've<00:02:57.800> dug<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.220> 3<00:02:58.760> by<00:02:59.360> 3<00:02:59.390> space

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
so right now I've dug out a 3 by 3 space

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.440 
so right now I've dug out a 3 by 3 space
and<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.880> dig<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.239> little

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
and I'm going to dig this a little

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.990 
and I'm going to dig this a little
longer<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:04.220> we're<00:03:04.340> going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.550> make<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.880> around

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.850 

six<00:03:11.000> or<00:03:11.150> seven<00:03:11.510> by<00:03:11.630> three<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.739> dig

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
six or seven by three and you can dig

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.319 
six or seven by three and you can dig
this<00:03:13.010> out<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.310> long<00:03:13.519> as<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.850> want<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.209> doesn't

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
this out as long as you want it doesn't

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.390 
this out as long as you want it doesn't
really<00:03:14.540> matter<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.350> longer<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.739> mind<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
really matter the longer you mind the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.880 
really matter the longer you mind the
better<00:03:16.579> chance<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.180> have<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:18.230> finding

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
better chance you have of finding

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.000 
better chance you have of finding
diamonds<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.290> once<00:03:21.440> you've<00:03:21.590> dug<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:21.950> out

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
diamonds so once you've dug that out

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.670 
diamonds so once you've dug that out
you're<00:03:22.730> going<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.910> want<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.290> light<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.470> place

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
you're going to want to light this place

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.160 
you're going to want to light this place
up<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:25.070> little<00:03:25.100> bit<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.640> can<00:03:25.700> see<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.180> next

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
up a little bit so you can see and next

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.920 
up a little bit so you can see and next
what<00:03:27.290> you're<00:03:27.410> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.739> do<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:28.269> start<00:03:29.269> poking

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
what you're going to do is start poking

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.330 
what you're going to do is start poking
holes<00:03:31.000> every<00:03:32.739> other<00:03:33.739> block<00:03:34.190> like<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:37.100> our

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
holes every other block like this so our

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.710 
holes every other block like this so our
know<00:03:37.549> every<00:03:37.820> other<00:03:37.940> two<00:03:38.209> blocks<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:38.630> you're

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
know every other two blocks so you're

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.660 
know every other two blocks so you're
going<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.870> leave<00:03:39.019> two<00:03:39.170> blocks<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.680> so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
going to leave two blocks like this so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.509 
going to leave two blocks like this so
what<00:03:41.120> this<00:03:41.239> technique<00:03:41.690> does<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:43.250> going

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
what this technique does is it's going

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.400 
what this technique does is it's going
to<00:03:43.640> maximize<00:03:44.600> your<00:03:44.720> chance<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.109> finding

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
to maximize your chance of finding

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.800 
to maximize your chance of finding
diamonds<00:03:45.590> in<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:45.950> shortest<00:03:46.250> amount<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.579> time

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
diamonds in the shortest amount of time

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.720 
diamonds in the shortest amount of time
so<00:03:47.950> right<00:03:48.950> here<00:03:49.130> you're<00:03:49.280> going<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.549> seeing

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
so right here you're going to be seeing

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.330 
so right here you're going to be seeing
this<00:03:49.940> block<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:50.750> block<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.920> block<00:03:52.070> above

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
this block this block the block above

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.430 
this block this block the block above
you<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.579> block<00:03:52.760> below<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.480> really<00:03:54.260> if<00:03:54.320> you

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
you the block below you so really if you

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.009 
you the block below you so really if you
mind<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:54.829> this<00:03:54.950> path<00:03:55.430> right<00:03:55.730> here<00:03:55.760> um<00:03:56.720> you'd

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
mind in this path right here um you'd

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
mind in this path right here um you'd
already<00:03:57.470> be<00:03:57.739> seeing<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.160> block<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.609> there's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
already be seeing this block so there's

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.130 
already be seeing this block so there's
really<00:03:58.910> no<00:03:59.120> point<00:03:59.359> so<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.750> have<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.959> better

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
really no point so you have a better

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.259 
really no point so you have a better
chance<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.620> finding<00:04:00.799> diamonds<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.519> what

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
chance of finding diamonds and what

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.490 
chance of finding diamonds and what
you're<00:04:02.359> going<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:02.840> keep<00:04:03.140> mining

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
you're going to do is just keep mining

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.910 
you're going to do is just keep mining
in<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.829> same<00:04:04.070> direction<00:04:04.910> for<00:04:05.510> as<00:04:06.079> long<00:04:06.680> as<00:04:06.799> you

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
in the same direction for as long as you

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.060 
in the same direction for as long as you
want<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.400> light<00:04:08.299> up<00:04:08.420> your<00:04:08.540> way<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.040> what<00:04:10.040> I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
want and light up your way and what I

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.110 
want and light up your way and what I
usually<00:04:10.220> do<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.549> every<00:04:11.890> two<00:04:12.890> blocks<00:04:13.190> like<00:04:14.090> this

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
usually do is every two blocks like this

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.560 
usually do is every two blocks like this
I'll<00:04:14.780> dig<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> little<00:04:15.680> hole<00:04:15.829> like<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:18.099> so<00:04:19.570> now

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
I'll dig a little hole like this so now

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.069 
I'll dig a little hole like this so now
you're<00:04:20.720> going<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.959> be<00:04:21.049> able<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.320> see<00:04:21.530> even

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
you're going to be able to see even

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.740 
you're going to be able to see even
blocks<00:04:22.349> around<00:04:22.590> top<00:04:23.099> bottom<00:04:23.370> below<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.479> and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
blocks around top bottom below you and

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.080 
blocks around top bottom below you and
as<00:04:25.289> you<00:04:25.379> can<00:04:25.500> see<00:04:25.530> we<00:04:25.740> hit<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:25.919> cave<00:04:26.550> right<00:04:26.849> there

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
as you can see we hit a cave right there

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.330 
as you can see we hit a cave right there
some<00:04:27.330> lava<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.710> that's<00:04:28.860> basically<00:04:29.009> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
some lava so that's basically the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.300 
some lava so that's basically the
technique<00:04:29.879> and<00:04:30.530> this<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.680> going<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.919> find<00:04:32.099> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
technique and this is going to find you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.709 
technique and this is going to find you
diamonds<00:04:32.840> fairly<00:04:33.840> easily<00:04:35.449> so<00:04:36.449> I'm<00:04:36.539> going<00:04:36.569> to

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
diamonds fairly easily so I'm going to

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.749 
diamonds fairly easily so I'm going to
do<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:36.930> for<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.199> little<00:04:37.379> bit<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.770> we're<00:04:38.639> going

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
do this for a little bit and we're going

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.129 
do this for a little bit and we're going
to<00:04:38.789> see<00:04:39.000> how<00:04:39.030> much<00:04:39.270> diamonds<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.960> come<00:04:40.110> up

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
to see how much diamonds I can come up

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.980 
to see how much diamonds I can come up
with<00:04:40.409> we<00:04:40.620> already<00:04:40.830> have<00:04:40.949> four<00:04:41.219> so<00:04:42.060> we<00:04:42.689> won't<00:04:42.900> be

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
with we already have four so we won't be

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.140 
with we already have four so we won't be
using<00:04:43.020> those<00:04:43.409> and<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:44.340> recommend<00:04:44.669> setting<00:04:44.939> up

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
using those and I recommend setting up

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.700 
using those and I recommend setting up
like<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.360> storage<00:04:45.780> room<00:04:45.930> around<00:04:46.110> here<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.469> store

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
like a storage room around here to store

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.260 
like a storage room around here to store
your<00:04:46.830> items<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.400> cobblestone<00:04:47.759> that<00:04:48.150> you'll

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
your items and cobblestone that you'll

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.800 
your items and cobblestone that you'll
get<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:49.819> yeah<00:04:50.819> I'm<00:04:50.969> going<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.210> do<00:04:51.449> this<00:04:51.599> for<00:04:51.780> a

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
get so yeah I'm going to do this for a

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.260 
get so yeah I'm going to do this for a
little<00:04:51.930> while<00:04:52.189> expand<00:04:53.189> this<00:04:53.340> out<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.699> see<00:04:53.789> how

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
little while expand this out and see how

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.689 
little while expand this out and see how
many<00:04:54.419> diamonds<00:04:54.509> we<00:04:54.780> get<00:04:55.310> okay<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.370> I've<00:04:56.610> been

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
many diamonds we get okay so I've been

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.670 
many diamonds we get okay so I've been
mining<00:04:57.000> for<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.180> little<00:04:57.330> while<00:04:57.539> now<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.080> I'll

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
been here for about 30-40 minutes mining

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.269 
been here for about 30-40 minutes mining
and<00:05:19.979> we<00:05:20.370> got<00:05:20.520> some<00:05:20.639> emerald<00:05:22.939> iron<00:05:23.939> and<00:05:24.620> yeah<00:05:25.620> I

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.619 
and we got some emerald iron and yeah I
just<00:05:26.460> went<00:05:26.610> down<00:05:26.729> here<00:05:26.909> using<00:05:27.210> my<00:05:27.300> mining

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
just went down here using my mining

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.430 
just went down here using my mining
techniques<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.940> as<00:05:30.779> you<00:05:30.870> can<00:05:30.990> see<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.289> can

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
techniques and as you can see you can

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.899 
techniques and as you can see you can
find<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.740> lot<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:31.889> resources<00:05:32.250> in<00:05:32.580> a<00:05:32.669> short

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
find a lot of resources in a short

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.740 
find a lot of resources in a short
period<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:33.270> time<00:05:33.740> by<00:05:34.740> using<00:05:35.150> this<00:05:36.150> style<00:05:36.599> of

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
period of time by using this style of

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.490 
period of time by using this style of
mining<00:05:37.139> and<00:05:38.300> I<00:05:39.300> also<00:05:39.449> did<00:05:39.690> find<00:05:39.900> some<00:05:40.020> gold<00:05:40.229> and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
mining and I also did find some gold and

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.649 
mining and I also did find some gold and
red<00:05:40.650> stone<00:05:40.919> down<00:05:41.129> here<00:05:41.520> as<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.360> can<00:05:42.419> see<00:05:42.509> I

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
red stone down here as you can see I

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.570 
red stone down here as you can see I
found<00:05:43.080> some<00:05:43.229> redstone<00:05:43.409> so<00:05:43.830> that<00:05:44.039> could<00:05:44.550> be

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
found some redstone so that could be

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.869 
found some redstone so that could be
good<00:05:44.849> too<00:05:45.650> but<00:05:46.650> anyway<00:05:46.889> guys<00:05:47.039> this<00:05:47.460> concludes
