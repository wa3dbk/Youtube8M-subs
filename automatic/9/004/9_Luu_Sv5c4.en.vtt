00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.630 
ton of HP and she hit really hard but
you<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.299> crit<00:02:03.600> her<00:02:03.810> lose<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.680> purpose<00:02:04.710> keep

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you could crit her lose on purpose keep

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
you could crit her lose on purpose keep
the<00:02:05.790> command<00:02:06.090> point<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:07.049> spend<00:02:07.469> another

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the command point and then spend another

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
the command point and then spend another
10<00:02:07.979> energy<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.729> another<00:02:09.030> command<00:02:09.330> point

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
10 energy to get another command point

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
10 energy to get another command point
and<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.020> literally<00:02:10.349> meant<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.129> could<00:02:11.310> have

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and it literally meant you could have

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.430 
and it literally meant you could have
100

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
100

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.350 
100
of<00:02:12.650> command<00:02:12.980> points<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.580> week<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.060> was<00:02:14.150> very

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
of command points in a week it was very

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.390 
of command points in a week it was very
boring<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:15.080> didn't<00:02:15.380> make<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.680> good<00:02:15.830> gameplay

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
boring it didn't make for good gameplay

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.700 
boring it didn't make for good gameplay
and<00:02:16.640> honestly<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.600> probably<00:02:17.660> cut<00:02:18.380> into<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
and honestly it probably cut into the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.190 
and honestly it probably cut into the
profits<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.250> Platon<00:02:19.700> was<00:02:19.820> making<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.360> people

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
profits that Platon was making on people

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.410 
profits that Platon was making on people
buying<00:02:21.590> gold<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.280> spend<00:02:22.550> on<00:02:22.760> command<00:02:23.180> points

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420

to<00:02:23.780> buy<00:02:23.960> characters<00:02:24.560> now<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:24.920> knew<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> player

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
to buy characters now I knew a player

doesn't<00:02:26.000> have<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.300> option<00:02:26.570> unfortunately

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
doesn't have this option unfortunately

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.000

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
but you do have some things you could

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.200 
but you do have some things you could
try<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.280> rely<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.940> daily<00:02:32.090> roulette<00:02:32.570> but

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
try to rely on the daily roulette but

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.150 
try to rely on the daily roulette but
yeah<00:02:35.210> you're<00:02:35.660> oftentimes<00:02:36.350> spending<00:02:36.920> money

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
yeah you're oftentimes spending money

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.870 
yeah you're oftentimes spending money
that<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.000> don't<00:02:38.240> need<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.960> spend<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.880> things

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
that you don't need to spend on things

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.060 
that you don't need to spend on things
that<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:42.080> don't<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.500> want<00:02:43.780> see<00:02:44.780> that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
that you don't really want see that

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.940 
that you don't really want see that
awful<00:02:49.450> four<00:02:50.450> times<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.960> row<00:02:51.110> not<00:02:51.560> worth<00:02:51.770> it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
awful four times in a row not worth it

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.180 
awful four times in a row not worth it
right<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:53.180> what<00:02:54.110> do<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.440> as<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.710> new<00:02:55.040> player

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
right so what do you do as a new player

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.890 
right so what do you do as a new player
I<00:02:55.460> would<00:02:55.730> recommend<00:02:55.850> going<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.510> chapter<00:02:56.870> one

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
I would recommend going to chapter one

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.970 
I would recommend going to chapter one
or<00:02:57.410> chapter<00:02:58.130> 73<00:02:58.990> each<00:02:59.990> of<00:03:00.260> these<00:03:00.380> only<00:03:00.800> has

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
or chapter 73 each of these only has

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.820 
or chapter 73 each of these only has
three<00:03:01.400> missions<00:03:01.820> in<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.180> entire<00:03:02.510> chapter<00:03:03.140> you

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
three missions in the entire chapter you

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.220 
three missions in the entire chapter you
get<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.220> boss<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.730> get<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.210> chance<00:03:05.480> at<00:03:05.720> 13

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
get to the boss you get a chance at 13

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.110 
get to the boss you get a chance at 13
or<00:03:06.380> five<00:03:06.620> command<00:03:07.010> points<00:03:07.250> if<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.820> happen<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
or five command points if you happen to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.050 
or five command points if you happen to
have<00:03:08.180> storm<00:03:08.600> then<00:03:09.260> perhaps<00:03:09.470> chapter<00:03:10.310> 44<00:03:10.820> is

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
have storm then perhaps chapter 44 is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.240 
have storm then perhaps chapter 44 is
more<00:03:11.300> your<00:03:11.450> speed<00:03:11.720> now<00:03:12.320> if<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.800> go<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:12.980> chapter

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
more your speed now if you go to chapter

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.400 
more your speed now if you go to chapter
11<00:03:13.760> or<00:03:13.910> 73<00:03:14.480> you're<00:03:14.930> only<00:03:15.080> going<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.320> be

11 or 73 you're only going to be

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.380 
11 or 73 you're only going to be
spending<00:03:15.620> 30<00:03:16.010> energy<00:03:16.430> which<00:03:16.850> means<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.270> you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
spending 30 energy which means that you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.690 
spending 30 energy which means that you
can<00:03:17.510> spend<00:03:17.989> 60<00:03:18.440> energy<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.280> two<00:03:19.489> chances

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700
