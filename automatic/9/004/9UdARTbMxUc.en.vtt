00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's definitely there sparkplug this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's definitely there sparkplug this
thing<00:01:35.759> produces<00:01:36.600> sparks<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.280> good

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490

and<00:01:38.810> spark<00:01:39.810> plug<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.040> metal<00:01:41.310> tip

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and spark plug you know the metal tip

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.310 
and spark plug you know the metal tip
that's<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.509> gotta<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.840> screw<00:01:43.140> off

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that's on there you gotta like screw off

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.350 
that's on there you gotta like screw off
because<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.399> um<00:01:44.640> I'll<00:01:45.570> show<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.080 

see<00:01:49.930> that<00:01:50.140> that's<00:01:50.830> not<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.430> metal<00:01:51.760> tip<00:01:51.910> on

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
see that that's not the metal tip on

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.580 
see that that's not the metal tip on
there<00:01:52.270> because<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.720> doesn't<00:01:52.990> fit<00:01:53.230> in<00:01:53.410> there

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
there because it doesn't fit in there

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
there because it doesn't fit in there
but<00:01:54.040> when<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.760> take<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.060> off<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.420> does<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.610> um

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
but when you take it off it does and um

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.830 
but when you take it off it does and um
put<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.990> gas<00:01:59.140> tank<00:01:59.170> back<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.800> reconnected<00:02:00.520> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
put the gas tank back on reconnected it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.660 
put the gas tank back on reconnected it
down<00:02:02.940> there<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.800> I<00:02:05.800> still<00:02:06.100> got<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.370> clean<00:02:06.460> the
