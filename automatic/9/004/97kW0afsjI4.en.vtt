 Hello 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.449
 in this city all this we will consider the option 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.820
 create a logo using 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.599
 cash 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.789
 let it be the first option 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.079
 pick up the test mode 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.569
 type the words 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 logo 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.300
 in this case, I 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.749
 ohh choice turn back pact 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.890
 insofar as 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.360
 I like his angularity 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.520
 fourth model seat 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.190
 let's try to beat it in our 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.610
 option 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.890
 the first thing we reduce 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.950
 he is in curve mode 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 click site 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.030
 Craig Sponsors 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.340
 I'm after all, the transition to the regime led to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.719
 keyboard press control and flu 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.900
 we have 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.630
 abakumov chemists culture means this 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.480
 already mode 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 next move choose a frame 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 without straight lines with rounded corners 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 conditionally 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.189
 Here's a frame retractable fill 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.330
 assign contour 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030
 black 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.550
 thickness 2 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.870
 I let's try it connects black 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.570
 cloud tall self taught how are you them 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.980
 beat 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.080
 idea came it's time when bright 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.909
 viewed etc 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 these contests are now 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.020
 but I wanted it from him 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.530
 some continuation of districts is gone 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.990
 hockey dealers then 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.430
 to the right we shall look into which of this 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.880
 can happen 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.370
 until something like something set 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.950
 this is our frame 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.790
 a little bit and her 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.360
 increased 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.800
 here 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 what is it like i need 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.170
 man step story typo he too 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.930
 turning our frame even into 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 social this object as if in curves 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.399
 click on the three countries 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.889
 gm so that the ticks stand in peak complicating 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.720
 here are his words wits 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 tube contour respectively 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.899
 percent 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.589
 in paris directly 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.589
 check that we have everything ok 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.359
 euro further rubles to get a drawing 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.299
 on a wide range will not change 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.959
 work Cherkasy 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.339
 dots 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.099
 I will highlight the matter in this analyst 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.569
 right points 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.909
 they became September 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.680
 clicking on one of them the experience of this miner 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.409
 started to drive drag off 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.469
 something like this 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.419
 that is, paradise point so we will 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.739
 to put 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.739
 some way this way 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.359
 it's higher 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.069
 but then we 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.059
 girlfriend actor 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.279
 slightly increase the image to 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.279
 better than you could see 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.379
 go to fault mode 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.089
 our next steps 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.819
 it's us here 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.369
 from our frame 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.870
 as they say we remove the extra 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.629
 a segment here we would be pleased here 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.429
 we don't need a frame 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.969
 received object 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.889
 let's go to normal 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.969
 let's get everything clear what's the matter 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.709
 to the question who is he to some 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.999
 rectangle 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.969
 which is allocated together with our 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.239
 frame 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.209
 and continue to choose a vacation and social in 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.960
 attack 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.139
 mode 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.889
 we got that at the intersection 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.519
 rectangle and our omichki 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.429
 but it turned out difficult articles 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.319
 magnetka now we are disassembling them by the wheel 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.829
 I pressed a button 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.229
 the right mouse button opened the window 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.709
 in which he chose anna pear 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.299
 and now Russia and we do not need 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.299
 elements of the resulting group 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.729
 like this 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.719
 what are our next steps 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.539
 which means the whole to trim the young man 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.830
 Lorient points and to the bank 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.669
 generally 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.029
 m in particular so that they 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.110
 gives smoothly were neat to each other 

00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:31.270
 were leaving 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.469
 for this 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.319
 we increase the area to scale 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.599
 goes into approx mode 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.300
 at the same time we see that we have 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 not deleted is still 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.379
 I offer percent 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.489
 lift just a little bit worse 

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.180
 for hippie cleaning 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.550
 so they become one tour and venezuela 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.970
 our frame and now 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.270
 combining rest 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.270
 like this 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.860
 we see that we have turned out here 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.259
 quite neat 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.430
 mates 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.430
 It is done 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.439
 press several times she kontron minus 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.050
 thereby you will be prevented scale 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.120
 image to of course 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.270
 the resulting leaks watched sicily 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.090
 the first part is basically less 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.090
 already satisfied 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.300
 what do you want herzen 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.020
 little box 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.870
 two nights 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.669
 right i thought thats this way 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.409
 can do 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.610
 It now remains to finalize the right 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.639
 part of our logo 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.129
 what i have 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:50.610
 since the beginning of May 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.240
 take two extreme late 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.330
 just them 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.559
 when the money was not a little bit to the right 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.999
 and for what 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.169
 also the right side of our frame 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.950
 select mode pay attention 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.030
 not in the main thing but in the mode of operation 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.080
 lines 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.050
 what we see is that we have everything 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.130
 economically 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.569
 but if we are not only 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.439
 square 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.389
 right points 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.330
 click on the oncoming keyboard 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.499
 neatly 2 1 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.639
 like bukovsky 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.479
 but let's say 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.479
 in this way we got trouble 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.889
 ao logo 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.370
 with the use of Miranovich kiosks 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.810
 using left and right symmetric 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.730
 semicircular 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.340
 which will open 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.340
 neatly fit 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.680
 logo balance inscriptions made 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.279
 font import 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.719
 and it was that idea which is bright and in 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:54.879
 in this case he wanted 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:56.899
 illustrate interest on 

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:59.759
 the next lesson I will talk about one more 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.730
 opportunities 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.539
 to create a logo using points 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.080
 goodbye for now thank you for your attention
