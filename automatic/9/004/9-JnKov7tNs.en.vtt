00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello hello my charming food 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.220
 there is very very glad to see you all and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 Now again, mine continues 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.440
 long santa barbara about blank 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 jars and this time we're over 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.870
 a lot of pencils that's just a lot 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.289
 many many pencils didn't end 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.520
 even if he once bought a pencil 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.150
 it ended up probably it was good 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.769
 and then all at once they were already good 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 received helped some over many years 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.150
 Were generally received on what we 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
 probably from pencils 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.329
 are two such events on a pencil 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.250
 they were pencils Kayala one I 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.570
 The numbers here are also no longer visible 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.550
 here are some stubs 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 absolutely without numbers and without anything 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 beads was so dull and so 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 purple pencil too it is 305 too 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.579
 down below I'll write this lucky this yet 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.090
 where is it preserved in general enough 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 quite good pencil and at first were not 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 dryish but then how are you getting closer 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.170
 by the middle they became such fatter 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.180
 softer probably not a bit there tips 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.040
 dried up in general, cool then them 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.960
 very I loved it possible forces on 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.790
 selected line and on the lower eyelid 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.020
 arrows they had to draw of course 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 too uncomfortable even 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.630
 soft then the next two pencils are 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.700
 Emily somehow brought help to Turkey 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 a whole bunch of pencils for one dollar 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 these are the stories of the series you are still left 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.159
 probably a bunch of the same 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.369
 from one here in the middle fell slate 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.580
 and blue you 2 what frost in this 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.710
 matt such 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.890
 and royal up let's say blue and this one 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.290
 such more 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.870
 is a frost you shine with a pencil and here 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.640
 this is the most fashionable blue autumn in 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.150
 In general, they tinted them, I brought them 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.170
 almost completely these two pencils 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.610
 here is then over pencil 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.120
 brown from is a door it was a pencil 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.640

 very nice soft just thats chic 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.640
 matte black black dark brown 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.090
 pencil 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.120
 I really, really loved it, too, in his 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.920
 mainly on forces on one line and 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.920
 arrows, in principle, could also 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 draw some no room here, too, the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.560
 erased but in general I will write below 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.570
 ended the black pencil it was 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.000
 miniature from lancome deal for a long time 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.220
 long pascal everywhere with me i already have 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.550
 too long ago apparently lingering in general that 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.650
 he is so much harder here two melted one 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.440
 estee lauder is also a miniature and the second 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.570
 Narkomovsky in general lancome he such 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.100
 a little harder you wore too 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.560
 water line a little to them there 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.510
 periodically drew arrows enough 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.970
 was very good in principle not 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.980
 smeared those days nothing 's mine 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.380
 Kaya favorite estee lauder thumbnail 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.180
 ended there is still such a big general 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.190
 it is already even with a lid or get it 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.130
 flew away in general pencil cool 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.440
 matt bold good is it in place 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.300
 waterproof principle i him or there 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.430
 wore his family wore and wore winter 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.350
 superski pencil on the water line he 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.410
 Keeps at all as nailed not erased 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.690
 practically nothing but a means 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.709
 for makeup removal so this one here 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.830
 estee lauder the coolest pencil 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.220
 I still ended up with a make up this 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.920
 0 9 was so chic 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.950
 mounting ivory and basically 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.870
 I like it very much in spring and in summer it is beautiful 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.300
 looks on the water is not refreshing cool 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.580
 you can look under the brow can 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.160
 corner can be shaded as a base under 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.960
 shade it on the whole eyelid cause general 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.980
 here is a stub from him too 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.630
 there is such I have 2's cool 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.760
 good pencil then two ended 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.490
 carcasses and here they are absolutely gold 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.530
 Absolutely budget carcasses cool on 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.470
 in fact, the colors give them very well 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.080
 lengths of course from them and the volume a little but 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.820
 color gives them really cool 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.550
 here is blue mascara I sat down again 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.920
 on top of black mascara to be this 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.640
 a little peacock feather effect and 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.670
 down below 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.770
 straight all the way to the lower eyelashes 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.770
 force blue and that's so black 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.359
 blue up brushes they have here such 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.669
 combs in principle very much even once 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.669
 they divide well we are all little by little 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.090
 Harsh how much they cost principle 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.220
 you can bear anything terrible mascara 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.200
 actually very good and not 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.540
 showered nothing this mascara eggplant such 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.550
 cool too on the legendary from for sure 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.890
 on the internet mind creepy 2 or 3 0 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.840
 ends exactly as it seems 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.660
 seems to be brown brown but on 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.190
 the sun can be seen there so shallow-shallow 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.290
 purple gold and mother of pearl 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.810
 amazing mascara is also very beautiful 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.000
 looks and but the effect is again from her 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.190
 there is no just good colors i 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.840
 beautiful again either black or dark 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.300
 brown is completely fine so thick 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.420
 upper lashes and top pass then 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.000
 But this ink is lower and completely 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.680
 it looks very good even my 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.310
 eyebrow gel is the most 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.970
 budget reluy again very quickly 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.230
 ends but worth a penny therefore 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.960
 he is beautiful enough 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.160
 comfortable brush them then 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.780
 left me for some reason the most 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.450
 more convenient to use here such 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:27.700
 how ordinary mascara ended two such 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.280
 shimmer shiny eyeliners too 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.730
 enough budget and 1 golden rose 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.570
 0 1 and 2 the same 02 one such 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.770
 green 2 white white with white 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.360
 brilliance this month on the eyes and 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.030
 The last time I made up she already 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.250
 more everything is already blown away in general 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.950
 liner is also quite good and their 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.920
 combining or doing a double arrow 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.920
 black with color or sola wide 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.270
 the arrows in general, they will be amazing 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.330
 completely despite the fact that again 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.490
 worth doing why practically not 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.680
 worth a nice cool liner so y 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.480
 they are not even erased no caps nothing 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.400
 and men of the year from the basement. 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.810
 there are no scratches they look 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.640
 decent enough for such a budget 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.280
 makeup and base over under the shade 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.040
 my favorite is my second ending 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.680
 The base from the same manufacturer is 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.530
 I have vivienne sabo here it is 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.020
 stayed a couple of times it could be on 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.300
 a couple of weeks will still stretch the base 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.090
 such an unpredictable product 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.250
 when it wants to wear then it will end 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.360
 my favorite replacement is not holding 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.580
 everything is absolutely 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.430
 even the cheapest products on 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.320
 they sit very very decent and 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.300
 cream shadows and pigment and in general all 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.030
 everything is all all in a row base is cool working 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.670
 so I have 2 more so in stock 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.130
 if anything, it was all mine 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.810
 empty jars but of course not everything is so 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.810
 that all love all the numbers all bye for now
