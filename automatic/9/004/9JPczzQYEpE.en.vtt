00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.100
 hello everyone today i want 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.470
 show you tell rather how I 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.290
 tied such a wonderful winter 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:17.570
 blouse she's pretty tight 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.739
 that is a blouse will be very warm 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:30.559
 I used 70 percent thread here 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:34.660
 wool baby strings and tune 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:42.040
 such a motive is used by me 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.040
 take away the collar and here is not among the blouses 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:52.310
 so here is the tune I was knitting 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.060
 Separately, I give you the previous video 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.530
 told how to tie such a tune 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:06.829
 on a blouse I knit this principle like 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:12.189
 and a children's sweater that is also 70 g 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:15.189
 air dive did not gain only immediately 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.189
 here 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:28.970
 I wonâ€™t be here right away 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:34.329
 I divided it into four parts and started 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:41.030
 knit here as you see as shovchiki 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:44.200
 that is, shell rock, we immediately I that is, in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.140
 one loop here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.420
 knit a loop of air loop and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.720
 loop again and continued to knit 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:03.200
 have us knitting need to divide by 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:06.649
 four pieces fix the loop to me there 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.920
 14 was sleeves here by fourteen 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:17.900
 loops here here is the front and the back was on 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 28 loops these that is between where they 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.010
 pass the line the world between the eyelets 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.350
 between 14 and 28 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.900
 we are tying here such a connector 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.230
 me 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 shovchiki sleeves 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.480
 I ended up knitting in the same way 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 version kurt just tight knit then 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.290
 have collected a hook 2 number and knit 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 it turns out such a dense twig 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:56.530
 how separately motives are tied up 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.530
 hook me now 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:09.680
 you can tie it sew and needles 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.680
 whatever you want 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.380
 take back here here stitched a 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.170
 here already 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.060
 typed those loops that is here 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
 I must have a certain amount of it 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.780
 the number of loops that is the same as 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.850
 on top and I and them already so connected 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.430
 that I had the same amount 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:40.280
 loops you can sew all the needle 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.820
 tune so that it was easier then the loops 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.690
 you count 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:51.010
 buns sewn too 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:56.720
 so here is such a jacket 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.470
