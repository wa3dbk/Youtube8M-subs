00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 john karelse and three a win 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.819
 their u pull through is joy i can 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.730
 propose 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.550
 but perhaps also in the relief 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 yes both one but I also have a problem 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.280
 enjoyed must take care of second half 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.160
 I thought this was one of them 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.539
 our varieties was half of season 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.460
 this we think the ribbon to have 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.020
 We clearly have more chances to win 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.029
 turned and utrecht the recovery was the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.350
 first half hour was not really good 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.210
 yes I think the second one just had 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 clearly the better team and we have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.199
 a few more chances given away the error 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.790
 unsure of my eye in the but me 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.280
 I say we think so much better 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 the two that fits in with a lot more 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.559
 opportunity created in the end 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 help in an away game 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.800
 so I think it's pretty thereby 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.760
 show it is not your no let 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 see today 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.230
 shots resources within that yes 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
 lovely in I think quick free kick and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 who tried himself one and I tried it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 even though it was a bit agreed and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 yes grab the ball and take your caps quickly 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.449
 husband of her 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.680
 yes i t it was delicious in me 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.969
 took it honestly and you can feel it already 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.690
 that they are in it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.840
 I added them extra and two hours one hour two 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 lower official game of day 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.299
 concluded with a take a win 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.860
 but certainly also a very important one 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.180
 victory 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.650
 yes a good win I think because 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.820
 Sure look with three more before it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.030
 this was only to go after 3 games 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.970
 six points for VVV is one all 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.110
 a zero behind and to you belong on it 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.110
 plate 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.460
 do you see that two stands for VVV then yes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.420
 then I think if it wasn't there 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.920
 to be 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 I just really think a very good one 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 to have played the second and the one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 3 within her then and you do 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.939
 We had to win a 3 match 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 utrecht 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.299
 and then yes now it is ready now you are 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.540
 safe 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.659
 yes or vvv must win and then also with 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.759
 1505 theo from 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.369
 ajax and twente win but I'm going now 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.390
 I'm not going to believe he basically with you 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.390
 it safe so fortunately
