00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.790
 how about youtube friends i am your king 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.090
 Mass and today I bring you a new 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.950
 video tutorial in which I show you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.800
 how to have this infinite red order in 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 god of war 1 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.600
 this center cabbages 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.870
 Well, we could not call it a trick because 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.010
 itself is a mistake of the game 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.160
 but in itself this error is of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 It's very good and right now it's going to 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.879
 teach how to do 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.870
 in my previous videos if you look at them 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.300
 go directly to my channel you will find 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.379
 with 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.579
 things 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.390
 like infinite magic how to get it 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.390
 is in my videos 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.520
 go to my channel subscribe if 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 and so 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 let's see what happens 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.380
 okay 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.060
 at this moment we are in it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.060
 in the temple of pandora 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.300
 we are seeing at the moment by the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.300
 Pandora's box 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.170
 good 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.120
 first of all if we are playing the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.090
 easy way 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.280
 the trick 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.050
 for the trick you need not to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.220
 let's have the swords 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.220
 above level 2 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.070
 I recommend you leave them at level 1 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.790
 because as you may realize in mode 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.790
 easy after 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.350
 sub with a hit you could kill the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.680
 beast is that we need to give several 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.450
 hits and josh and then it would not work in mode 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.840
 normal like this it is necessary that 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.980
 our countries have levels of 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.209
 less than 2 and in difficult mode or not 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.739
 Spartan 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.470
 it is necessary that our 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.470
 spaces are not above level 2 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.530
 what do we have to do? 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.530
 we stop here in this part 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 we are to be this massive thing ok 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.590
 it's coming here 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.130
 We turn around and wait for 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.690
 that the bird returns 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.690
 what do we have to do here 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.740
 when the bird hits us we press 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.220
 picture box triangle to make the 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.319
 combo 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.109
 and immediately we go up the stairs 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.069
 Once there the bird will bounce bounces 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:13.189
 to bounce and then in the game depending 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.430
 of the number of blows are the orbs that 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.200
 they give you with many of the monsters they 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.870
 they have realized that if they give more hits 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.599
 they still do not give them more orbs this is why 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.470
 every monster has a determination of 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.690
 of orbs that gives 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.620
 and then if they are given more hits or 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.860
 they give us more orbs and then that's why in 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.290
 some give us more others give us less 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.650
 here we will learn how to get him out 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.770
 all the orders are already in the bird 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.010
 okay 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.010
 there is 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.069
 ok there they have it 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.719
 and so 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.150
 the bird is going to stay there 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.150
 hitting is suffering 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.409
 Well, we can do this as many times as 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.950
 we want and increase our weapons to 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.950
 maximum 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.319
 that is, you must have plans for 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.620
 your weapons of this type is there is the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.620
 video 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.159
 and so it's going to continue until 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.750
 Let's arrive until our orbs are 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.750
 at level 99 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.199
 It is fair to say that this is too easy 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.719
 but this will cost some of them 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.800
 work do not worry at all 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:48.220
 games works including those of pc 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.960
 this is a very easy trick and I say no 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.120
 we could call it a trick because in itself 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.909
 this is a game error only 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.000
 we use this because its faults for 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.440
 generate the trick this one I do not like 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.530
 a lot to call it a trick but things and 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.530
 then they are called this well then it is already 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.430
 to this one 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.330
 there they have it and then any doubt 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.330
 can comment 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.289
 comment subscribe any question 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.289
 comment and clarified 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.050
 and your review is dismissed
