my<00:01:11.390> main<00:01:11.600> reasoning<00:01:12.049> for<00:01:12.229> this<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:14.659> to<00:01:14.990> show

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
my main reasoning for this is to show

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.980 
my main reasoning for this is to show
you<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.590> interface<00:01:15.890> lag<00:01:16.369> between<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.569> Xbox

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
you the interface lag between the Xbox

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.319 
you the interface lag between the Xbox
one<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.710> PlayStation<00:01:19.009> 4<00:01:20.439> stop<00:01:21.439> listening

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
one and the PlayStation 4 stop listening

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.660 
one and the PlayStation 4 stop listening
all<00:01:23.329> right<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:23.869> we<00:01:24.289> have<00:01:24.439> titanfall<00:01:24.920> here<00:01:25.399> I'm
