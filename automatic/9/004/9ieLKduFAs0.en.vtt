00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 we would just stop taking reviews 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.590
 if in our top extreme games not 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.660
 would this game be our favorite 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.470
 stickman base jumper 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.580
 This is a super series of games in general from the series. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 games and ths 90s of the gene of the pancake is a vegetable 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.369
 great series of games but stickman base 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 jumper is generally my favorite game among 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.830
 stick man of because here he is very 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.460
 cool behaves and very cool break 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 you must have time to open the parachute if 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.489
 you open the parachute in time 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.260

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.829
 specialized area in which you 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.970

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 but here's a stunning radar 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.950
 part-time is and very cool 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.260
 game about extreme sports 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.930
 why is it a sport because you need a lot 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.410
 good at running and doing different 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.870
 tricks as well as swim jump and 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.070
 dodge bears to save 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.070
 your ass from this plush 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.070
 creatures in general as usual in all 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.070
 numbers you have to run and jump 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.990
 ride a pope dodge various 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.780
 obstacles but beyond that even 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.180
 swim and parachute 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.500
 so let me try take away 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.450
 the moment where you have to change your 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.150
 opinion about radar 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.790
 in a positive way I hope I will have time 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.420
 Reach up to this point and not worried 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.730
 I now run as I can try and come on 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.010
 faster man rubber time 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.260
 people you already want to see many in 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.080

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.580
 You see what the bear is on the island 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.700
 trying to hurt us with a paw but he doesnâ€™t 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.830
 it will turn out because we have from and here 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.989
 actually we drove the puffy down 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.840
 rolling down somewhere incomprehensible 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.280
 unknown distance and again we are with that 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.590
 remember what you gonna do i want 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.239
