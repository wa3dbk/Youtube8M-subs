00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.679
 between those of the defendant 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.960
 among animals 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 yesterday to aeronautics 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.499
 On the same line 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.029
 better not 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.339
 it goes beyond 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.339
 she was delegated 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.560
 she deserved to win 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.110
 beyond nuclear weapons 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.110

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.190
 vice 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.589
 This can do 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:17.999
 - everytime 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.069
 how old 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 Twice and nothing ever happened 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.359
 by the end of August 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.439
