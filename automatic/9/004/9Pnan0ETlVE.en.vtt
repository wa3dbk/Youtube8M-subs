 "Endotoxemia of dead meat from meat" 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.409
 These findings on inflammatory compounds 

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:08.509
 in animal and fermented foods 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.312
 "... therefore they suggest that even at first glance, food that is unspoiled 

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:12.942
 they can at some point 

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:15.317
 preparation or processing 

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:16.767
 contain microbial loads 

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.847
 which is sufficient to release endotoxin receptor stimulants 

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.988
 into the environment in which the bacteria grow. " 

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.666
 This idea is supported by many previous studies, 

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.426
 that show that some commonly consumed 

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.713
 foods can contain large amounts of bacteria before cooking. 

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:30.773
 For example, fresh meat on a hamburger. 

00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:32.473
 With him, 

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.654
 that contains about 100 million bacteria per serving of 110 grams. 

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:39.832
 However, the main objective of this study was not 

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:42.942
 examine the microbial quality of each food tested, 

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.981
 because the pathogenic molecular formula, biological activity, 

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.771
 it is maintained independently 

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.373
 the viability of the bacterium or the heat treatment of the food. 

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:54.293
 This means that bacteria can be dead, 

00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:55.813
 they can be cooked 

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:58.539
 but their endotoxins remain in the food. 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.769
 You can cook meat for two hours, 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.889
 immerse him in an acid bath (like our stomach) 

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.467
 and expose it to digestive enzymes. 

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.103
 It was found that bacterial endotoxins survived as cooking, 

00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:16.473
 So all the efforts of our stomach acid and digestive enzymes. 

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:18.333
 This led researchers to speculate, 

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.713
 that "occasional ingestion of foods high in bacterial endotoxins 

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:25.295
 could promote transient, mild and systemic inflammatory episodes, 

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.885
 which predispose individuals to development 

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.515
 atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, 

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.254
 which in turn can lead to diabetes. " 

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:36.041
 Animal fat can play an important role 

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.681
 in the pathogenesis of post-meal inflammation by 

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.301
 that will increase the absorption of endotoxins. 

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.654
 This is where animal fat fits into a puzzle. 

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:48.513
 Endotoxin binds strongly to saturated fat and its transport system 

00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:51.118
 along with it penetrates through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream. 

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:54.108
 So animal fat can play a role 

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:56.091
 in increasing endotoxin absorption. 

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.224
 However, the main reason why all these 

00:01:58.224 --> 00:01:59.394
 studies show an increase in inflammation 

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:02.554
 after eating animal foods, but for the vast majority of plant, 

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.877
 there may be a bacterial burden on dead bacteria from animal products. 

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.982
 These release endotoxins that are subsequently absorbed into the blood, 

00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:12.492
 leading to endotoxic inflammation, 

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:18.842
 what we see after eating meat, eggs and dairy products. 

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.712
 So when we know what's going on, 

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:24.058
 what do we do with it now? 

00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:26.528
 (Excerpt from follow-up 2010 study.) 

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:31.018
 The clearest solution to this metabolic endotoxemia 

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:33.785
 it will obviously reduce saturated fat intake, 

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.565
 which mainly comes from cheese and chicken in the American diet. 

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:38.972
 However, researchers are worried 

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:42.182
 â€œThat the Western diet is not such a step 

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:47.606
 and it may be difficult for patients to meet this requirement. "
