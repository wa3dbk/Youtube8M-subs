I picked this filter up today from Petco
for<00:00:09.030> about<00:00:09.440> 15<00:00:10.440> bucks<00:00:10.940> to<00:00:11.940> use<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.420> small

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
for about 15 bucks to use in my small

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.240 
for about 15 bucks to use in my small
2.5<00:00:13.710> gallon<00:00:14.210> mini<00:00:15.210> bow<00:00:15.360> tank<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> filter

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
2.5 gallon mini bow tank the filter

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.300 
2.5 gallon mini bow tank the filter
there<00:00:18.410> wasn't<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.439> good<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.980> blocks<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
there wasn't very good and it blocks a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.470 
there wasn't very good and it blocks a
lot<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> light<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.119> looking<00:00:21.210> for

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
lot of light so I was looking for

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.450 
lot of light so I was looking for
something<00:00:21.720> different

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
something different

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
something different
so<00:00:23.460> anyway<00:00:23.699> I'll<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> quick<00:00:25.080> look<00:00:25.320> at

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so anyway I'll just do a quick look at

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.509 
so anyway I'll just do a quick look at
this<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.660> then<00:00:28.230> after<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.590> I'll<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
this and and then after this I'll get it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.710 
this and and then after this I'll get it
set<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> tank<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> show<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> what

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
set up in the tank and show you what

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.790 
set up in the tank and show you what
that<00:00:30.750> looks<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:33.380> basically<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that looks like so basically what you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.209 
that looks like so basically what you
get<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> box<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.430> this

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.440 

it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> conventional<00:00:41.820> hanging<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> back

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's a conventional hanging off the back

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:53.050 
it's a conventional hanging off the back
style<00:00:42.750> filter<00:00:43.789> uses<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.719> pads

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.870 

a<00:00:53.620> few<00:00:54.620> extra<00:00:54.890> parts<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.370> they<00:00:55.490> stick<00:00:55.730> in

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
a few extra parts that they stick in

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:09.700 
a few extra parts that they stick in
here<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:05.360> there's<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.570> look<00:01:05.750> inside<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.960> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
here so there's a look inside and the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.040 
here so there's a look inside and the
pump<00:01:10.400> assembly<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.910> removable<00:01:13.690> just<00:01:14.690> twist<00:01:14.960> it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
pump assembly is removable just twist it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.150 
pump assembly is removable just twist it
like<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:17.270> pulls<00:01:17.480> out<00:01:17.660> so<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.620> can<00:01:18.770> clean

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
like that it pulls out so you can clean

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:32.130 
like that it pulls out so you can clean
the<00:01:19.280> impeller

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.530 

and<00:01:32.740> nice<00:01:33.280> thing<00:01:33.490> about<00:01:33.550> this<00:01:33.760> filter<00:01:34.180> which

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
and nice thing about this filter which

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.820 
and nice thing about this filter which
you<00:01:34.630> don't<00:01:34.780> see<00:01:34.900> on<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.020> lot<00:01:35.050> of<00:01:35.170> small<00:01:35.470> filters

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
you don't see on a lot of small filters

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.210 
you don't see on a lot of small filters
is<00:01:36.040> that<00:01:36.070> has<00:01:36.880> adjustable<00:01:37.480> flow<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:39.040> if<00:01:39.100> you're

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
is that has adjustable flow so if you're

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.400 
is that has adjustable flow so if you're
using<00:01:39.370> it<00:01:39.580> for<00:01:39.760> something<00:01:39.910> like<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.150> beta<00:01:40.420> you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
using it for something like a beta you

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.910 
using it for something like a beta you
know<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.650> small<00:01:41.890> tank<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.560> can<00:01:44.650> turn<00:01:44.800> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
know in a small tank you can turn the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.380 
know in a small tank you can turn the
flow<00:01:45.100> down<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.550> doesn't<00:01:45.820> have<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.240> bother

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
flow down so it doesn't have to bother

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:57.210 
flow down so it doesn't have to bother
the<00:01:46.660> fish<00:01:46.810> at<00:01:46.960> all<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:56.979> thing<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.190> noticed

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
the fish at all and one thing I noticed

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.690 
the fish at all and one thing I noticed
about<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:59.440> plastic<00:01:59.650> is<00:02:00.280> pretty

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
about this the the plastic is pretty

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.330 
about this the the plastic is pretty
thick<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.180> feels<00:02:01.360> really<00:02:01.660> sturdy<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
thick and it feels really sturdy so

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.260 
thick and it feels really sturdy so
overall<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.760> feels<00:02:03.790> really<00:02:04.150> high-quality<00:02:09.270> I'm

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
overall it feels really high-quality I'm

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.010 
overall it feels really high-quality I'm
not<00:02:10.450> sure<00:02:10.600> what<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.869> piece<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.350> for<00:02:13.020> it's

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
not sure what this piece is for it's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.860 
not sure what this piece is for it's
just<00:02:14.200> like<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> small<00:02:15.360> feels<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.510> cotton

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.120 

maybe<00:02:21.440> some<00:02:21.650> type<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.860> pre-filter<00:02:24.130> something

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
maybe some type of pre-filter something

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.120 
maybe some type of pre-filter something
like<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.400> I'm<00:02:25.520> not<00:02:25.610> really<00:02:25.730> sure<00:02:27.130> these

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
like that I'm not really sure these

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.470 
like that I'm not really sure these
filters<00:02:28.459> are<00:02:28.520> pretty<00:02:28.730> cheap<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.209> saw

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
filters are pretty cheap I saw

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.729 
filters are pretty cheap I saw
replacements<00:02:30.080> at<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> store<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.500> think

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
replacements at the store I think

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.280 
replacements at the store I think
there's<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.010> pack<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.220> four<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.670> them<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
there's a pack of four of them for the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.589 
there's a pack of four of them for the
the<00:02:34.130> coarser<00:02:34.520> sponge<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.390> finer

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
the coarser sponge and for the finer

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.910 
the coarser sponge and for the finer
sponge<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.110> was<00:02:36.290> only<00:02:36.410> four<00:02:36.680> bucks<00:02:38.739> one<00:02:39.739> thing

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
sponge it was only four bucks one thing

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.720 
sponge it was only four bucks one thing
that<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.130> doesn't<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:42.730> chemical

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
that this doesn't have is a chemical

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.360 
that this doesn't have is a chemical
filtration<00:02:44.090> system<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.130> plan<00:02:46.340> on

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
filtration system so I just plan on

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.220 
filtration system so I just plan on
putting<00:02:46.640> some<00:02:46.910> carbon<00:02:47.300> pellets<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.560> back

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
putting some carbon pellets in the back

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.190 
putting some carbon pellets in the back
so<00:02:51.230> pretty<00:02:51.620> easy<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.690> then<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.810> get<00:02:53.959> two

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
so pretty easy and then you get two

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.470 
so pretty easy and then you get two
extension<00:02:54.739> tubes<00:02:58.060> hold<00:02:59.060> one<00:02:59.180> that's<00:02:59.330> already

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
extension tubes hold one that's already

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.880 
extension tubes hold one that's already
on<00:02:59.690> there<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.049> can<00:03:00.140> put<00:03:00.319> another<00:03:00.500> extension

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
on there you can put another extension

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.520 
on there you can put another extension
on<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.340> then<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.519> get<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:03.140> end<00:03:03.260> piece

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
on and then you get the the end piece

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.250 
on and then you get the the end piece
and<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:05.269> also<00:03:05.420> came<00:03:05.750> with<00:03:06.080> this<00:03:06.739> thing<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.690> I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
and it also came with this thing and I

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.380 
and it also came with this thing and I
cannot<00:03:09.530> figure<00:03:09.739> out<00:03:09.830> what<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.099> is<00:03:10.220> if<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.239> have

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
cannot figure out what it is if you have

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.940 
cannot figure out what it is if you have
an<00:03:11.480> idea<00:03:11.630> if<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.019> know<00:03:12.080> what<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.380> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
an idea if you know what this is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.750 
an idea if you know what this is
go<00:03:13.280> ahead<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.549> post<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.819> in<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.000> comments<00:03:15.760> so

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
go ahead and post it in the comments so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.339 
go ahead and post it in the comments so
that's<00:03:16.940> all<00:03:17.060> for<00:03:17.180> now<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:17.780> I'll<00:03:18.230> get

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
that's all for now and then I'll get

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.630 
that's all for now and then I'll get
this<00:03:18.470> set<00:03:18.680> up<00:03:18.769> in<00:03:18.860> my<00:03:18.980> small<00:03:19.160> tank<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.549> we'll

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
this set up in my small tank and we'll

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.750 
this set up in my small tank and we'll
take<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.819> look<00:03:20.030> at<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.239> there

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
take a look at it there

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.080 
take a look at it there
all<00:03:22.760> right<00:03:22.940> here's<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.840> Red<00:03:24.410> Sea<00:03:25.090> DecoArt

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.170 

as<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.960> can<00:03:45.050> see<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.380> really<00:03:45.560> quiet<00:03:46.180> I'm

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
as you can see it's really quiet I'm

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.290 
as you can see it's really quiet I'm
actually<00:03:47.420> noticed<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:49.000> putting<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.030> lid<00:03:50.270> on

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
actually noticed that putting the lid on

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.470 
actually noticed that putting the lid on
makes<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.960> a<00:03:50.990> little<00:03:51.080> bit<00:03:51.260> noisier<00:03:55.390> if<00:03:56.390> you

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
makes it a little bit noisier if you

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.860 
makes it a little bit noisier if you
take<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.810> off<00:03:56.930> there's<00:03:57.200> barely<00:03:57.800> any<00:03:58.040> noise<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
take it off there's barely any noise and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
take it off there's barely any noise and
I<00:04:02.990> don't<00:04:03.080> know<00:04:03.200> if<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.320> microphone<00:04:03.710> will<00:04:03.860> pick

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
I don't know if a microphone will pick

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.140 
I don't know if a microphone will pick
it<00:04:04.070> up<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.280> as<00:04:04.400> soon<00:04:04.550> as<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.700> put<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:04.970> lid<00:04:05.120> on

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
it up but as soon as you put the lid on

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.040 
it up but as soon as you put the lid on
it<00:04:07.210> makes<00:04:08.210> a<00:04:08.270> little<00:04:08.450> bit<00:04:08.570> more<00:04:08.720> noise<00:04:08.900> and

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
it makes a little bit more noise and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.470 
it makes a little bit more noise and
it's<00:04:09.320> not<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.280> vibration<00:04:10.730> or<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.060> rattle<00:04:11.360> or

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
it's not like a vibration or a rattle or

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.380 
it's not like a vibration or a rattle or
anything<00:04:11.690> it's<00:04:11.960> just<00:04:12.020> that<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.910> humming<00:04:14.240> from

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
anything it's just that the humming from

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.050 
anything it's just that the humming from
the<00:04:14.540> motor<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:16.070> kind<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.340> amplified<00:04:16.820> by<00:04:17.000> this

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
the motor is kind of amplified by this

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.370 
the motor is kind of amplified by this
big<00:04:17.630> plastic<00:04:17.870> surface<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:21.019> definitely<00:04:21.320> not

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
big plastic surface it's definitely not

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.660 
big plastic surface it's definitely not
annoying<00:04:21.650> or<00:04:21.830> anything<00:04:21.950> like<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.190> it's<00:04:22.490> not

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
annoying or anything like that it's not

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.939 
annoying or anything like that it's not
obtrusive<00:04:22.880> but<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:24.710> does<00:04:24.860> make<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.070> difference

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:38.339 

and<00:04:30.189> there's<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.650> inlet<00:04:32.650> tube<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:37.349> the

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
and there's the inlet tube and the

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.080 
and there's the inlet tube and the
adjustable<00:04:38.830> flow<00:04:41.400> kind<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.490> hard<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.789> turn<00:04:42.909> by

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
adjustable flow kind of hard to turn by

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.140 
adjustable flow kind of hard to turn by
hand

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.200 

so<00:04:47.690> that's<00:04:47.870> full<00:04:48.229> flow

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.800 

a<00:04:54.300> little<00:04:54.840> bit<00:04:54.930> lower

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.420 

one<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.680> things<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.920> had<00:04:59.010> to<00:04:59.040> do<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.340> get

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
one of the things I had to do to get

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.370 
one of the things I had to do to get
this<00:05:01.280> filter<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.400> fit<00:05:02.550> on<00:05:02.640> this<00:05:02.760> tank<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:04.320> is

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
this filter to fit on this tank this is

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.520 
this filter to fit on this tank this is
the<00:05:05.090> original<00:05:06.090> filter<00:05:06.600> by<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.780> way<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:10.020> this

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
the original filter by the way and this

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.110 
the original filter by the way and this
filter<00:05:10.830> basically<00:05:11.340> just<00:05:11.490> sits<00:05:11.730> on<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:11.940> left

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
filter basically just sits on the left

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.110 
filter basically just sits on the left
side<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.510> tank<00:05:12.720> here<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.760> can<00:05:14.910> see

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
side of the tank here and you can see

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.550 
side of the tank here and you can see
that<00:05:15.240> all<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.480> algae<00:05:15.780> grows<00:05:16.020> from<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.350> light

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
that all the algae grows from the light

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.110 
that all the algae grows from the light
because<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.950> light<00:05:16.980> is<00:05:17.280> shining<00:05:17.310> right<00:05:17.760> on<00:05:17.820> it

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
because the light is shining right on it

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.540 
because the light is shining right on it
and<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.200> also<00:05:19.500> that<00:05:19.980> would<00:05:20.100> block<00:05:20.310> all<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
and it also that would block all the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.720 
and it also that would block all the
light<00:05:20.820> down<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.690> left<00:05:21.870> side<00:05:22.020> of<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.230> tank

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
light down to the left side of the tank

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.210 
light down to the left side of the tank
and<00:05:26.960> see<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.140> piece<00:05:28.320> of<00:05:28.440> plastic<00:05:28.890> was<00:05:29.070> in

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
and see this piece of plastic was in

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.850 
and see this piece of plastic was in
here<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:30.750> helps<00:05:30.990> support<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.470> filter

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
here and it helps support that filter

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.250 
here and it helps support that filter
but<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.040> just<00:05:32.220> use<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.460> dremel<00:05:32.790> tool<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.330> cut<00:05:34.140> it

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
but I just use a dremel tool and cut it

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.210 
but I just use a dremel tool and cut it
out<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:34.980> can<00:05:35.130> kind<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.400> see<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:37.230> edges

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.500 

but<00:05:41.220> if<00:05:41.340> you<00:05:41.550> know<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.850> took<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:42.030> few<00:05:42.150> minutes<00:05:42.240> to

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
but if you know it took a few minutes to

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.720 
but if you know it took a few minutes to
cut<00:05:42.660> out<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.680> then<00:05:43.980> it's<00:05:44.160> a<00:05:44.250> lot<00:05:44.370> easier<00:05:44.610> to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
cut out and then it's a lot easier to

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.659 
cut out and then it's a lot easier to
fill<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:45.060> fit<00:05:45.419> this<00:05:45.540> filter<00:05:45.870> on<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:49.669> that's

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
fill this fit this filter on so that's

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:51.720 
fill this fit this filter on so that's
it

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
it
