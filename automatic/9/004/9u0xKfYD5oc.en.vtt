my body as a shield since this negates

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.850 
my body as a shield since this negates
the<00:03:21.310> activation<00:03:21.660> destroys<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:23.110> monster<00:03:23.590> it

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
the activation destroys the monster it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.850 
the activation destroys the monster it

will live to see another day because the
activation<00:03:28.870> was<00:03:28.990> negated<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:30.040> therefore

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
activation was negated so therefore

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.620
