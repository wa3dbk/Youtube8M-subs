00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 or the androids as you are welcome to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.299
 a new video today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.069
 record the screen of your 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.139
 Android device 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 the procedure will vary according to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.190
 Android version that you have installed 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.039
 on your android as well as if you have it 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.359
 rooted or you do not have it rooted I'm going to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.770
 try in this video the three 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.590
 possibilities for everyone 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.590
 get it done on your mobile device 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.950
 let's start with the ones that you already have 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 android lollipop 5.0 or higher 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.239
 installed on your android device 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 These are the ones who have the most 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.230
 simple because since it's a bit more 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 open this android version in the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 google pay you will find enough 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 applications being for me act screen 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 remember the one that I liked the most 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.100
 you need root you can 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.140
 be free and when the breeze already 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.719
 this little contextual menu opens up 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.609
 in which you can simply access 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.100
 the settings to change the resolution and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.500
 other things like hitting the red button and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.610
 you would be recording the screen you can 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.370
 download the notification bar to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.740
 as well as blocking the screen and there will be 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.980
 saved capture automatically 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.170
 from here we can also there is I'm going 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.240
 to get off and there as you can see it has already been 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.760
 successfully completed recording 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 the screen case number 2 for all 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.060
 that you have previous versions to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.090
 lollipop as for example this is the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.430
 Android kitkat case and if you have it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.080
 rooted for all of you you have in 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.810
 the store applications like for example 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.130
 rec rec dot screen ry coorder that stops 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.690
 It's me that worked the most and 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.610
 better in this case for example we give 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 to open has a pretty interface 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.110
 simple you can adjust the resolution of 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.390
 the recording evidently the best 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.490
 resolution to record will always be the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.950
 own resolution of the screen no more 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.250
 no less and we will simply give 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.440
 record as you see, he asks me to accept him and 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.210
 from the superuser's permission and so 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.280
 I do it too, you can take away the tick 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 so that he asks us every time and says 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.410
 recording in 4 32 10 in the pro version 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.450
 you can also activate the recording of 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.310
 audio and make it a bit longer but 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.800
 now I would be recording the screen 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.080
 As you can see, it says that it is being recorded 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.270
 we stop to record and will be processing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.400
 right now the video usually does not take 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.170
 a lot like about 5 seconds as you can see 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.630
 it's finished recording and we can press 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.090
 to see what we recorded very well 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.830
 hey well now let's go to the third case the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.710
 that you have previous versions of 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.630
 android and you do not have it rooted is a 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.610
 the time we will divide it into two cases the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.710
 first obviously it will be much more 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.910
 simple that the second the first one goes 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.990
 to apply for all you have 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:47.380
 from android 4.2 android 4.4 is to say or 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.910
 4.2 or 4.3 or 4.4 on a samsung lg huawei 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.350
 or an alcatel 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.420
 if you have a mobile phone of these four 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.840
 brands that you have in the versions of 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.370
 Android from 4.2 to 4.4 are you 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.590
 congratulations because you are going to be able to use 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.270
 this application that is called mobilize 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.550
 I will complete the process 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.580
 installation together with you 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.560
 upon entering we accept the conditions 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.750
 we click on our account 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.660
 we create an alphanumeric password of 6 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.340
 characters and we give a following here 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.250
 will tell us that installation is required 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.320
 additional motor to connect back 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.150
 of the wifi and we give it to install and we 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.070
 will take as you see to install the plugin 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.200
 in this case as my mobile is a samsung 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.120
 says the samsung plugin 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.610
 if you have a huawei a heretic or a 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.310
 alcatel or it will be the same they send two to him 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.900
 of this we give to 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.970
 next says that he has been 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.330
 installed the plugin and it tells us that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.250
 we have to activate the buggy usb like this 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.050
 that we go here to activate it 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.020
 within the developer options 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.690
 and we're going to enable usb debugging and 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.750
 we confirm and go back to the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.160
 application says that it is already selected 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.690
 we continue we are going to tell 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.850
 that we download let's say your 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.800
 application for the computer but it's not going 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.110
 to be needed and here we can do 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.630
 click to record the screen and how 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.390
 we see here if we press is going to record the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.610
 screen and if we put it here it's going to 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.500
 remove the widget we can take a 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.690
 Capture the screen to mode 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.850
 photographic or what is interesting about the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.799
 We are going to click on it and it will start 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.829
 to record the screen as you are watching 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.260
 that says recording we click to stop 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.190
 recording and now we will have done yes 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.440
 we go down we can go see 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.090
 the recording that we have done very well 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.800
 androids because we have already covered all 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.960
 the previous cases with the best 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.820
 available applications that are all 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.230
 very cool but still the last one 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.300
 case of the case 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.950
 3b to put it in some way that is 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.470
 for all those who do not have lollipop 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.570
 that you do not have the device rooted and 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.300
 that is neither a samsung lg nor a game 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.150
 nor an alcatel for all of you there 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.740
 some possibilities to record it the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.780
 I've tried on most are pretty 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.000
 kaka but the only one that is saved is the 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.440
 next ricordeau board that has this 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.970
 icon and good you can find in 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.130
 google play to name of free record 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.470
 non-root screen this is an application 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.510
 who will need the computer to be 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.550
 activated the only one of the entire video 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.230
 basically when we open it says that 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.630
 this application will guide us through 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.180
 the configuration blah blah blah we give to 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.440
 ok well this is advertising and it tells us 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.300
 that now from our computer 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.640
 we have to visit remembered book point 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.320
 mobile installs them to your 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.510
 computer you enter to this web and os 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.130
 downloads the program of the record or goal 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.960
 for the computer you follow the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.360
 configuration will ask us to connect it 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.130
 via usb cable and the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.700
 activation and now yes that from the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.740
 own 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.600
 application on your mobile you can 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.030
 record the screen in the same way as 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.350
 all the previous cases so nothing 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.420
 androids up here the video today 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.130
 I hope you liked that it was 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.200
 useful and if so, do not forget to give it a 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.060
 good like to help the pro community 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.620

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.620
 until the next androids
