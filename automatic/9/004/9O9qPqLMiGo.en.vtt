00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:10.530
 Well too much unfortunately 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 I don't think there is enough time to be with the children yet 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.940
 So when you're together 100% 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 In particular we have concentrated being together 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:29.610
 You want to have big time playing in has changed with children, for example, wearing a mobile phone 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:37.290
 Fish farm for eel 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:40.470
 I entered in there if there is a go been one like something pond is the best Route animals of eels are swimming 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.400
 Have you cleaned Te 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.450
 It was quite an experience, impressive 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.160
 I still want to make neta at all 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.090
 That 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.150
 It's fun I'm doing with the knife and so on 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.040
 I have been doing all the way from fun until the end 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.610
 Japan 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.610
 overthrow 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.400
 Claims and the car 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:16.990
 I think there are many people who are still you 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.900
 It is completely different place which is to care Toka how far to go? And the good while 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 is not it 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:28.050
 American traffic is not more different from that quite rude whether a fairly provocative expression, such as feeling 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.380
 Japan is relatively cheap 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.000
 It is one big place called because it says you're doing a care 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.700
 It's strange, isn't it 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.560
 Because it is an intertainment 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:49.899
 This thing is not to make things from something yourself 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:55.159
 Than not like there is a Toka one media by using 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:59.480
 Because it is a business that people should have fun 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:05.659
 Is it hard to predict it? 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.630
 It is a little business and the dive's other business Lieutenant General 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.619
 There 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.920
 First of all I think that there is no one who can not miss the sentence 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.200
 I have to just step out 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.390
 Because I think that it is the reason to choose it by all means whether to take the foot in that way 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.370
 Just something 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:32.390
 Do you want me to take something with me 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.370
 I think that it is not possible to move just because it is decided that such a thing can not be done 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.400
 I will 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.850
 So 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.990
 However 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.650
 You can do it yourself, so it may be from a little bit, but for now 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.970
 And what do to try to do 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.970
 I think color is important 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.010
 Want to do 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.010
 Good pitch 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:06.010
 I think that it is better to think from the point that those who find employment in Japan are mostly in companies 0 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:13.330
 I think I will decide but what I want to do even if I enter this class 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.310
 I think it will be easier to get in if you know the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.890
 so 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 I think it would be better for you to think for yourself what you want to do before you enter 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.240
 It may be fun once in a lifetime 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.240
 O more than o
