food<00:01:25.020> fairies<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:25.979> call<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
food fairies that's what i call them so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.170 
food fairies that's what i call them so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
they can take them away but most of the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
they can take them away but most of the
time<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.200> lean<00:01:31.770> towards

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
time what I do is I lean towards

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.819 
time what I do is I lean towards
ordering<00:01:32.820> salad<00:01:33.450> which<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.140> safe<00:01:34.470> as

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
ordering salad which is pretty safe as

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.460 
ordering salad which is pretty safe as
long<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.250> doesn't<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.579> tons<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.630> tortilla

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
long as it doesn't have tons of tortilla

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.039 
long as it doesn't have tons of tortilla
strips<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:38.280> crazy<00:01:39.240> amounts<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.630> cheese<00:01:39.810> or

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
strips or crazy amounts of cheese or

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
strips or crazy amounts of cheese or
anything<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
anything on it like that but I think the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
anything on it like that but I think the
best<00:01:42.329> thing<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.439> far<00:01:43.619> as

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
best thing that you can do as far as

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
best thing that you can do as far as
being<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> real<00:01:44.490> world<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.060> interacting

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
during these activities for example we

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.449 
during these activities for example we
went<00:04:07.100> to<00:04:07.220> Disneyland<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.230> we<00:04:09.230> moderately<00:04:09.920> but

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
went to Disneyland and we moderately but

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.740 
went to Disneyland and we moderately but
we<00:04:10.610> walked<00:04:10.850> for<00:04:11.540> God<00:04:12.380> nine<00:04:12.920> hours<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:14.420> think

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
we walked for God nine hours and I think
