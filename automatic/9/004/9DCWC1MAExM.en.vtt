to<00:00:03.689> change<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.200> fluid<00:00:04.380> inside<00:00:04.620> your

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
to change the fluid inside your

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.690 
to change the fluid inside your
differential<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.899> not<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> hard<00:00:07.379> job<00:00:07.610> all<00:00:08.610> right

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
differential is not a hard job all right

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.020 
differential is not a hard job all right
so<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.230> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.500> back<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.650> any

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030

rear-wheel drive car is going to be

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.530 
rear-wheel drive car is going to be
something<00:00:13.019> like<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
something like this but this one is a

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.849 
something like this but this one is a
Camaro<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.279> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> 10<00:00:17.820> bolt<00:00:18.029> rear<00:00:18.420> end

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
Camaro and this is a 10 bolt rear end

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.050 
Camaro and this is a 10 bolt rear end
one<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> easiest<00:00:20.189> ways<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.369> drain<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
one of the easiest ways to drain out the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.529 
one of the easiest ways to drain out the
fluid<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.020> undo<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> bolts<00:00:23.090> all<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.480> way

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
fluid is to undo the bolts all the way

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.310 
fluid is to undo the bolts all the way
up<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.439> somewhere<00:00:26.070> close<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> top

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
up to here somewhere close to the top

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.390 
up to here somewhere close to the top
you<00:00:28.320> could<00:00:28.500> even<00:00:28.590> choose<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> way

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
you could even choose to do all the way

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.470 
you could even choose to do all the way
up<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> top<00:00:29.699> bolt<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> reason<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
up to the top bolt the reason you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.189 
up to the top bolt the reason you
wouldn't<00:00:30.599> want<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> pull<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> whole<00:00:31.170> thing

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wouldn't want to pull the whole thing

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
wouldn't want to pull the whole thing
off<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.679> because<00:00:32.090> there's<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> bigger<00:00:33.329> chance

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
off this because there's a bigger chance

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959 
off this because there's a bigger chance
of<00:00:33.750> fluid<00:00:34.590> gushing<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.610> happens<00:00:35.880> if

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
of fluid gushing out so what happens if

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.660 
of fluid gushing out so what happens if
you<00:00:36.260> just<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.530> close<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> top<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you just go up close to the top is that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.979 
you just go up close to the top is that
you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.910> actually<00:00:40.040> pull<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.190> back<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.989> little

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you can actually pull this back a little

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.119 
you can actually pull this back a little
bit<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.969> separate<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.350> cover<00:00:46.739> from

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
bit so that will separate the cover from

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.190 
bit so that will separate the cover from
the<00:00:47.160> differential<00:00:47.840> basically<00:00:48.840> you'll<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the differential basically you'll have a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.660 
the differential basically you'll have a
little<00:00:49.530> opening<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:50.579> you're

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
little opening right here where you're

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
little opening right here where you're
seeing<00:00:50.850> orange<00:00:51.300> where<00:00:51.539> fluid<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.020> run<00:00:52.199> out

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
seeing orange where fluid can run out

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
seeing orange where fluid can run out
but<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.129> spill<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.670> completely<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.360> once

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
but not spill out completely so once

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.850 
but not spill out completely so once
it's<00:00:54.809> done<00:00:54.930> draining<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> take<00:00:55.680> off<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it's done draining you can take off the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's done draining you can take off the
rest<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> bolts<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.960> get<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> work<00:00:58.250> so<00:01:00.680> if

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
rest of the bolts and get to work so if

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.840 
rest of the bolts and get to work so if
you<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> Camaro<00:01:02.399> you'll<00:01:02.550> notice<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you have a Camaro you'll notice that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
you have a Camaro you'll notice that
this<00:01:03.149> bar<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.439> rear<00:01:04.619> sway<00:01:04.860> bar<00:01:05.070> is

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
this bar this is your rear sway bar is

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550 
this bar this is your rear sway bar is
kind<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.790> way<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.930> getting<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> these

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
kind of in the way of getting to these

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
kind of in the way of getting to these
bolts<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.070> hard<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> wrench<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.880> them

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bolts it's hard to put a wrench on them

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.859 
bolts it's hard to put a wrench on them
so<00:01:09.840> about<00:01:10.170> two<00:01:10.350> years<00:01:10.470> ago<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.890> car<00:01:11.689> had<00:01:12.689> not

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so about two years ago in my car had not

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.410 
so about two years ago in my car had not
been<00:01:13.250> lowered<00:01:14.250> yet<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.299> bit

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
been lowered yet and it was a little bit

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
been lowered yet and it was a little bit
easier<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.619> been<00:01:16.770> dropped

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
easier but now that it's been dropped

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.670 
easier but now that it's been dropped
about<00:01:17.250> an<00:01:17.610> inch<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.630> bar<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:19.080> completely

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
about an inch this bar is now completely

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.820 
about an inch this bar is now completely
in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.490> way<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> those<00:01:20.880> bolts<00:01:21.470> easy<00:01:22.470> fix

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
in the way of those bolts easy fix

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.510 
in the way of those bolts easy fix
though<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:25.110> situation<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
though if this is a situation that you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.539 
though if this is a situation that you
have<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.790> well<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> live<00:01:28.860> rear<00:01:29.070> axle<00:01:29.159> car

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
have as well so on a live rear axle car

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
have as well so on a live rear axle car
you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.850> these<00:01:30.090> shackles<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.380> over<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you have these shackles that go over the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
you have these shackles that go over the
top<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> axle<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> bushing

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
top of the axle and you have a bushing

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
top of the axle and you have a bushing
and<00:01:34.740> basically<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.939> screw<00:01:36.150> here

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and basically there's just a screw here

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.520 
and basically there's just a screw here
and<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.750> back<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.200> you'll<00:01:37.350> find

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and one in the back and you'll find

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
and one in the back and you'll find
these<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> either<00:01:37.920> side<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> axle<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
these on either side of the axle and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.740 
these on either side of the axle and
this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.549> extremely<00:01:41.549> easy<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> undo<00:01:43.579> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
this is a extremely easy to undo and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
this is a extremely easy to undo and
they're<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:45.869> under<00:01:46.140> pressure<00:01:46.380> they're<00:01:46.619> not

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
they're not under pressure they're not

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.810 
they're not under pressure they're not
tension<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> worry<00:01:47.729> about

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
tension so you don't to worry about

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
tension so you don't to worry about
things<00:01:48.090> spring<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.229> hitting<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619

things spring and hitting you in the
face<00:01:50.540> anything<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.350> only<00:01:52.500> thing

face anything like that the only thing
I'd<00:01:52.649> say<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> live<00:01:53.369> somewhere<00:01:53.399> where

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
I'd say is if you live somewhere where

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
I'd say is if you live somewhere where
it's<00:01:53.970> rusty<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:55.020> might<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.409> bit

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it's rusty they might be a little bit

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.660 
it's rusty they might be a little bit

too much rust despite what it looks like

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and the fluid is drained out you'll take

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.610 
and the fluid is drained out you'll take
this<00:02:12.780> back<00:02:13.050> cap

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

off and clean it off as best as you can

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.910 
off and clean it off as best as you can
with<00:02:16.980> something<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.599> rate<00:02:18.599> cleaner

I solvent works best it sucks for the

I solvent works best it sucks for the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
using it but but it does the job better

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.670 
using it but but it does the job better

want a clean seal especially along here

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.750 
want a clean seal especially along here
because<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> backside<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.610> where

your new gasket is going to go if you

you're going to want to clean that off

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.050 
you're going to want to clean that off
too<00:02:45.070> because<00:02:45.370> you're<00:02:45.640> not<00:02:45.760> going<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.030> a

too because you're not going to get a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.450 
too because you're not going to get a
good<00:02:46.300> seal<00:02:46.600> unless<00:02:47.140> both<00:02:47.440> sides<00:02:47.740> are<00:02:47.980> down<00:02:48.190> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
as close to bare metal as you can get

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.440 
as close to bare metal as you can get
all<00:02:51.070> right<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.700> actually<00:02:52.090> after<00:02:52.360> I've

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
all right so this is actually after I've

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.450 
all right so this is actually after I've
done<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.900> whole<00:02:53.050> job<00:02:53.350> Andrey<00:02:54.100> bolted

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
done the whole job Andrey bolted

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.710 
done the whole job Andrey bolted
everything<00:02:54.820> up<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.240> what<00:02:55.420> you're<00:02:55.540> seeing

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
everything up and so what you're seeing

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.980 
everything up and so what you're seeing
right<00:02:56.020> here<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.680> reddish<00:02:57.070> orange<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.990> RTV

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
right here this reddish orange is RTV

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.520 
right here this reddish orange is RTV
sealant<00:02:59.230> which<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.340> room<00:03:00.820> temperature

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
sealant which is room temperature

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.080 
sealant which is room temperature
vulcanized<00:03:02.530> rubber<00:03:02.920> comes<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
vulcanized rubber comes out of the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.120 
vulcanized rubber comes out of the
liquid<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:05.230> don't<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.740> put<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.950> over<00:03:06.040> top

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
liquid you don't have to put it over top

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.920 
liquid you don't have to put it over top
of<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.490> gasket<00:03:06.880> but<00:03:07.000> my<00:03:07.240> experience<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.810> get

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
of the gasket but my experience you get

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.300 
of the gasket but my experience you get
a<00:03:07.990> better<00:03:08.230> result<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:09.130> way<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:11.310> means

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
a better result that way so that means

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.190 
a better result that way so that means
I've<00:03:12.520> taken<00:03:13.090> everything<00:03:13.330> off<00:03:13.570> drain<00:03:14.080> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
I've taken everything off drain the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.200 
I've taken everything off drain the
fluid<00:03:14.560> cleaned<00:03:14.920> everything<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.400> reapplied

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
fluid cleaned everything up reapplied

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.700 
fluid cleaned everything up reapplied
the<00:03:16.540> gasket<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.260> sealer<00:03:18.120> put<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.210> on<00:03:19.330> here

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
the gasket and the sealer put it on here

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.470 
the gasket and the sealer put it on here
bolted<00:03:20.710> it<00:03:20.800> up<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.100> let<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.220> sit<00:03:21.490> overnight

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.960 

you<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.800> do<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
you don't have to do that but it is a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.850 
you don't have to do that but it is a
good<00:03:27.150> idea<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.480> wait<00:03:27.750> at<00:03:27.989> least<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.530> few<00:03:28.799> hours

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
good idea to wait at least a few hours

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.030 
good idea to wait at least a few hours
before<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.970> pour<00:03:30.360> more<00:03:31.110> fluid<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.680> basically

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
before you pour more fluid and basically

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.880 
before you pour more fluid and basically
it's<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.489> cure<00:03:32.760> better<00:03:33.379> if<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:34.739> is

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's going to cure better if it is

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.149 
it's going to cure better if it is
relatively<00:03:35.700> dry<00:03:35.970> inside<00:03:36.209> as<00:03:36.799> compared<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.860> if

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
relatively dry inside as compared to if

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.330 
relatively dry inside as compared to if
there<00:03:38.340> was<00:03:38.489> liquid<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:39.180> here<00:03:39.769> already<00:03:40.769> messing

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
there was liquid in here already messing

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.360 
there was liquid in here already messing
with<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.580> seal<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.970> isn't<00:03:42.239> totally<00:03:42.599> set<00:03:42.840> up

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
with the seal that isn't totally set up

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.690 
with the seal that isn't totally set up
does<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.459> make<00:03:44.610> sense<00:03:45.799> okay<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.340> what<00:03:47.610> I'm

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
does that make sense okay so what I'm

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.220 
does that make sense okay so what I'm
down<00:03:48.000> here<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.660> do<00:03:49.459> today<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:51.230> actually

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
down here going to do today is actually

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.520 
down here going to do today is actually
fill<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:52.739> back<00:03:52.950> up<00:03:54.230> you're<00:03:55.230> going<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.409> look

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
fill this back up you're going to look

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.050 
fill this back up you're going to look
for<00:03:55.709> something<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:56.970> have

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
for something like this and if you have

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.190 
for something like this and if you have
a<00:03:57.090> Camaro<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:59.329> over<00:04:00.329> on<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.720> right<00:04:00.959> side

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
a Camaro this is over on the right side

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.650 
a Camaro this is over on the right side
of<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.410> car<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:01.920> if<00:04:02.400> you're<00:04:02.760> underneath<00:04:03.420> it

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
of the car so if you're underneath it

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.030 
of the car so if you're underneath it
laying<00:04:03.840> upside<00:04:04.019> down<00:04:04.319> that'll<00:04:04.620> be<00:04:04.680> your<00:04:04.799> left

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
laying upside down that'll be your left

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280 
laying upside down that'll be your left
but<00:04:05.400> basically<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.450> can<00:04:06.599> just<00:04:06.810> take<00:04:07.079> a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
but basically you can just take a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.140 
but basically you can just take a
ratchet<00:04:07.980> like<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.400> you'll<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.910> find

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
ratchet like this you'll have to find

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.319 
ratchet like this you'll have to find
the<00:04:09.269> correct<00:04:09.560> drive<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:11.160> go<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.459> there<00:04:11.609> right

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
the correct drive to go in there right

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.599 
the correct drive to go in there right
but<00:04:12.599> without<00:04:13.260> putting<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.829> ratchet<00:04:14.280> on<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.489> end

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
but without putting a ratchet on the end

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.099 
but without putting a ratchet on the end
of<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.849> or<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> socket<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:15.750> end<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.019> you

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
of it or a socket on the end of it you

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.250 
of it or a socket on the end of it you
can<00:04:16.229> actually<00:04:16.410> put<00:04:16.889> this<00:04:16.919> in<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:18.359> right<00:04:19.079> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
can actually put this in here right and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.029 
can actually put this in here right and
that<00:04:19.739> will<00:04:19.889> allow<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.570> unscrew<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:22.039> all

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
that will allow you to unscrew that all

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.500 
that will allow you to unscrew that all
right<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.710> that's<00:04:25.830> where<00:04:26.039> we<00:04:26.130> are<00:04:26.330> at<00:04:27.330> least

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
right so that's where we are at least

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.900 
right so that's where we are at least
where<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.720> am<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.110> process<00:04:28.610> when<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.700> take

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
where I am in the process when you take

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.520 
where I am in the process when you take
that<00:04:30.060> out<00:04:30.240> you're<00:04:30.780> going<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.020> actually<00:04:31.200> fill

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
that out you're going to actually fill

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.100 
that out you're going to actually fill
it<00:04:31.680> with<00:04:31.770> fluid<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.190> Camaro<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.729> like<00:04:33.110> 1.75

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
it with fluid a Camaro is like 1.75

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.010 
it with fluid a Camaro is like 1.75
course<00:04:34.590> something<00:04:34.950> like<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.840> i'm<00:04:36.840> not

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
course something like that but i'm not

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.570 
course something like that but i'm not
going<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.260> measure<00:04:37.440> i<00:04:37.620> fill<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.130> up<00:04:38.190> until<00:04:38.550> I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
going to measure i fill it up until I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.750 
going to measure i fill it up until I
can<00:04:38.849> feel<00:04:39.150> right<00:04:39.539> at<00:04:39.660> this<00:04:39.780> lip<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:41.370> fluid

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
can feel right at this lip the fluid

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.730 
can feel right at this lip the fluid
right<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:42.960> should<00:04:43.110> come<00:04:43.139> all<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.620> way<00:04:43.650> up

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
right so it should come all the way up

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.550 
right so it should come all the way up
to<00:04:43.860> here<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.930> don't<00:04:46.080> need<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.289> go<00:04:46.380> any

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
to here and you don't need to go any

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.350 
to here and you don't need to go any
more<00:04:46.680> full<00:04:46.919> than<00:04:46.950> that<00:04:47.220> now<00:04:47.610> if<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:47.940> tried<00:04:48.180> it

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
more full than that now if you tried it

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.820 
more full than that now if you tried it
actually<00:04:48.690> would<00:04:48.960> just<00:04:49.139> come<00:04:49.260> back<00:04:49.349> out<00:04:49.590> so

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
actually would just come back out so

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.440 
actually would just come back out so
this<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:52.280> metal<00:04:53.280> on<00:04:53.430> metal<00:04:53.460> surface<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.300> when

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
this is a metal on metal surface so when

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.640 
this is a metal on metal surface so when
I<00:04:54.539> put<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:54.810> back<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.020> i'm<00:04:55.260> going<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.470> put<00:04:55.620> a

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
I put this back in i'm going to put a

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.159 
I put this back in i'm going to put a
little<00:04:56.010> bit<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.190> sealant<00:04:56.610> around<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:57.169> tighten

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
little bit of sealant around it tighten

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.870 
little bit of sealant around it tighten
it<00:04:58.229> just<00:04:58.500> till<00:04:58.620> it's<00:04:58.770> snug<00:04:59.039> but<00:04:59.310> not<00:04:59.340> over<00:04:59.700> type

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
it just till it's snug but not over type

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.110 
it just till it's snug but not over type
kind<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.389> same<00:05:00.570> way<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.780> would<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
kind of the same way you would do the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.330 
kind of the same way you would do the
bolt<00:05:03.360> foreign<00:05:03.630> oil<00:05:03.690> filter<00:05:04.110> or<00:05:05.039> anything<00:05:05.310> like

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
bolt foreign oil filter or anything like

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.629 
bolt foreign oil filter or anything like
that<00:05:05.750> over<00:05:06.750> tightening<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.349> is<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.370> bad<00:05:08.610> thing

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
that over tightening is is a bad thing

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.060 
that over tightening is is a bad thing
so<00:05:09.510> when<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> work<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.380> avoid<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.919> don't

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
so when I work to avoid that I don't

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.100 
so when I work to avoid that I don't
know<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.280> torque<00:05:11.490> spec<00:05:11.729> on<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:12.960> don't

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
know the torque spec on it and I don't

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.260 
know the torque spec on it and I don't
think<00:05:13.200> my<00:05:13.289> torque<00:05:13.620> wrench<00:05:13.800> would<00:05:13.919> fit<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.880> here

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
think my torque wrench would fit in here

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.210 
think my torque wrench would fit in here
anyway<00:05:15.690> if<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:16.440> wanted<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.770> know<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.889> torque

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
anyway if you wanted to know the torque

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.820 
anyway if you wanted to know the torque
spec<00:05:17.430> for<00:05:17.669> these<00:05:17.789> on<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.270> Camaro<00:05:18.690> it's<00:05:18.960> 22<00:05:19.560> foot

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
spec for these on a Camaro it's 22 foot

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.550 
spec for these on a Camaro it's 22 foot
pounds<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.400> that's<00:05:21.090> what<00:05:21.300> i<00:05:21.330> did<00:05:21.389> in<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:22.199> as

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
pounds so that's what i did in a as

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.659 
pounds so that's what i did in a as
close<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.039> star<00:05:23.190> pattern<00:05:23.729> as<00:05:24.030> possible<00:05:24.510> and

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
close to a star pattern as possible and

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.670 
close to a star pattern as possible and
once<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:26.789> finish<00:05:27.090> go<00:05:27.360> back<00:05:27.539> in<00:05:27.720> tighten<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.530> in

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
once you finish go back in tighten it in

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.980 
once you finish go back in tighten it in
that<00:05:28.830> same<00:05:29.160> star<00:05:29.639> pattern<00:05:30.030> again<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.510> you'll

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
that same star pattern again and you'll

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.210 
that same star pattern again and you'll
make<00:05:31.139> sure<00:05:31.169> that<00:05:31.320> everything's<00:05:31.740> snugged<00:05:32.070> up

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
make sure that everything's snugged up

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.380 
make sure that everything's snugged up
and<00:05:32.430> you're<00:05:32.880> unlikely<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.479> get<00:05:33.659> a<00:05:33.690> leak<00:05:33.900> again

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
and you're unlikely to get a leak again

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.450 
and you're unlikely to get a leak again
so<00:05:36.390> that's<00:05:36.659> everything<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.770> can<00:05:37.919> think<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.219> tell

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
so that's everything I can think to tell

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.490 
so that's everything I can think to tell
if<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:38.580> have<00:05:38.669> questions<00:05:39.060> just<00:05:39.210> ask<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.440> i'll

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
if you have questions just ask and i'll

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.850 
if you have questions just ask and i'll
try<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.430> get<00:05:41.610> back<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.000> not<00:05:42.569> a<00:05:42.600> hard<00:05:43.410> job<00:05:43.650> as

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
try to get back to you not a hard job as

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.409 
try to get back to you not a hard job as
I<00:05:43.979> mentioned<00:05:44.310> just<00:05:44.370> potential<00:05:45.180> for

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
I mentioned just potential for

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.450 
I mentioned just potential for
frustrations<00:05:46.139> if<00:05:46.319> you<00:05:46.440> don't<00:05:47.039> have<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.280> move

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
frustrations if you don't have to move

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.089 
frustrations if you don't have to move
these<00:05:47.610> or<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.360> know<00:05:49.229> end<00:05:49.500> up<00:05:49.680> spilling<00:05:49.919> with

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
these or you know end up spilling with

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.010 
these or you know end up spilling with
the<00:05:50.160> concrete's<00:05:50.580> so<00:05:51.389> there<00:05:51.539> isn't<00:05:51.810> really<00:05:51.900> a

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
the concrete's so there isn't really a

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.450 
the concrete's so there isn't really a
good<00:05:52.229> way<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.620> I'm<00:05:52.740> aware<00:05:52.979> of<00:05:53.039> to<00:05:53.280> put

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
good way that I'm aware of to put

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.270 
good way that I'm aware of to put
differential<00:05:54.180> fluid<00:05:54.270> into<00:05:54.599> this<00:05:54.750> car<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.919> have

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
differential fluid into this car I have

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.719 
differential fluid into this car I have
this<00:05:56.490> which<00:05:57.419> looks<00:05:58.229> like<00:05:59.099> it<00:05:59.220> would<00:05:59.340> work<00:05:59.400> a

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
this which looks like it would work a

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:00.939 
this which looks like it would work a
little<00:05:59.880> bit<00:06:00.000> better<00:06:00.120> than<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.449> actually<00:06:00.599> does

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
little bit better than it actually does

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.650 
little bit better than it actually does
it<00:06:01.949> has<00:06:02.069> a<00:06:02.099> valve<00:06:02.340> in<00:06:02.490> here<00:06:02.699> so<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:02.970> can<00:06:03.210> invert

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
it has a valve in here so you can invert

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.180 
it has a valve in here so you can invert
it<00:06:03.720> without<00:06:04.020> it<00:06:04.199> immediately<00:06:04.560> spilling<00:06:05.069> out

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
it without it immediately spilling out

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.670 
it without it immediately spilling out
and<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.150> idea<00:06:06.419> is<00:06:06.509> that<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:07.020> end<00:06:07.169> of<00:06:07.349> it<00:06:07.470> goes

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
and the idea is that the end of it goes

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.620 
and the idea is that the end of it goes
into<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:08.099> fill<00:06:08.490> plug<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:09.120> problem<00:06:09.449> is<00:06:09.509> is

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
into the fill plug the problem is is

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.390 
into the fill plug the problem is is
it's<00:06:09.780> very<00:06:09.870> difficult<00:06:10.259> to<00:06:10.530> get<00:06:10.740> this<00:06:10.949> bottle

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
it's very difficult to get this bottle

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.219 
it's very difficult to get this bottle
higher<00:06:12.000> than<00:06:12.300> that<00:06:12.419> hole<00:06:12.660> which<00:06:12.930> means<00:06:13.139> you

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
higher than that hole which means you

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.350 
higher than that hole which means you
have<00:06:13.410> to<00:06:13.440> apply<00:06:14.310> pressure<00:06:14.520> to<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.849> bottle<00:06:15.210> to

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
have to apply pressure to the bottle to

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.350 
have to apply pressure to the bottle to
get<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.020> work<00:06:16.430> and<00:06:17.430> that's<00:06:17.639> okay<00:06:17.910> until<00:06:18.240> the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
get it to work and that's okay until the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.570 
get it to work and that's okay until the
bottle<00:06:18.599> starts<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:18.990> get<00:06:19.080> empty<00:06:19.380> and<00:06:19.530> then<00:06:20.370> it's

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
bottle starts to get empty and then it's

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.909 
bottle starts to get empty and then it's
a<00:06:20.789> challenge<00:06:21.210> in<00:06:21.780> this<00:06:21.930> card<00:06:22.199> is<00:06:22.410> possible<00:06:22.830> to

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
a challenge in this card is possible to

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.640 
a challenge in this card is possible to
sort<00:06:23.220> of<00:06:23.370> invert<00:06:23.669> it<00:06:23.960> above<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:24.990> axle<00:06:25.440> if<00:06:25.560> you

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
sort of invert it above the axle if you

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.740 
sort of invert it above the axle if you
can<00:06:25.800> fit<00:06:26.039> it<00:06:26.130> through<00:06:26.160> that<00:06:26.400> space<00:06:26.699> but<00:06:27.030> tends

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
can fit it through that space but tends

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.629 
can fit it through that space but tends
to<00:06:27.900> make<00:06:28.020> a<00:06:28.080> mess<00:06:28.320> more<00:06:28.530> often<00:06:28.770> than<00:06:28.919> not<00:06:28.979> so<00:06:29.310> if

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
to make a mess more often than not so if

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.249 
to make a mess more often than not so if
you've<00:06:29.789> got<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.000> tip<00:06:30.570> or<00:06:30.780> something<00:06:30.810> that<00:06:31.110> works

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
you've got a tip or something that works

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.930 
you've got a tip or something that works
for<00:06:31.470> you<00:06:31.560> that's<00:06:32.400> actually<00:06:32.669> something<00:06:32.729> that

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
for you that's actually something that

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.640 
for you that's actually something that
that<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.419> would<00:06:33.630> like<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.780> know<00:06:33.900> so<00:06:34.169> leave<00:06:34.530> in

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
that I would like to know so leave in

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.189 
that I would like to know so leave in
the<00:06:34.710> comments<00:06:35.130> whatever<00:06:35.340> you<00:06:35.550> need<00:06:36.139> and<00:06:37.139> i

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
the comments whatever you need and i

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.100 
the comments whatever you need and i
should<00:06:37.349> say<00:06:37.500> this<00:06:37.889> card<00:06:38.130> does<00:06:38.250> not<00:06:38.430> have<00:06:38.610> a

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
should say this card does not have a

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.689 
should say this card does not have a
limited<00:06:40.110> slip<00:06:40.259> differential<00:06:40.860> so<00:06:41.400> i<00:06:41.430> don't

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
limited slip differential so i don't

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.129 
limited slip differential so i don't
have<00:06:41.729> to<00:06:41.849> add<00:06:42.030> anything<00:06:42.389> other<00:06:42.720> than<00:06:42.870> the

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
have to add anything other than the

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.379 
have to add anything other than the
fluid<00:06:43.949> i'd<00:06:44.130> only<00:06:44.280> would<00:06:44.490> hurt<00:06:44.669> at<00:06:44.909> all<00:06:44.970> if<00:06:45.300> i

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
fluid i'd only would hurt at all if i

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.149 
fluid i'd only would hurt at all if i
did<00:06:45.599> but<00:06:45.810> it's<00:06:46.080> just<00:06:46.259> an<00:06:46.349> extra<00:06:46.590> cost<00:06:46.800> and

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
did but it's just an extra cost and

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.670 
did but it's just an extra cost and
since<00:06:47.669> this<00:06:47.820> isn't<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.210> race<00:06:48.360> car<00:06:48.570> i<00:06:48.810> also

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
since this isn't a race car i also

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.930 
since this isn't a race car i also
didn't<00:06:49.979> go<00:06:50.070> with<00:06:50.220> any<00:06:50.370> fluid<00:06:50.789> that's

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
didn't go with any fluid that's

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.580 
didn't go with any fluid that's
exceedingly<00:06:51.360> expensive<00:06:51.810> right<00:06:52.229> my<00:06:52.380> didn't

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
exceedingly expensive right my didn't

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.170 
exceedingly expensive right my didn't
buy<00:06:52.680> the<00:06:52.740> six<00:06:53.039> dollar<00:06:53.220> stuff<00:06:53.520> i<00:06:53.729> also<00:06:53.909> didn't

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
buy the six dollar stuff i also didn't

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.830 
buy the six dollar stuff i also didn't
buy<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.330> $25<00:06:55.020> stuff<00:06:55.320> so<00:06:56.419> do<00:06:57.419> it's<00:06:57.570> right<00:06:57.719> for

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
buy the $25 stuff so do it's right for

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.620 
buy the $25 stuff so do it's right for
your<00:06:57.930> car<00:06:58.139> but<00:06:58.979> that's<00:06:59.639> kind<00:06:59.849> of<00:06:59.909> how<00:07:00.300> i<00:07:00.330> made

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
your car but that's kind of how i made

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.170 
your car but that's kind of how i made
