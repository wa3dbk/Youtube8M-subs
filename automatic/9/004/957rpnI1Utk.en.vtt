00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
basically we're going to do fruits in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.920 
basically we're going to do fruits in
three<00:01:05.820> easy<00:01:06.060> steps

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
three easy steps

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.280 
three easy steps
you<00:01:07.350> usually<00:01:07.619> start<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.880> fruit<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you usually start from the fruit in the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
you usually start from the fruit in the
focal<00:01:10.650> point<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.610> later<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> add

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
focal point and later on you can add

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.320 
focal point and later on you can add
more<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> beginning<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
more but in the beginning you do the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.740 
more but in the beginning you do the
major<00:01:16.020> fruits<00:01:16.890> either<00:01:17.600> goecart

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
major fruits either goecart

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
major fruits either goecart
or<00:01:19.080> lemon<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.420> peach<00:01:21.950> cherry<00:01:22.950> whatever<00:01:23.850> and

or lemon or peach cherry whatever and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.780 
or lemon or peach cherry whatever and
then<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.020> add<00:01:25.729> leaves<00:01:27.680> after<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.610> add

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
then you add leaves after that you add

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.039 
then you add leaves after that you add
branches<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:31.290> stand<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> stock<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
branches or stand to the stock to the

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.130 
branches or stand to the stock to the
roots<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> fruits<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.119> basically<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
roots so all the fruits are basically in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.219 
roots so all the fruits are basically in
this<00:01:37.470> three<00:01:37.920> easy<00:01:38.369> steps<00:01:38.549> fruits<00:01:39.450> leaves<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
this three easy steps fruits leaves and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.420 
this three easy steps fruits leaves and
branches<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:42.329> branches<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.250> might

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
branches the branches are as you might

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.200 
branches the branches are as you might
recall<00:01:45.170> time<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.590> plan<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.909> Chi

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
recall time my plan is kind of for Chi

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.240 
recall time my plan is kind of for Chi
so<00:01:50.000> blossom<00:01:51.259> branches<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> used<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so blossom branches will be used and the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.630 
so blossom branches will be used and the
leaves<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.420> less<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.640> bamboo

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
leaves more or less it's like bamboo

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you know like a big bamboo

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.020 
you know like a big bamboo
they've<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.720> brought<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> net<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.000> like<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
wider or longer so more or less the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.279 
wider or longer so more or less the
organization<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.220> leaves<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> bamboo

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
organization of leaves is like a bamboo

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.729 
organization of leaves is like a bamboo
so<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.860> they<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.130> overlapping<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.739> because

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
so that they are overlapping and because

of the idea of painting loquats you'll
see<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.480> separate<00:03:22.049> demos<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.859> different

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
see in separate demos the different

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.530 
see in separate demos the different
approaches<00:03:24.659> but<00:03:25.049> basically<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
approaches but basically you do the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.069 
approaches but basically you do the
fruits<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.870> want<00:03:28.709> shape<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.329> do<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.810> one

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
fruits you want shape you can do the one

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
stroke multiple strokes two strokes and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.059 
stroke multiple strokes two strokes and
different<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.000> colored<00:03:36.450> light<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:38.209> darker

multiple<00:03:41.069> do't<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:41.670> basically<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.359> shape

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
multiple do't but basically the shape

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.069 
multiple do't but basically the shape
and<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.079> stroke<00:03:43.409> is<00:03:43.680> like<00:03:43.889> a<00:03:44.370> big<00:03:45.060> grade<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
and the stroke is like a big grade you

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.099 
and the stroke is like a big grade you
know<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.439> a<00:03:46.560> big<00:03:46.799> round<00:03:47.700> groove<00:03:48.359> but<00:03:48.870> want

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
know just a big round groove but want

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.460 
know just a big round groove but want
shade<00:03:50.299> fruit<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:53.010> leaves<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.849> like

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
shade fruit and the leaves is like

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.610 
shade fruit and the leaves is like
bamboo<00:03:55.470> leaves<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.760> then<00:03:56.909> add<00:03:57.150> veins<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.470> it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
bamboo leaves and then add veins to it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.679 
bamboo leaves and then add veins to it
the<00:03:59.370> van<00:03:59.639> is<00:03:59.909> heavier<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.310> center<00:04:02.689> the

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
the van is heavier in the center the

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.069 
the van is heavier in the center the
soft<00:04:04.260> voice<00:04:04.639> in<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.849> other<00:04:06.450> end

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
soft voice in the other end

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.550 
soft voice in the other end
so<00:04:08.010> some<00:04:08.669> are<00:04:08.849> parallel<00:04:09.919> with<00:04:10.919> ugly<00:04:11.340> and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
so some are parallel with ugly and

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.879 
so some are parallel with ugly and
denser<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.010> tip<00:04:14.780> will<00:04:15.780> also<00:04:16.500> study

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
denser to the tip will also study

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.750 
denser to the tip will also study
specific<00:04:17.930> chili<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.139> no-cut<00:04:19.859> when<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:20.489> go<00:04:20.699> to

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
specific chili of no-cut when we go to

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.740 
specific chili of no-cut when we go to
the<00:04:21.060> garlic<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.820> branch<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.419> very

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
the garlic and the branch is very

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.279 
the garlic and the branch is very
important<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.590> create<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.490> movement<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.479> the

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
important to create the movement and the

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.070 
important to create the movement and the
supports<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.449> supporting<00:04:30.449> structure<00:04:30.930> of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
supports of the supporting structure of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.710 
supports of the supporting structure of
the<00:04:31.260> composition<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.130> we<00:04:32.639> need<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:33.090> tend<00:04:33.630> it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
the composition so we need to tend it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.320 
the composition so we need to tend it
very<00:04:34.199> powerfully<00:04:34.949> so<00:04:35.370> otherwise<00:04:35.789> it<00:04:36.060> will<00:04:36.150> not

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
very powerfully so otherwise it will not

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.760 
very powerfully so otherwise it will not
sustain<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:37.139> fruit<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.490> different<00:04:39.060> style<00:04:39.330> of

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
sustain the fruit the different style of

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.080 
sustain the fruit the different style of
outlined<00:04:40.770> fruit<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:43.190> end<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.760> fruit

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
outlined fruit and the end of the fruit

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.939 
outlined fruit and the end of the fruit
we<00:04:45.449> call<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:46.130> remains<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.430> style<00:04:48.949> atomically

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
we call it remains of style atomically

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.990 
we call it remains of style atomically
so<00:04:50.370> that's<00:04:50.789> very<00:04:51.330> characteristic<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.380> this

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
so that's very characteristic of this

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.649 
so that's very characteristic of this
specific<00:04:54.000> fruit<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.930> very<00:04:55.139> juicy<00:04:55.919> fruit

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
specific fruit it's a very juicy fruit
