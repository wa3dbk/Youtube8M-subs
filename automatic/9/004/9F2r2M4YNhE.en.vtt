 new console you released everything there is no 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.150
 long time 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:14.340
 finally, if at the end of 2013 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:16.200
 joints and bah of the blow here is loved 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.040
 loads they are extremely dense 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.890
 intrigues of patients here in basel has 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.820
 gone but what is it then I'm going 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:37.709
 race with you super car 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:42.660
 voice is asked knowing that there the car 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:47.250
 running and see a little pale to use 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.520
 in the races and everything and that's it 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.410
 boring but hey and sasha to have it 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.030
 fails to win all races 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.610
 so the jv legay explains to you that he 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.380
 wants to do a race with you and where 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.440
 you can not choose it in the debarked 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.580
 early so long there I will not try 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.989
 talk too much for this withdrawal here 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.989
 must pass in reverse cows 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:23.139
 knowing that the first races down 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.330
 are way too easy and the last 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:39.610
 can not say they are hard but 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:39.610
 anyway 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.050
 So here we come to win the 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.660
 race and after ben have to go in the 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.120
 waters of delay all if you are in if 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.650
 you have all the characters and where 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.810
 finally also you will unlock all 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.820
 the cities so I do not want to do it 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.050
 because otherwise the video had lasted 20 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.120
 minutes treats like that so go 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.570
 bye bye meet for a new 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.570
