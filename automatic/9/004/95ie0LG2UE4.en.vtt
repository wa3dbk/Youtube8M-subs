that<00:01:13.830> killed<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> new

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that killed and you don't get the new

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
title you have to get a nuclear with

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
title you have to get a nuclear with
only<00:01:17.700> gun<00:01:17.970> kills<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.420> 30<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.869> before<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
only gun kills go 30 know before the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
only gun kills go 30 know before the
game<00:01:19.500> ends<00:01:19.820> personally<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
game ends personally I think it's one of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.640 
game ends personally I think it's one of
the<00:01:21.450> hardest<00:01:21.570> titles<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> game<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> get

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the hardest titles in the game to get

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
the hardest titles in the game to get

but it's sick once we get it now the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
but it's sick once we get it now the
biggest<00:01:24.990> thing<00:01:25.140> he<00:01:25.290> does<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> helps<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.040> get

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
gotta figure there's eight people

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.249 
gotta figure there's eight people
playing<00:01:41.070> free-for-all<00:01:41.579> I'm<00:01:41.909> most<00:01:42.210> times<00:01:42.509> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
playing free-for-all I'm most times so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.569 
playing free-for-all I'm most times so
the<00:01:43.409> spawns<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.130> quite<00:01:44.369> hectic

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the spawns are going to be quite hectic

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.219 
the spawns are going to be quite hectic
and<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.030> could<00:01:45.240> spawn<00:01:45.450> behind<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.020> front

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
and they could spawn behind you in front

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.539 
and they could spawn behind you in front
of<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.409> next<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.250> could<00:01:47.369> spawn

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of you next to you they could spawn

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.210 
of you next to you they could spawn
anywhere<00:01:47.909> at<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.420> times<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.229> any<00:01:49.380> time<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
anywhere at all times at any time so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.670 
anywhere at all times at any time so
that's<00:01:50.399> why<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.579> run<00:01:50.970> UAV<00:01:51.570> counter<00:01:51.960> UAV<00:01:52.140> be

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that's why you run UAV counter UAV be

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
that's why you run UAV counter UAV be
set<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> reason<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.520> counter<00:01:53.759> UAVs<00:01:54.180> because

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
set the reason for counter UAVs because

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.999 
set the reason for counter UAVs because
it's<00:01:54.689> not<00:01:54.780> running<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.140> silencer<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it's not running a silencer so when I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's not running a silencer so when I
counter<00:01:56.280> UAV<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.600> can't

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
counter UAV is up they actually can't

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
counter UAV is up they actually can't
see<00:01:57.990> him<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.290> radar<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
see him on the radar you know if you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.140 
see him on the radar you know if you
guys<00:01:59.549> want<00:01:59.850> you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
guys want you

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.580 
guys want you
run<00:02:00.270> silencer<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.020> wouldn't<00:02:01.260> have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> run

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
run silencer you wouldn't have to run

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.290 
run silencer you wouldn't have to run
counter<00:02:01.890> UAV<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.580> run<00:02:02.730> a<00:02:02.760> guardian<00:02:03.210> but

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
counter UAV you could run a guardian but

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.970 
counter UAV you could run a guardian but
