it to me well all you have to do is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.380 
it to me well all you have to do is
think<00:00:15.780> about<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.440> teaching<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
think about what you are teaching and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
think about what you are teaching and
afterwards<00:00:18.390> don't<00:00:19.109> think<00:00:19.380> about<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
afterwards don't think about how the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.580 
afterwards don't think about how the
lesson<00:00:20.400> went<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.449> called<00:00:21.810> reflection<00:00:22.470> in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
lesson went it's called reflection in

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.400 
lesson went it's called reflection in
action<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.070> reflection<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.850> action<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:25.019> helps

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
action and reflection on action it helps

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.689 
action and reflection on action it helps
you<00:00:25.529> learn<00:00:25.740> what<00:00:26.010> works<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.550> doesn't

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
you learn what works and what doesn't

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.480 
you learn what works and what doesn't
and<00:00:27.240> how<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> change<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.560> think<00:00:28.980> reflection

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and how to change it I think reflection

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
and how to change it I think reflection
prior<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.910> instruction<00:00:30.420> would<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.660> most

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
prior to instruction would be most

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
prior to instruction would be most
useful<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.099> increase<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
useful because it would increase the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
useful because it would increase the
subject<00:00:32.969> matter<00:00:33.180> knowledge<00:00:33.270> prior<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
subject matter knowledge prior to the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.760 
subject matter knowledge prior to the
lesson<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.590> agree<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:36.270> example<00:00:36.840> understanding

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
lesson I agree for example understanding

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530 
lesson I agree for example understanding
about<00:00:37.890> content<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> specific<00:00:39.030> academic

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
about content in a specific academic

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
about content in a specific academic
area<00:00:40.290> such<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.800> history<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.149> would

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
area such as history I think it would

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
area such as history I think it would
help<00:00:42.420> most<00:00:42.809> by<00:00:43.260> focusing<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.890> curricular

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
help most by focusing on curricular

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
help most by focusing on curricular
subject<00:00:44.730> matter<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.329> reflecting<00:00:45.899> on

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
subject matter and reflecting on

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.130 
subject matter and reflecting on
misunderstandings<00:00:46.879> touche<00:00:47.879> I've<00:00:48.510> also<00:00:48.930> found

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
misunderstandings touche I've also found

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
misunderstandings touche I've also found
that<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.010> helps<00:00:50.280> transform<00:00:50.730> subject<00:00:51.360> matter

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that it helps transform subject matter

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.959 
that it helps transform subject matter
into<00:00:51.960> pedagogy<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> knowledge<00:00:53.789> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
into pedagogy which is the knowledge of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
into pedagogy which is the knowledge of
how<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> teach<00:00:54.510> certain<00:00:54.840> subject<00:00:55.469> matter<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
how to teach certain subject matter I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
how to teach certain subject matter I
have<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.670> figure<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.480> went<00:00:57.719> wrong<00:00:57.809> with

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
have to figure out what went wrong with

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
have to figure out what went wrong with
one<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> my<00:00:58.739> lessons<00:00:59.250> today<00:00:59.489> why<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
one of my lessons today why would you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
one of my lessons today why would you
want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.160> when<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.280> done<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
want to do that when I'm done with a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
want to do that when I'm done with a
lesson<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.180> done<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.930> rarely<00:01:04.739> change<00:01:05.189> anything

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
lesson I'm done I rarely change anything

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.640 
lesson I'm done I rarely change anything
with<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:05.850> lesson<00:01:06.210> plans<00:01:06.479> unless<00:01:06.930> something

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
with my lesson plans unless something

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070 
with my lesson plans unless something
major<00:01:07.680> goes<00:01:08.070> wrong<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.330> always<00:01:09.750> am

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
major goes wrong really I always am

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
major goes wrong really I always am
reflecting<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.770> ways<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.460> change<00:01:11.700> my

reflecting on ways I can change my
lessons<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.720> may<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.520> work

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
lessons I may think it is going to work

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
lessons I may think it is going to work
out<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.210> paper<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.080> men<00:01:16.350> sometimes<00:01:16.680> the

out on paper but men sometimes the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
out on paper but men sometimes the
perfect<00:01:17.610> lesson<00:01:17.820> plan<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.479> paper<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:19.350> blow<00:01:19.590> up

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
perfect lesson plan on paper can blow up

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
perfect lesson plan on paper can blow up
in<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:19.920> face<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.640> long<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> tell<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.689> what

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
is needed to be known I just leave it at

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
is needed to be known I just leave it at
that<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.600> must<00:01:24.869> spend<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> lot<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> time

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that you must spend a lot of time

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
that you must spend a lot of time
redoing<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.310> lesson<00:01:26.640> plans<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.630> kids

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
redoing you lesson plans if your kids

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
redoing you lesson plans if your kids
are<00:01:27.960> anything<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.470> mine<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.759> take<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
are anything like mine it might take a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
are anything like mine it might take a
little<00:01:30.299> longer<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.930> normal<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:32.070> my

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
little longer than normal but I want my

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
little longer than normal but I want my
students<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> understand<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> material<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
students to understand the material to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
students to understand the material to
the<00:01:34.740> fullest<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> takes<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.990> little

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the fullest so what if it takes a little

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.649 
the fullest so what if it takes a little
more<00:01:37.320> effort<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.009> part<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.420> teaching

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
more effort on my part we are teaching

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.649 
more effort on my part we are teaching
our<00:01:39.930> future<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.329> students

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
our future so if one of your students

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.240 
our future so if one of your students
doesn't<00:01:43.020> understand<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> spend<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.040> time

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
doesn't understand you spend more time

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920 
doesn't understand you spend more time
with<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.640> even<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> rest<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> class
