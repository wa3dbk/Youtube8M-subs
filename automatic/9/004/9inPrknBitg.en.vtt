00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
very cold so I'm gonna go through it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.670 
very cold so I'm gonna go through it
quite<00:00:38.070> quickly<00:00:38.360> this<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.200> rain

gauge okay this here off this here this
little<00:00:45.570> page<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.059> frozen<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:48.780> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
little page it's just frozen in there so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
little page it's just frozen in there so
time<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
time to take it out this little this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
time to take it out this little this
little<00:00:51.780> cage<00:00:52.230> prevents<00:00:52.770> bugs<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:59.219> rain

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
little cage prevents bugs and the rain

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.020 
little cage prevents bugs and the rain
gauge<00:00:59.670> doesn't<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.030> clogged<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.699> new

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
gauge doesn't get clogged this is a new

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.119 
gauge doesn't get clogged this is a new
feature<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> I've<00:01:03.750> never<00:01:03.899> had<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.379> any<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.040> my

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
feature that I've never had on any of my

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
feature that I've never had on any of my
other<00:01:05.280> stations<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> solar

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
other stations this here is a solar

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.039 
other stations this here is a solar
panel<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> facing<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> south<00:01:09.810> which

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
panel now this is facing the south which

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
panel now this is facing the south which
is<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.439> way<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.640> does<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> picks

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
is this way and what it does is it picks

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.499 
is this way and what it does is it picks
up<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> solar<00:01:12.930> radiation<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.130> uses<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
up the solar radiation and uses that and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
up the solar radiation and uses that and
translates<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.200> power<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.520> got

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
translates it into power so I've got

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
translates it into power so I've got
batteries<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.600> already<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
batteries that are already in here but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.670 
batteries that are already in here but
what<00:01:19.890> does<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.460> uses<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.420> takes<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
what does is it uses it it takes up it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
what does is it uses it it takes up it
turns<00:01:22.920> off<00:01:23.130> those<00:01:23.340> batteries<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> use<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
turns off those batteries and use the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.399 
turns off those batteries and use the
solar<00:01:24.960> power<00:01:25.290> instead<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> neat

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
solar power instead now this is a neat

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
solar power instead now this is a neat
little<00:01:28.439> feature<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> bubble<00:01:30.180> level

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
little feature this is a bubble level

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.780 
little feature this is a bubble level
this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> level<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.610> out

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this is what I use to level it out

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
this is what I use to level it out
unfortunately<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.530> not

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
unfortunately it's right now it's not

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
unfortunately it's right now it's not
right<00:01:35.250> dead<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> center<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
right dead in the center but it is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.010 
right dead in the center but it is
pretty<00:01:37.079> close<00:01:38.090> all<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.750> here

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
pretty close all right so here we here

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
pretty close all right so here we here
we<00:01:40.140> go<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> cool<00:01:40.710> stuff<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
we go with the cool stuff this here is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.380 
we go with the cool stuff this here is
your<00:01:41.729> Amana<00:01:42.380> anemometer<00:01:43.520> okay<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.090> what

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
your Amana anemometer okay this is what

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
your Amana anemometer okay this is what
measures<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.439> wind<00:01:46.619> speed<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.149> then

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
measures your wind speed and out then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.889 
measures your wind speed and out then
this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.930> also<00:01:49.140> helps<00:01:49.500> calculate<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
this is what also helps calculate the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.819 
this is what also helps calculate the
wind<00:01:51.899> chill<00:01:52.640> okay<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:55.409> these<00:01:55.590> vents

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
wind chill okay in here from these vents

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.300 
wind chill okay in here from these vents
right<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.969> your<00:01:58.009> temperature<00:01:59.009> your

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
right here this is your temperature your

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.910 
right here this is your temperature your

your<00:02:02.219> whole<00:02:02.430> deal<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> air<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.439> that's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
your whole deal with the air and that's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
your whole deal with the air and that's
where<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.219> measure<00:02:05.430> your<00:02:05.520> temperature<00:02:05.670> this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
where you measure your temperature this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.320 
where you measure your temperature this
here<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.200> wind<00:02:07.409> direction<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.489> it's

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
here is your wind direction and it's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.290 
here is your wind direction and it's
been<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.080> been<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.819> spotty<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:11.970> out
