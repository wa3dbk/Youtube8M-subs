00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the British lions tour and and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.270
 neil a big surprise in june 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.340
 these parties kickoff hit by 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 wisniewski and the racing leads in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.929
 arm of stephen armitage 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.020
 as said like halo quesada this 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.100
 week it is imperative to avoid that the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.100
 machine does not start 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.820
 if so much is fast on wilkinson but 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 kingson launches bass duras and mathieu 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.330
 bastareaud who pursues everything done 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 the Swiss he is resumed unless his 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 mastery falls belted by matt anigo 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.960
 this is the first test opportunity of this 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 match in favor of Toulon but rented the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 line durand and cars 2 hard for my zoe 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.860
 masoe bounces on ben arous 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.190
 big breakthrough of bastareaud and action 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.719
 which continues 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.089
 with jean-pierre armitage for the greens 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.769
 the ship the other the last names will be 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.519
 a penalty not reported sir lafon 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.730
 first big action of the match him who 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.940
 will escape skis back 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.020
 of a comfortable esteban a little too late and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.020
 the machine that is launched 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.160
 he was going to turn his head he hesitates to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 forward that balloon while he's a 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.560
 support we do not see it but they get 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.930
 hold on his right 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.060
 he is finally stopped with difficulty 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 and then having them then will insist 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 same meaning with again this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 power characteristics to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
 the irish have english jonny 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.380
 wilkinson equalizes 3-3 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.280
 machenaud same meaning on grindr 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.350
 now the Argentine international 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.610
 gallineau well taken by haguy early but 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 open to the overthrow of machenaud 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.900
 with gerondeau now gérondeau pris 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.979
 to legs by imane same meaning again 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.770
 for the right maybe jonathan 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.869
 wisniewski is gone and this drop of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.120
 wisniewski passes between the poles 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.860
 the oaci does not equalize six points in any 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.570
 so i have good and bernard laporte va 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.280
 enjoy the trajectory in porto 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.860
 careful of quite dangerous with 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 my book follow and masoe who save 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.790
 the test that does not concede to the scrum at 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.740
 five 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.310
 machenaud for wisniewski on the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.080
 Outside 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.520
 estevan shows two hunted by 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.440
 bastareaud and escapes him estebanez who 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.210
 pay what still escapes the task 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.330
 will go to score taken in extremis - 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.390
 ankle support and that is the test 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.130
 subway racing the third which separate 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.770
 Toulouse this season on the lawn of 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.000
 mayol look all not here there is a 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.320
 situation of three against two he goes 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.150
 try framing overflow on 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.820
 bastareaud the succeed esteban she is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.100
 there the physical power of the old 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.410
 Brive that escapes two tackles and 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.600
 who allows himself in defense 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.920
 toulonnaise to serve beautifully his 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.880
 henry chavancy compliment the one at 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.680
 departure of the action the framing 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.750
 overflow on bastareaud he escapes 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.570
 then at david smith he is recovered 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.340
 the extremist by hermitage and wilkinson 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.370
 who trunk chavancy rats too late pitau 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.650
 who falls and kitchen outside and what 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080
 jersey is hit show is business 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.940
 which guito advantage going on for the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.790
 toulonnais feint pass smith caught 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.690
 by the defense of racing and sir 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.690
 lafon returns the penalty 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:24.040
 will go exactly 998 points 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.610
 in Toulon jonny jersey 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.280
 wilkinson 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.630
 but what's important at 7 minutes is 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.020
 know that would bring it closer it was a 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.710

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.370
 with 10 of the lones to help rite that seems 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.010
 fonterra prepares the plating of 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.470
 wisniewski just five meters from 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.449
 the aim of racing metro mermoz 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.949
 half melee potion hunt is belted 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.680
 by estevan and this while the siren 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.570

 the first time of the season and bernard 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.699
 Laporte has just learned in his 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.919
 cloakroom went to the end of themselves 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:48.400
 and the exceptional effort at the end of 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.949
 match by defense see with fabrice 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.840
 estebanez completely exhausted match 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.250

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.280
 to fall the leader who was a lived here 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.750
 I can not believe it again with the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.960
 correlate the difficult times that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.960

 they have they played very very good this 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:07.960
 evening with a lot of fact and it was 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.240
 hard for known to these two we are very 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.460
 disappointed but 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.569
 we will work we will work 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.379
 have to win again and 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.300
 yeah we did not have to be here once so 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:22.149
 it's not the only one 1 will have hands 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.909
 likewise absent and it's not over 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.209
 definitely took my congratulations 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.289

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:30.490
 they are very very good tonight thank you I 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.159
 we would be with dimitri szarzewski 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.809
 the captain of the real racing feat 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.449
 can you build 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:39.279
 after that kind of success you're 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.139
 went deep inside 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.949
 I hope that tonight we show 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.369
 we are able to make beautiful 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.289
 things tonight there was a beautiful 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:48.099
 solidarity 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.659
 we knew it was very difficult 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.639
 but we knew how to do it now 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.349
 not ignite loudly and it remained a 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.219
 blog continues to train well because 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:54.550
 that he pays us short of fat 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.740
 deadlines 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.559
 the recipe for coming here to win 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.240
 so really to attack Toulon 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:02.439
 yes that's the answer to the challenge 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.300
 physical I think that would not go 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.649
 god we had a big defense we are 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.860
 went up looking for them we won a few 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:10.149
 impacts we were disciplined so a 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.429
 beautiful conquest again tonight 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.929
 yes these ingredients to beat the 

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:15.009
 best teams even though tonight 

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.199
 Toulon can be a little bit 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.569
 in but yes we are really going 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.899
 really savor this victory and then 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:23.889
 we will then begin to move to the 16th 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:25.209
 final that awaits us in front of 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.009
 Saracens and next integration 

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:29.559
 thanks dimitri and then come because she 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.719
 risk of being complicated it was said and 

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:33.249
 repeated huge debauchery of energy tonight 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:36.309
 where you have created a real feat 

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:38.829
 you had come for that we were 

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:40.809
 especially come to measure themselves to the most 

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:42.999
 beautiful team of this championship and I 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.889
 believe we did it with the 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:45.849
 heart we did not give up it is true that 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.979
 we held them well after half time 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:49.389
 despite the fact that we bypass with 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:51.490
 three points behind and I think we 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:52.899
 to let go of his skis is what has 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.099
 changed compared to water dating 

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.209
 last year either but this 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.079
 back and play -off where we had 

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:57.399
 cracked in second half 

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:58.809
 I think we cracked them 

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:00.279
 So we are very happy tonight 

00:07:58.809 --> 00:08:02.979
 a click for racing 

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.909
 in view of this end of season ben I 

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:05.889
 do not know if it's a click that would 

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:06.969
 from so low we have then we are 

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:07.930
 able to lose against the last to 

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:09.490
 home and we are able to go 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.419
 win against the first to 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.279
 outside so it's a little bit 

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:13.419
 paradox of racing this year but good 

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.349
 I think that's what puts us on 

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:17.789
 good bases in any case for the 

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:17.789
 second part of the season thank you very much
