00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.089
 it is something personal that assists the mathematician 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.099
 who you are talking to. 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.829
 Professor fernando Grings 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:23.060
 in this video we will continue the 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:26.300
 clinging paws and had shown a video 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.040
 past some properties in a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.290
 I'm going to draw attention to them. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.160
 that I have an exercise that in my 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.190
 front and the property that I am 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.469
 Seeing that I can fit myself in, I'm 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.400
 even in a way wanting to find 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:47.450
 in her because she is very simple x on tv 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.890
 happens that the x nassim is under the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.390
 denominator 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.220
 so I have to make it 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.800
 pass to the dominator 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.950
 I'm going to give a neighboring property there 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.809
 our 8th series which says that the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.880
 will lead to - p 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.920
 It's the same as none about the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.950
 high on the tv then this property 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.520
 neighbor I'm going to use says I have 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.979
 that passing the xis in 5 is down to 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.810
 as long as I change the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:31.159
 exponent and then our function nef kg of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.759
 xo-3 that is on top sees it x at least 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.520
 so that's where the novelty goes. 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.829
 using that neighboring property 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.729
 It was not right, we 're halfway through. 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.069
 forgotten where I'm remembering 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:50.719
 here in the case we now fit into 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:52.369
 xis in lost Chinese well and does not matter 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.279
 Negative commitment 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:03.950
 all that I have to do in this 

00:01:55.279 --> 00:02:06.229
 time is to write and genre dx equal 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 the stretch that our constant that is 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.160
 multiplying the continuous function 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.739
 multiplying these five times as 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 are those with the race ahead 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.500
 Remember the front here and there on top of that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.830
 getting into one is going to be less 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.260
 times x or less five that was there in 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.850
 up - one feitinho sound now we just have 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:43.460
 who perform what is in front of us 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:50.030
 35 negative of the g line of x equal to 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:53.690
 at least fifteen times x on -6 rock 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.270
 now to end these six negative 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.680
 teachers do not like it to be 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.080
 negative 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.140
 we will respond in the same way 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.400
 that we received 1 x high number 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 positive 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.600
 so just go down again and 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.110
 change the ending 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:19.490
 then g will give x minus 15 line stays 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.260
 up and down will stay high x in the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.070
 six more 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.620
 we find a derivative we will move to 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.480
 another exercise a little bit more 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.480
 more complex work 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:40.220
 this exercise has a sum of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.070
 3x functions on a5 which is very easy 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.390
 two men x high on the 4 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.450
 both exercises years the situations me 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.959
 I remember x na p 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.820
 This one is x napende grandson is already this 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.580
 here you have to go up using 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.560
 that neighboring property that people 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.980
 He saw the 8th grade 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.390
 I've put it next to it, and that's what the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.769
 people will have to use it and after that then 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.900
 we copy the function again this 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.650
 I will not do anything because she already 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.600
 exactly congenital is ready 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.150
 but I will not decide yet I will 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:30.080
 to fix this one that will stay with 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.440
 at least 2 times x on the -4 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.960
 up using 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.540
 a little bit now finally the people 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.340
 fell in the case of x on p 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.730
 If I put it here for you, you can 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:50.250
 bar x elevated as soon as the xis in pe-15 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.910
 at least four also 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.520
 p ii both cases and I will pass the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.420
 number forward and subtract one from there 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.700
 top 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.750
 I'll pass this number forward and 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.740
 sudden no discipline applying I 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:14.720
 I have hdx the derivative will be the chicken 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:24.240
 x 3 times 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:28.250
 5x in the 5 - 1 - 2 times that are here 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:33.740
 minus four that slides forward x 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:37.350
 na - 4 - a ok all i did was 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.580
 to apply this here was rule forward 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.830
 and subtracting maximum in both situations 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.230
 now that I have everything ready it 's from 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.900
 is already defined 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.430
 what I have to do have to fix 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.110
 That's it for a little bit more 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.990
 lean response 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:05.780
 here for example three of five and 15 and x 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:11.510
 in 5 - 1 and 4 - 2 times less 4 is more 8 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:14.580
 x at least 5 and again an exponent 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.130
 negative teachers do not like that 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.169
 these spies from negative then to 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.220
 People are going to use this here to move on. 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:27.080
 with positive exponent exists in the 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:34.230
 At least 5 passes down will stay the 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:36.449
 chicken x equals 15 x high on 4 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.319
 but eight 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:43.379
 / x on five more 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.229
 then that is the satisfactory answer that 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.449
 any teacher will accept a 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.999
 I hope you guys have enjoyed a 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.409
 Next video I'll do more exercises 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:54.900
 of derivatives 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.539
 I ask you to help me by clicking on 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.729
 positive on social networks 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.659
 this way you are pres- 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.819
 my work 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.770
 if you want to keep informed of the 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.240
 videos I'm posting sign up 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.159
 my channel 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.810
 then to the next video with more 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.810
 private exercises
