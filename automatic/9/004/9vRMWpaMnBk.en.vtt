without the diffuser I'm going to put

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.900 
without the diffuser I'm going to put
the<00:02:21.209> diffuser<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.870> now<00:02:22.110> see<00:02:23.010> what<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.280> does

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the diffuser on now see what that does

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.580

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
just so you know I have my light right

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.500 
just so you know I have my light right
now<00:02:25.650> set<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.660> eight<00:02:27.660> power<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.970> my<00:02:29.970> zoom<00:02:30.269> is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
now set at eight power and my zoom is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.280 
now set at eight power and my zoom is
sixteen<00:02:30.989> millimeter<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:33.330> camera<00:02:33.870> I'll<00:02:34.140> have

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
sixteen millimeter the camera I'll have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.960 
sixteen millimeter the camera I'll have
to<00:02:34.410> go<00:02:34.709> over<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> camera<00:02:35.220> settings<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.670> I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
to go over the camera settings I think I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.220 
to go over the camera settings I think I
have<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.299> f9<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:38.569> one<00:02:39.569> hundredth<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
have it on f9 at one hundredth of a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.430 
have it on f9 at one hundredth of a
second<00:02:40.940> probably<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> two<00:02:42.269> hundred<00:02:42.420> ISO<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.290> my

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
second probably a two hundred ISO is my

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.309 
second probably a two hundred ISO is my
guess<00:02:43.799> again<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.150> put<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.390> I'll<00:02:45.870> make
