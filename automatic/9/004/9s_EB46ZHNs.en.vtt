00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.270 
feels almost like dirt so if you have
something<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
something like this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.410 
something like this
we're<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> shovel<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
we're just going to shovel out the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
we're just going to shovel out the
contents<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.140> I'm<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
contents and I'm going to put it in a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.359 
contents and I'm going to put it in a
garbage<00:01:02.789> bag

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.819 

so<00:01:07.299> as<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:07.600> can<00:01:07.689> see<00:01:07.750> I'm<00:01:08.079> mixing<00:01:08.409> it<00:01:08.530> around

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
so as you can see I'm mixing it around

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.139 
so as you can see I'm mixing it around
in<00:01:09.009> here<00:01:09.219> and<00:01:09.340> I'm<00:01:09.399> getting<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.729> dirt<00:01:09.969> loose

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
in here and I'm getting the dirt loose

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.800 
in here and I'm getting the dirt loose
and<00:01:10.450> instead<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.380> shoveling<00:01:11.890> everything<00:01:12.280> out

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and instead of shoveling everything out

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.910 
and instead of shoveling everything out
you<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:13.929> want<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.200> get<00:01:14.289> everything<00:01:14.560> loose

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
you just want to get everything loose

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.130 
you just want to get everything loose
then<00:01:15.759> just<00:01:15.969> pick<00:01:16.179> it<00:01:16.210> up<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.539> dump<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.929> in<00:01:17.049> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
then just pick it up and dump it in the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.959 
then just pick it up and dump it in the
bag<00:01:17.319> and<00:01:17.619> that'll<00:01:18.250> be<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.369> lot<00:01:18.520> easier<00:01:18.579> than

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
bag and that'll be a lot easier than

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.740 
bag and that'll be a lot easier than
shoveling<00:01:19.420> out<00:01:19.539> everything

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
and we're gonna let it sit for probably

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.780 
and we're gonna let it sit for probably
an<00:02:14.060> hour<00:02:14.410> half<00:02:15.410> an<00:02:15.500> hour<00:02:15.650> an<00:02:16.010> hour<00:02:16.130> around

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
an hour half an hour an hour around

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.430 
an hour half an hour an hour around
there<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.210> next<00:02:17.840> we're<00:02:17.930> going<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.110> work<00:02:18.230> on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
there and next we're going to work on

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.460 
there and next we're going to work on
the<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.890> filter<00:02:19.610> over<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:19.990> already<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.230> for

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the the filter over here already so for

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680 
the the filter over here already so for
your<00:02:21.560> filter<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.640> bottom<00:02:23.030> part<00:02:23.150> does<00:02:23.510> not

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
your filter this bottom part does not

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.300 
your filter this bottom part does not
come<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.440> try<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.740> mess<00:02:25.070> with<00:02:25.160> that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
come out so don't try to mess with that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.340 
come out so don't try to mess with that
plastic<00:02:25.730> otherwise<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.240> break<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.600> so

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
plastic otherwise you can break it so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.710 
plastic otherwise you can break it so
you<00:02:27.440> have<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.620> manually<00:02:28.070> get<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.630> filter<00:02:29.630> off

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
you have to manually get the filter off

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.910 
you have to manually get the filter off
in<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> outside<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.320> have<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.530> pull<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.860> out

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
in the outside you have to pull it out

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.820 
in the outside you have to pull it out
and<00:02:31.160> lift<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.730> all<00:02:32.510> these<00:02:32.660> sides<00:02:33.530> over<00:02:33.740> here

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
and lift up on all these sides over here

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.590 
and lift up on all these sides over here
and<00:02:34.100> eventually<00:02:34.280> it'll<00:02:34.670> come<00:02:34.790> out<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.450> right

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
and eventually it'll come out all right

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.540 
and eventually it'll come out all right
so<00:02:35.780> now<00:02:35.960> it's<00:02:35.990> out<00:02:36.320> there<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.100> definitely<00:02:37.520> a

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
so now it's out there is definitely a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.520 
so now it's out there is definitely a
lot<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.670> dust<00:02:37.910> your<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.240> write<00:02:38.420> BNE<00:02:39.290> for

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
lot of dust your I can write BNE for

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.670 
lot of dust your I can write BNE for
Ben's<00:02:39.680> garage<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.370> there<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.270> this<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:42.320> shake

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
Ben's garage on there and this you shake

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
Ben's garage on there and this you shake
it<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.800> little<00:02:42.830> bit<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.220> dust<00:02:43.400> will<00:02:43.550> fly

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
it a little bit and dust will fly

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.280 
it a little bit and dust will fly
everywhere<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.660> we're<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.960> put<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
everywhere so we're going to put the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.860 
everywhere so we're going to put the
hose<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.800> one<00:02:46.270> adjust<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.300> hose<00:02:47.480> for<00:02:47.750> now

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
hose on this one adjust the hose for now

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.980 
hose on this one adjust the hose for now
the<00:02:48.500> bleach<00:02:48.680> will<00:02:48.890> probably<00:02:49.600> really<00:02:50.600> hurt<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
the bleach will probably really hurt the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.450 
the bleach will probably really hurt the
filter<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.680> little<00:02:51.770> bit<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.070> wear<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.430> a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
filter a little bit and wear it out a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.300 
filter a little bit and wear it out a
lot<00:02:52.760> easier<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.930> we're<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.680> gonna<00:02:54.920> wash<00:02:55.100> out

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
lot easier so we're just gonna wash out

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.980 
lot easier so we're just gonna wash out
the<00:02:55.460> filter<00:02:55.730> with<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.910> hose<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.360> then<00:02:56.780> we'll

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
the filter with the hose and then we'll

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.070 
the filter with the hose and then we'll
come<00:02:57.140> back<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.560> part<00:03:01.600> now<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.810> looks<00:03:02.959> a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
come back to this part now it looks a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.750 
come back to this part now it looks a
lot<00:03:03.200> better<00:03:03.260> than<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.800> did<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.250> know<00:03:04.520> it's

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
lot better than what it did I know it's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.400 
lot better than what it did I know it's
wet<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.240> if<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.570> cringe<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.020> none<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
wet and if you cringe it none of the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500 
wet and if you cringe it none of the
dust<00:03:06.590> will<00:03:06.800> fly<00:03:06.980> but<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> majority<00:03:08.240> of

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
dust will fly but now the majority of

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.000 
dust will fly but now the majority of
the<00:03:08.660> dust<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:08.990> off<00:03:09.140> because<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.560> water<00:03:09.800> took

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
the dust is off because the water took

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.580 
the dust is off because the water took
it<00:03:10.130> away<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:11.810> actually<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.170> nice<00:03:12.350> new

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
it away so this is actually a nice new

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.830 
it away so this is actually a nice new
clean<00:03:12.860> filter<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.430> can<00:03:13.580> reuse<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.720> now

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
clean filter that we can reuse so now

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.900 
clean filter that we can reuse so now
once<00:03:15.050> you've<00:03:15.200> let<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.440> soak<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:15.890> while<00:03:16.040> if

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
once you've let it soak for a while if

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.400 
once you've let it soak for a while if
you're<00:03:17.060> outside<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.690> find<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.959> sewer<00:03:18.170> gate

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
you're outside just find a sewer gate

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
something just we got to get rid of all

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.340 
something just we got to get rid of all
this<00:03:23.209> water<00:03:23.450> inside<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.780> then<00:03:24.050> we'll<00:03:24.170> go<00:03:24.320> down

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
this water inside and then we'll go down

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.110 
this water inside and then we'll go down
and<00:03:24.530> start<00:03:24.890> scrubbing<00:03:25.190> all<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.610> crap<00:03:25.910> off

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
all right so now at least it looks a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.470 
all right so now at least it looks a
little<00:03:28.130> better<00:03:28.340> than<00:03:28.580> before<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.150> we<00:03:29.269> still

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
little better than before but we still

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.500 
the bottom and on the sides alrighty
guys<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:54.170> now<00:03:54.890> on<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.310> inside<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:56.450> a

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
guys so now on the inside it's a it's a

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.790 
guys so now on the inside it's a it's a
lot<00:03:56.660> better<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.170> can<00:03:57.290> see<00:03:57.440> some<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.739> the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
lot better you can see some of the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.759 
lot better you can see some of the
original<00:03:58.300> shiny<00:03:59.300> metal<00:03:59.690> over<00:04:00.170> on<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.380> area

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
original shiny metal over on this area

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.310 
original shiny metal over on this area
but<00:04:01.459> actually<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> rest<00:04:02.230> unfortunately<00:04:03.230> is

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
but actually the rest unfortunately is

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.100 
but actually the rest unfortunately is
rust<00:04:03.590> buildup<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.220> there's<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.030> big<00:04:05.390> walkin

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
rust buildup and there's a big walkin

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.520 
rust buildup and there's a big walkin
hole<00:04:06.320> right<00:04:06.500> here<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.600> it's<00:04:08.600> all<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:09.170> all

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
hole right here and it's all it's all

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.949 
hole right here and it's all it's all
just<00:04:09.769> building<00:04:10.130> up<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:11.000> if<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.660> do<00:04:11.780> have<00:04:11.930> a

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
just building up so if you do have a

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.470 
just building up so if you do have a
hole<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.709> metal<00:04:13.340> one<00:04:13.459> like<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.790> JB<00:04:14.269> walled

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
hole in a metal one like this JB walled

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.970 
hole in a metal one like this JB walled
will<00:04:14.660> do<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:15.790> Gorilla<00:04:16.790> Glue<00:04:16.970> would<00:04:17.150> do<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.980> but

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
will do it Gorilla Glue would do it but

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.900 
will do it Gorilla Glue would do it but
you<00:04:19.040> just<00:04:19.100> want<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.400> make<00:04:19.519> sure<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.700> get<00:04:19.820> those

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
you just want to make sure you get those

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.199 
you just want to make sure you get those
hole

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
hole

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.120 
hole
covered<00:04:20.449> up<00:04:20.570> because<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.590> suction<00:04:22.009> will

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
covered up because the suction will

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.270 
covered up because the suction will
actually<00:04:23.050> will<00:04:24.050> spread<00:04:24.470> out<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.770> cracks<00:04:25.070> and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
actually will spread out the cracks and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.760 
actually will spread out the cracks and
will<00:04:25.400> make<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.639> hole<00:04:25.820> bigger<00:04:26.360> actually<00:04:26.770> so

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
will make the hole bigger actually so

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.580 
will make the hole bigger actually so
that's<00:04:28.759> on<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.000> inside<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.389> also<00:04:29.840> hosed<00:04:30.410> off

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
that's on the inside I also hosed off

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.990 
that's on the inside I also hosed off
the<00:04:30.770> outside<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:31.370> now<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.639> looks<00:04:31.789> a<00:04:31.880> little

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
the outside so now it looks a little

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.540 
the outside so now it looks a little
better<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:33.050> now<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.710> think<00:04:33.889> our<00:04:34.100> filter<00:04:34.460> has

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
better and now I think our filter has

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.670 
better and now I think our filter has
dried<00:04:34.759> up<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.090> we're<00:04:35.630> going<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:35.780> we're<00:04:36.560> going

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
dried up and we're going to we're going

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.260 
dried up and we're going to we're going
to<00:04:36.800> wash<00:04:36.949> off<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.370> all<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.639> plastic<00:04:38.090> stuff

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
to wash off like all the plastic stuff

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.120 
to wash off like all the plastic stuff
that<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.539> filter<00:04:38.900> surrounded<00:04:39.320> then<00:04:39.949> we<00:04:40.009> want

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
that the filter surrounded then we want

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.279 
that the filter surrounded then we want
to<00:04:40.190> put<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.400> back<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.699> alright<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.810> got<00:04:42.080> the

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
to put it back in alright so I got the

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.409 
to put it back in alright so I got the
underneath<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.190> filter<00:04:43.520> back<00:04:43.759> on<00:04:43.789> and

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
underneath and the filter back on and

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.600 
underneath and the filter back on and
everything<00:04:45.410> is<00:04:45.530> nice<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:45.949> washed<00:04:46.190> out<00:04:46.460> and

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
everything is nice and washed out and

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.219 
everything is nice and washed out and
clean<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.389> now<00:04:47.509> I'm<00:04:47.600> just<00:04:47.720> going<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.930> put<00:04:48.110> it

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
clean so now I'm just going to put it

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.520 
clean so now I'm just going to put it
back<00:04:48.860> over<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.690> we're<00:04:50.690> just<00:04:50.780> going<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.169> clamp

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
back over and we're just going to clamp
