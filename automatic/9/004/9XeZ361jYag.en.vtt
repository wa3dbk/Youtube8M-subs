999 at my beauty supply store anyway it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.399 
999 at my beauty supply store anyway it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
really didn't matter on the color

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
really didn't matter on the color
because<00:01:22.740> usually<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.729> lighter<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> color

was<00:03:07.510> install<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.980> much<00:03:09.400> more<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:10.000> tightly

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
was install it is much more like tightly

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.680 
was install it is much more like tightly
curled<00:03:11.170> when<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.590> install<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.069> but<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.180> rate<00:03:13.540> I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
curled when you install it but I rate I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
just ran my hands through it basically I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.360 
just ran my hands through it basically I
didn't<00:03:16.060> run<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.209> brush<00:03:16.450> through<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.780> um<00:03:17.470> I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
probably would not run a brush through

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.890 
probably would not run a brush through
it<00:03:20.500> because<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.730> synthetic<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.690> don't
