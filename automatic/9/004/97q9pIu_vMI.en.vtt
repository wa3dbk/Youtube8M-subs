dry paper bring in that down cleaning my
brush<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.980> between<00:00:41.100> brush<00:00:41.550> strokes

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
brush off in between brush strokes

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.760 
brush off in between brush strokes
adding<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.730> water<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.239> until<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.500> comes

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
adding more water to it until it comes

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
adding more water to it until it comes
down<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> becomes<00:00:47.730> pretty<00:00:48.030> transparent<00:00:48.870> at

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
down and becomes pretty transparent at

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:59.689 
down and becomes pretty transparent at
the<00:00:49.110> bottom<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.980> solve<00:00:56.370> change<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.520> what

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the bottom to solve change and then what

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
the bottom to solve change and then what
I'm<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> flip<00:01:01.890> my

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I'm going to do is I'm going to flip my

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
I'm going to do is I'm going to flip my
paper<00:01:02.730> over<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:04.260> again<00:01:04.470> i'm<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> use

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
paper over and again i'm going to use

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.820 
paper over and again i'm going to use
gravity<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> pull<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.900> down<00:01:07.170> i'll<00:01:07.500> use<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
gravity to pull that down i'll use the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
gravity to pull that down i'll use the
purple<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> first

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
purple we have up here so the first

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.090 
purple we have up here so the first
color<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> pretty<00:01:15.150> intense

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
color is going to be a pretty intense

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.440 
color is going to be a pretty intense
purple<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.860> let<00:01:22.979> gravity<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
purple you can let gravity do it now the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
purple you can let gravity do it now the
other<00:01:24.689> thing<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.110> could<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:25.920> let

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
other thing I could do is I could let

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
other thing I could do is I could let
this<00:01:26.640> totally<00:01:27.240> dry<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this totally dry and then do the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.090 
this totally dry and then do the
gradation<00:01:30.470> after<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> dry<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.740> these

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
gradation after it's dry so all these

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.149 
gradation after it's dry so all these
techniques<00:01:35.640> there's<00:01:35.970> different<00:01:36.360> options

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
techniques there's different options

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.380 
techniques there's different options
that<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.360> but

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that you can have with all of them but

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
that you can have with all of them but
right<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.380> demonstration<00:01:41.390> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
right now for this demonstration it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.440 
right now for this demonstration it's
wet<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.960> wet<00:01:43.640> gradation

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.160 

forth<00:01:54.110> back<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.440> forth<00:01:57.560> remember<00:01:58.560> that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
forth back and forth remember that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
forth back and forth remember that
vacuum<00:02:01.170> cleaner<00:02:01.440> at<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> end<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.570> I've<00:02:06.660> got

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
vacuum cleaner at the end so I've got

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.530 
vacuum cleaner at the end so I've got
this<00:02:06.960> beautiful<00:02:07.200> transition<00:02:07.950> from<00:02:08.399> red<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
this beautiful transition from red to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.820 
this beautiful transition from red to
violet<00:02:09.570> or<00:02:10.200> violet<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:12.060> red<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:13.320> last<00:02:13.560> one

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.330 
create a pattern what's happening to the
edges<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.790> dispersing<00:02:57.360> ooh<00:02:57.780> big<00:02:58.590> word<00:02:58.620> I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340

like<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.790> it's<00:03:00.000> dripping<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.720> spreading

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
like that it's dripping it's spreading

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.610 
like that it's dripping it's spreading
out<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.739> dispersing<00:03:02.190> into<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> space<00:03:03.620> for

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
out it's dispersing into the space for

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.370 
out it's dispersing into the space for
the<00:03:04.709> next<00:03:05.070> demonstration<00:03:05.550> tomorrow<00:03:06.380> I'm
