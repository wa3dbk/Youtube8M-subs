00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 you do not have to be afraid to do that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
 for what we are called 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.039
 to fight against our rival 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.930
 no matter how many times they hit us 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.640
 it does not matter how many times they throw us 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.100
 if it is not we get up to 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.290
 keep fighting 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.750
 and now it's time to recover 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.000
 our identity clean our house 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.330
 Spain cleanse our country does 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.330
 homeland 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 and for six fights I can learn is 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.150
 the boy is full of hate and only goes to 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.480
 bring problems to the centers together to 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.480
 death 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.399
 It is very clear from the distributor if it is going to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.119
 be that you are seeing a salt of the virus and 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.119
 you are hitting something 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.290
 and you're fucking wrong you're a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.290
 shit 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.730
 a new role 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 violence does not go with me 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.939
 really 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 what does it matter to defend that scum 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.890
 you are putting yourself against your 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890
 Julian colleagues 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.690
 to the door and then there's the herd that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690
 do not forget 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.299
 you do not have to be afraid to do that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.960
 for what we are called there is no need 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.960
 be afraid to live
