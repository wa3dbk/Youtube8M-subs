alright I'm just going to do a quick
video<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:03.300> show<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.840> security<00:00:04.560> flaw<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:05.069> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
video to show a security flaw with the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.360 
video to show a security flaw with the
iPhone<00:00:05.609> I've<00:00:06.210> been<00:00:06.509> an<00:00:06.629> iPhone<00:00:07.109> 5<00:00:07.470> I'm<00:00:07.859> sure<00:00:08.130> it

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
iPhone I've been an iPhone 5 I'm sure it

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.810 
iPhone I've been an iPhone 5 I'm sure it
would<00:00:08.460> work<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.760> any<00:00:08.940> iPhone<00:00:09.559> but<00:00:10.559> um<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.550> flaw

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
would work on any iPhone but um the flaw

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.539 
would work on any iPhone but um the flaw
is<00:00:12.679> typically<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.950> plug<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.219> your

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is typically when you plug in your

is typically when you plug in your
iPhone<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:15.480> your<00:00:15.750> computer<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.470> you're

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
iPhone into your computer if you're

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250 
iPhone into your computer if you're
running<00:00:17.190> Windows<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.940> Mac<00:00:18.180> it'll<00:00:18.690> come<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
running Windows or Mac it'll come up and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.189 
running Windows or Mac it'll come up and
on<00:00:19.680> your<00:00:19.859> iPhone<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.430> will<00:00:20.550> ask<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
on your iPhone it will ask you if you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.050 
on your iPhone it will ask you if you
trust<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.650> computer<00:00:22.830> or<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> then<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
trust the computer or not and then you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.269 
trust the computer or not and then you
have<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.539> type<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.990> your<00:00:25.140> security<00:00:25.560> code<00:00:25.890> if

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
have to type in your security code if

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
have to type in your security code if
you<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.320> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
you have one and then you have to go in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.460 
you have one and then you have to go in
and<00:00:28.830> hit<00:00:29.310> yes<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.820> no<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.320> hit

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and hit yes or no and then if you hit

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.580 
and hit yes or no and then if you hit
yes<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.130> mount<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.669> device<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
yes it will mount your device so this is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
yes it will mount your device so this is
just<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.860> security<00:00:35.430> measure<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.910> keep<00:00:36.090> people

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
just a security measure to keep people

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.959 
just a security measure to keep people
from<00:00:36.480> doing<00:00:37.440> basically<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.250> I'm<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
from doing basically what I'm going to

from doing basically what I'm going to
do<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> minute

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
do here in a minute

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
do here in a minute
where<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:40.980> plug<00:00:41.370> into<00:00:41.700> your<00:00:42.000> phone

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
where they can just plug into your phone

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.600 
where they can just plug into your phone
and<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:44.010> files<00:00:44.219> off

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
of it without needing a password or

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
of it without needing a password or
anything<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> screen<00:00:47.640> locked<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
anything with the screen locked on the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.580 
anything with the screen locked on the
phone<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> issue<00:00:50.700> comes<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.719> with

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
phone so the issue comes down to with

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.220 
phone so the issue comes down to with
Linux<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.610> doesn't<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> program<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
Linux it doesn't have this program and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.709 
Linux it doesn't have this program and
you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.039> mount<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.090> phone<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.570> any

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you can just mount up the phone like any

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
you can just mount up the phone like any
other<00:00:57.960> device<00:00:58.379> without<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.980> essentially

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
other device without the essentially

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.680 
other device without the essentially
bypass<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.109> law<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> demonstrate<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
bypass the law so to demonstrate this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.609 
bypass the law so to demonstrate this
I'm<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> plug<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.439> iPhone<00:01:04.979> 5<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.290> see

pictures are right there so anyone can
do<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.970> has<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> Linux<00:01:39.540> distro<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
do this that has a Linux distro and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.420 
do this that has a Linux distro and
Linux<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.040> free<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.729> bun<00:01:42.030> too<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:43.430> so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
Linux is free this is a bun too and so

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.749 
Linux is free this is a bun too and so
it's<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.700> say<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.060> example<00:01:45.560> if<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it's like say for example if this is a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.569 
it's like say for example if this is a
picture<00:01:48.329> or<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.290> your<00:01:49.829> phone<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
picture or this one on your phone but

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370 
picture or this one on your phone but
you<00:01:50.640> didn't<00:01:50.970> want<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> world<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.750> because

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you didn't want the world to see because

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
you didn't want the world to see because
you're<00:01:52.560> making<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:53.180> really<00:01:54.180> bad<00:01:54.420> duck<00:01:54.720> face<00:01:54.960> in

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it or something or worse um this is the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.710 
it or something or worse um this is the
other<00:02:00.450> issue<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.840> wanted<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> bring

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
other issue I wanted to bring

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.320 
other issue I wanted to bring
-<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.560> what<00:02:02.710> there's<00:02:03.550> these<00:02:03.760> apps<00:02:04.030> out<00:02:04.300> there

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
- so what there's these apps out there

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330 
- so what there's these apps out there
where<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.170> can<00:02:05.380> create<00:02:05.620> like<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.890> secret

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
where you can create like a secret

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.940 
where you can create like a secret
hidden<00:02:06.880> folder<00:02:07.480> or<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.950> password-protected

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
hidden folder or a password-protected

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.480 
hidden folder or a password-protected
folder<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.810> basically<00:02:11.380> what<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.100> would<00:02:12.250> do

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
folder so basically what you would do

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.110 
folder so basically what you would do
say<00:02:13.330> like<00:02:13.630> your<00:02:14.170> app<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:15.130> will<00:02:15.310> take<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.790> your

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
say like your app it will take it your

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.720 
say like your app it will take it your
picture<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.200> main<00:02:17.530> photo<00:02:17.890> folder<00:02:18.280> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
picture out of this main photo folder so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.830 
picture out of this main photo folder so
that<00:02:18.760> we<00:02:18.940> want<00:02:19.090> something<00:02:19.270> scrolling<00:02:19.720> through

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
that we want something scrolling through

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.150 
that we want something scrolling through
your<00:02:19.990> phone<00:02:20.230> they<00:02:20.440> won't<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.830> so

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
your phone they won't see it so

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.480 
your phone they won't see it so
essentially<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.240> cut<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.810> out<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:24.280> like

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
essentially if I cut this out just like

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.620 
essentially if I cut this out just like
this<00:02:24.670> I'm<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.000> going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.210> set<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.510> somewhere

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
this I'm just going to set it somewhere

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.150 
this I'm just going to set it somewhere
temporarily<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.630> will<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.560> in

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
temporarily what this will do is in

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.620 
temporarily what this will do is in
effect<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.730> same<00:02:30.940> thing<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.300> one<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.540> those

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
effect the same thing that one of those

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.720 
effect the same thing that one of those
programs<00:02:32.110> will<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.470> assuming<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.580> where<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
programs will do assuming that where I

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.930 
programs will do assuming that where I
put<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.090> was<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> more<00:02:34.840> secure<00:02:35.230> place<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.730> go

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
put it was a more secure place so you go

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.330 
put it was a more secure place so you go
back<00:02:37.180> into<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.050> now<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.709> picture<00:02:39.280> is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
back into here and now that picture is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.100 
back into here and now that picture is
gone<00:02:40.440> kind<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:42.240> they<00:02:43.240> want<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.720> think<00:02:43.959> it's

gone kind of they want you to think it's

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.640 
gone kind of they want you to think it's
gone<00:02:44.380> but<00:02:44.830> what<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> found<00:02:46.120> out<00:02:46.300> today<00:02:46.480> if<00:02:47.380> you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
you deleted it or move it so if I go

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.490 
you deleted it or move it so if I go
into<00:03:17.830> here<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:22.030> will<00:03:22.180> see<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.050> second

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
into here you will see here in a second

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.910 
into here you will see here in a second
once<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.800> loads<00:03:24.120> there's<00:03:25.120> image<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.709> one

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
once it loads there's image to the one

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.580 
once it loads there's image to the one
that<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.130> thought<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.850> move<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.200> basically<00:03:29.470> you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
that I thought and move so basically you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.770 
that I thought and move so basically you
can<00:03:29.709> understand<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.370> if<00:03:31.120> there<00:03:31.450> was<00:03:31.540> some

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
can understand that if there was some

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.000 
can understand that if there was some
confidential<00:03:32.530> stuff<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:32.980> here<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.940> know<00:03:35.010> it's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
confidential stuff on here you know it's

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.590 
confidential stuff on here you know it's
not<00:03:36.160> quite<00:03:36.489> as<00:03:36.640> secure<00:03:37.000> as<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.209> thought<00:03:37.420> it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
not quite as secure as you thought it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.790 
not quite as secure as you thought it
was<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:39.280> yeah<00:03:39.640> be<00:03:40.450> safe<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.519> now<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.580> know
