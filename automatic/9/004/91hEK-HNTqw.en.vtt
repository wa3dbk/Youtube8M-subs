00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi guys, as usual, four 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.130
 tankman and dog 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.550
 I will ask a question then so small 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.699
 An anonymous will do as here is how I live here 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.750
 I mean the question is oil 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.750
 there are three risks 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.279
 you can't see it, but believe the word on 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.240
 their three books are drawn 4 that is 2 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.510
 1 3 for a 41 2 4 risks for a01 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 accordingly, we pour out their three children 20 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 liters and it turns out do not understand how 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 on the top tag and even higher on the act on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 the book that there is written 22 core oil 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.140
 I don't know how much there is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
 what level do i ask who has 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.090
 look or when you notice tired 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.120
 ruler damn the whole first until the end 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 I want to know its length 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 maybe it generally does not have a 41 probe 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 generally hell knows what I would like to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.299
 more precisely this is a question to clarify so further 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.369
 it rains every day 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:21.060
 I'll show you a little niobah. 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 then bought it here is such a pallet 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.049
 laying yes such a trump card 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.820
 compound like puzzles and do well puzzles 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.810
 Puzzle 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.630
 bought repair kit for pump 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 half a pack bought repair kit forget it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.850
 nothing to do and bought conflict frank 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.259
 set of gaskets on the collector here that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.439
 next what's with the collector here 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.479
 happening right here right now flogs all 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.000
 washed off of course yes do not lead to these two 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.520
 cylinder figachit from there exhaust gases 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.390
 I already had time to scare me 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.500
 Piston septum crumbled 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.119
 look at the engine below all the same 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.350
 I realized that there is no partition there 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.429
 scattered everything is normal one stud is not 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 it was generally see 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.680
 and the corrector itself is shifted there relative 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.750
 that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 studs on not included on understand then 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.359

 broke but how can I without this how without 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:28.030

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.069
 Drill or try to buy 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.400
 a set of extractors they never 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.159
 I tried to work, but try how 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.319
 the way the year may have stopped will give you 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.310
 a little bit at least they are all there already 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.129
