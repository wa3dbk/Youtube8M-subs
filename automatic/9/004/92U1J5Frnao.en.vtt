00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:06.229 
hey everybody it's Travis speaking so

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:07.870 
hey everybody it's Travis speaking so
last<00:00:06.439> time<00:00:06.620> we<00:00:06.680> took<00:00:06.950> a<00:00:07.010> look<00:00:07.250> at<00:00:07.460> creating

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
last time we took a look at creating

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.110 
last time we took a look at creating
parts<00:00:08.360> in<00:00:08.599> Autodesk<00:00:09.349> Inventor<00:00:09.639> and<00:00:10.639> what<00:00:10.969> we'd

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
parts in Autodesk Inventor and what we'd

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.299 
parts in Autodesk Inventor and what we'd
like<00:00:11.299> to<00:00:11.360> do<00:00:11.629> today<00:00:11.900> is<00:00:12.080> take<00:00:12.830> a<00:00:12.860> look<00:00:13.129> at

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
like to do today is take a look at

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.879 
like to do today is take a look at
creating<00:00:13.879> a<00:00:14.059> drawing<00:00:14.509> file<00:00:14.870> with<00:00:15.259> those<00:00:15.469> parts

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
creating a drawing file with those parts

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.519 
creating a drawing file with those parts
so<00:00:16.150> one<00:00:17.150> of<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:17.300> nice<00:00:17.450> things<00:00:17.480> about<00:00:17.840> Autodesk

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
so one of the nice things about Autodesk

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.679 
so one of the nice things about Autodesk
Inventor<00:00:18.680> is<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:19.550> once<00:00:19.760> you<00:00:19.910> have<00:00:19.939> a<00:00:20.359> part

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
Inventor is that once you have a part

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.929 
Inventor is that once you have a part
completed<00:00:21.380> you<00:00:21.920> can<00:00:22.099> create<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.580> drawing

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
completed you can create the drawing

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.320 
completed you can create the drawing
from<00:00:23.179> manufacturing<00:00:23.900> very<00:00:24.470> easily<00:00:24.800> and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
from manufacturing very easily and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.669 
from manufacturing very easily and
inventor<00:00:26.330> does<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.509> lot<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.080> work<00:00:27.230> for<00:00:27.560> you

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
inventor does a lot of the work for you

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.429 
inventor does a lot of the work for you
so<00:00:27.890> if<00:00:28.849> we<00:00:28.970> come<00:00:29.179> up<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:29.359> our<00:00:29.630> application<00:00:30.230> menu

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
so if we come up to our application menu

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.470 
so if we come up to our application menu
and<00:00:30.769> we<00:00:31.519> highlight<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.270> new<00:00:33.280> we<00:00:34.280> can<00:00:34.550> go<00:00:35.300> down

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
and we highlight the new we can go down

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.710 
and we highlight the new we can go down
to<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.810> drawing<00:00:36.080> file<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.760> select<00:00:38.210> that<00:00:38.420> and

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
to the drawing file and select that and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.750 
to the drawing file and select that and
notice<00:00:39.170> how<00:00:39.260> it<00:00:39.290> opens<00:00:39.740> up<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.010> nice<00:00:40.160> sheet<00:00:40.460> for

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
notice how it opens up a nice sheet for

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.140 
notice how it opens up a nice sheet for
us<00:00:40.880> already<00:00:41.330> so<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:42.830> start<00:00:43.070> off<00:00:43.250> we<00:00:43.610> come<00:00:44.000> to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
us already so to start off we come to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.080 
us already so to start off we come to
the<00:00:44.270> base<00:00:44.570> tool<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:46.220> will<00:00:46.580> open<00:00:46.760> up<00:00:46.940> a

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
the base tool and this will open up a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.870 
the base tool and this will open up a
dialog<00:00:47.510> box<00:00:47.750> it's<00:00:48.620> already<00:00:48.950> got<00:00:49.100> my<00:00:49.250> carrier

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
dialog box it's already got my carrier

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.020 
dialog box it's already got my carrier
part<00:00:50.300> from<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.720> last<00:00:50.990> video<00:00:51.440> all<00:00:52.010> ready<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.850> go

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
part from the last video all ready to go

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.870 
part from the last video all ready to go
and<00:00:53.600> because<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.650> plane<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:55.130> we<00:00:55.460> started

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
and because of the plane that we started

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.450 
and because of the plane that we started
that<00:00:56.000> part<00:00:56.360> on<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:56.840> want<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.290> go<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.830> choose

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
that part on we want to go and choose

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.290 
that part on we want to go and choose
the<00:00:58.760> left<00:00:59.360> for<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.200> orientation<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.430> we'll

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
the left for the orientation and we'll

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.630 
the left for the orientation and we'll
keep<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.750> visual<00:01:03.290> style<00:01:03.560> as<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.309> for<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
keep the visual style as it is for the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.480 
keep the visual style as it is for the
time<00:01:04.879> being<00:01:05.239> so<00:01:06.020> just<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.979> give<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.189> an<00:01:07.369> idea

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
time being so just to give you an idea

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.569 
time being so just to give you an idea
before<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.119> hit<00:01:08.359> OK<00:01:08.780> you'll<00:01:09.530> already<00:01:10.100> see

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
before you hit OK you'll already see

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.389 
before you hit OK you'll already see
your<00:01:11.060> your<00:01:11.899> base<00:01:12.170> part<00:01:12.500> if<00:01:12.649> I<00:01:12.740> come<00:01:12.979> back<00:01:13.130> in

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
your your base part if I come back in

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.580 
your your base part if I come back in
and<00:01:13.729> click<00:01:13.939> back<00:01:14.240> you'll<00:01:14.869> see<00:01:15.109> what<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.380> base

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
and click back you'll see what the base

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.099 
and click back you'll see what the base
view<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:16.549> I'm<00:01:16.640> gonna<00:01:16.759> go<00:01:16.969> back<00:01:16.999> to<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.840> left

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
view is so I'm gonna go back to the left

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.779 
view is so I'm gonna go back to the left
and<00:01:18.439> I'm<00:01:19.219> just<00:01:19.340> gonna<00:01:19.899> hit<00:01:20.899> OK<00:01:21.490> once<00:01:22.490> I've<00:01:22.609> got

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
and I'm just gonna hit OK once I've got

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.599 
and I'm just gonna hit OK once I've got
that<00:01:22.820> placed<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.659> I'm<00:01:24.439> gonna<00:01:24.590> place<00:01:25.249> a<00:01:25.280> couple

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
that placed and I'm gonna place a couple

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.179 
that placed and I'm gonna place a couple
projected<00:01:26.450> views<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.469> projected<00:01:27.979> views

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
projected views the projected views

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.219 
projected views the projected views
start<00:01:28.549> automatically<00:01:29.359> once<00:01:29.570> you've<00:01:29.810> placed

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
start automatically once you've placed

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.639 
start automatically once you've placed
your<00:01:30.499> your<00:01:31.189> base<00:01:31.640> view<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.409> just

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
your your base view and so you can just

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.050 
your your base view and so you can just
come<00:01:34.100> around<00:01:34.549> on<00:01:35.060> any<00:01:36.049> angle<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.829> it<00:01:37.399> projects

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
come around on any angle and it projects

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.749 
come around on any angle and it projects
that<00:01:38.210> view<00:01:38.479> for<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:40.130> these<00:01:40.399> are<00:01:40.579> all

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
that view for you so these are all

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.090 
that view for you so these are all
pretty<00:01:41.200> straightforward<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:42.799> I'm<00:01:42.859> just<00:01:43.009> gonna

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
pretty straightforward so I'm just gonna

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.849 
pretty straightforward so I'm just gonna
do<00:01:43.340> an<00:01:43.460> isometric<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:45.139> elevation<00:01:45.590> on

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
do an isometric and this elevation on

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.760 
do an isometric and this elevation on
the<00:01:45.979> side<00:01:46.219> and<00:01:46.520> then<00:01:47.179> I'll<00:01:47.329> right-click<00:01:48.200> and

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
the side and then I'll right-click and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.910 
the side and then I'll right-click and
I'll<00:01:49.280> hit<00:01:49.490> create<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:50.469> notice<00:01:51.469> how<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.649> have

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
I'll hit create and notice how I have

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.929 
I'll hit create and notice how I have
these<00:01:52.069> two<00:01:52.399> new<00:01:52.729> views<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:54.649> one<00:01:55.639> of<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.789> great

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
these two new views so one of the great

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.609 
these two new views so one of the great
things<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.689> can<00:01:56.869> do<00:01:56.990> an<00:01:57.109> inventor<00:01:57.499> as

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
things that you can do an inventor as

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.179 
things that you can do an inventor as
well<00:01:57.829> is<00:01:58.359> come<00:01:59.359> into<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> view<00:02:00.319> and<00:02:00.530> highlight

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.809 
over it you see a red dotted line
bordering<00:02:05.389> the<00:02:05.719> part<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.709> you<00:02:06.770> right<00:02:07.609> click

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
bordering the part and you right click

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.010 
bordering the part and you right click
and<00:02:08.119> say<00:02:08.479> retrieve<00:02:09.140> dimensions<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.910> if<00:02:11.900> I

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and say retrieve dimensions so if I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.160 
and say retrieve dimensions so if I
select<00:02:12.290> my<00:02:12.590> view

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
select my view

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.280 
select my view
hit<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.950> select<00:02:15.310> dimensions<00:02:16.020> notice<00:02:17.020> how<00:02:17.140> it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
hit the select dimensions notice how it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.710 
hit the select dimensions notice how it
brings<00:02:17.470> up<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:18.010> number<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.940> dimensions<00:02:19.480> that

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
brings up a number of dimensions that

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.979 
brings up a number of dimensions that
are<00:02:19.870> inherent<00:02:20.530> from<00:02:20.950> my<00:02:21.190> part<00:02:21.459> model<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.690> I'll

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
are inherent from my part model so I'll

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.290 
are inherent from my part model so I'll
just<00:02:23.230> create<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.830> window<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.580> select<00:02:25.060> all<00:02:25.270> of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
just create a window and select all of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.699 
just create a window and select all of
these<00:02:25.569> hit<00:02:26.170> OK

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
these hit OK

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.550 
these hit OK
and<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:28.030> I've<00:02:28.209> got<00:02:28.239> some<00:02:28.599> dimensions<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.349> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and now I've got some dimensions that I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.930 
and now I've got some dimensions that I
can<00:02:29.860> edit<00:02:30.420> afterwards<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.489> grab<00:02:33.730> these

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
can edit afterwards so I can grab these

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.320 
can edit afterwards so I can grab these
grips<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.720> make<00:02:35.709> them<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.000> can<00:02:37.150> see

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
grips and make them so that you can see

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.690 
grips and make them so that you can see
them<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.709> bring<00:02:39.550> them

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
them you can see that you can bring them

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.740 
them you can see that you can bring them
out<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.380> more<00:02:41.380> easily<00:02:41.800> read<00:02:42.569> we'll<00:02:43.569> do

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
out so it's more easily read we'll do

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.320 
out so it's more easily read we'll do
the<00:02:43.840> same<00:02:44.050> thing<00:02:44.230> with<00:02:44.349> these<00:02:44.500> diameter

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the same thing with these diameter

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.720 
the same thing with these diameter
dimensions<00:02:46.330> as<00:02:46.510> well<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.910> go

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
dimensions as well there you go

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.330 
dimensions as well there you go
so<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.060> might<00:02:55.239> want<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> make<00:02:55.600> another<00:02:55.930> view

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
so I might want to make another view

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.150 
so I might want to make another view
maybe<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.489> want<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.970> section<00:02:58.410> what<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> can<00:02:59.709> do<00:02:59.890> is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
maybe I want a section what I can do is

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.930 
maybe I want a section what I can do is
using<00:03:01.030> my<00:03:01.360> my<00:03:02.080> first<00:03:02.470> base<00:03:02.799> view<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.700> click

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
using my my first base view if I click

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.509 
using my my first base view if I click
on<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.239> section<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:05.709> gonna<00:03:05.830> ask<00:03:06.010> me<00:03:06.160> where

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
on this section it's gonna ask me where

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.940 
on this section it's gonna ask me where
I<00:03:06.549> want<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.239> create<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:08.080> section<00:03:08.470> line<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
I want to create my section line so I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.370 
I want to create my section line so I
can<00:03:09.160> do<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> number<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.540> locations<00:03:10.959> but

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
can do that on a number of locations but

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.190 
can do that on a number of locations but
I'm<00:03:11.470> going<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.650> choose<00:03:11.890> my<00:03:12.450> my<00:03:13.450> first<00:03:13.870> base

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
I'm going to choose my my first base

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160 
I'm going to choose my my first base
view<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.549> it's<00:03:15.760> asking<00:03:15.880> me<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.420> create<00:03:17.080> a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
view so it's asking me to create a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.979 
view so it's asking me to create a
section<00:03:17.500> line<00:03:17.830> I'm<00:03:18.010> going<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.220> use<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:19.510> center

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
section line I'm going to use the center

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.229 
section line I'm going to use the center
mark<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.590> arc<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.400> create<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> section

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
mark of that arc to create the section

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.710 
mark of that arc to create the section
line<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:23.170> just<00:03:23.440> draw<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> straight<00:03:23.799> line<00:03:24.160> now<00:03:24.760> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
line and just draw a straight line now I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.080 
line and just draw a straight line now I
define<00:03:25.959> both<00:03:26.410> points<00:03:26.920> all<00:03:27.100> right<00:03:27.130> click<00:03:27.880> and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
define both points all right click and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.509 
define both points all right click and
say<00:03:28.239> continue<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:30.579> projects<00:03:31.239> my<00:03:31.720> new<00:03:31.900> view

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
say continue and it projects my new view

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.780 
say continue and it projects my new view
so<00:03:33.519> if<00:03:33.880> i<00:03:34.060> zoom<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:35.440> I'll<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.280> place<00:03:36.760> that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
so if i zoom in I'll just place that

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.870 
so if i zoom in I'll just place that
above<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.859> you'll<00:03:39.220> notice<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.820> is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
above and you'll notice that this is

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.289 
above and you'll notice that this is
behaving<00:03:40.540> as<00:03:41.070> same<00:03:42.070> view<00:03:42.459> so<00:03:42.790> I'll<00:03:42.910> come<00:03:43.150> in

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
behaving as same view so I'll come in

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.180 
behaving as same view so I'll come in
all<00:03:43.450> three<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.140> dimensions<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.799> this<00:03:44.950> one

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
all three of the dimensions on this one

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.430 
all three of the dimensions on this one
as<00:03:45.370> well<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.640> I'll<00:03:49.239> make<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> crossing<00:03:50.109> window

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
as well and I'll make a crossing window

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.960 
as well and I'll make a crossing window
and<00:03:50.680> select<00:03:50.980> all<00:03:51.160> those<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.859> we<00:03:53.980> can<00:03:54.160> easily

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and select all those and we can easily

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.430 
and select all those and we can easily
drag<00:03:55.540> these<00:03:55.810> dimensions<00:03:56.380> out<00:03:56.950> for<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:58.440> little

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
drag these dimensions out for a little

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.479 
drag these dimensions out for a little
bit<00:03:59.590> easier<00:04:00.010> read<00:04:01.140> maybe<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.260> want<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.620> bring

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
bit easier read maybe I want to bring

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.039 
bit easier read maybe I want to bring
that<00:04:03.640> 0.47<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.900> top<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.609> just<00:04:07.600> pull<00:04:07.870> this

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
that 0.47 to the top and just pull this

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:19.130 
that 0.47 to the top and just pull this
one<00:04:08.290> out<00:04:08.350> inside<00:04:09.010> as<00:04:09.280> well

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.100 

so<00:04:20.140> now<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.320> we've<00:04:20.560> got<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:21.310> section<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.420> some

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
so now that we've got a section and some

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.710 
so now that we've got a section and some
base<00:04:23.380> views<00:04:23.800> maybe<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.970> want<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.270> have<00:04:25.420> this

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
base views maybe you want to have this

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.530 
base views maybe you want to have this
projected<00:04:26.380> view<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:27.070> different<00:04:27.880> shade

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
projected view a different shade

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.750 
projected view a different shade
material<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:29.380> could<00:04:30.480> select<00:04:31.480> your<00:04:31.630> view<00:04:31.900> and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
material you could select your view and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.330 
material you could select your view and
right-click<00:04:33.760> again<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.770> come<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:35.980> edit

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
view button and we'll just hit this

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.290 
view button and we'll just hit this
shaded<00:04:40.360> option<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:42.490> then<00:04:42.610> when<00:04:42.700> we<00:04:42.790> hit<00:04:42.970> OK

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
shaded option and then when we hit OK

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.880 
shaded option and then when we hit OK
you'll<00:04:43.600> see<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:44.080> we've<00:04:44.410> got<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.650> different

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
you'll see that we've got a different

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.810 
you'll see that we've got a different
visual<00:04:45.760> style<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:48.280> there's<00:04:48.460> some<00:04:48.640> other

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
visual style so there's some other

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.570 
visual style so there's some other
things<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.270> can<00:04:49.450> do<00:04:49.690> from<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:51.160> drawing

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
things that you can do from the drawing

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.450 
things that you can do from the drawing
ribbon<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.120> can<00:04:52.240> come<00:04:52.480> to<00:04:52.630> annotate<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.590> you

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
ribbon you can come to annotate and you

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.540 
ribbon you can come to annotate and you
can<00:04:54.640> select<00:04:54.910> specific<00:04:55.920> dimensions<00:04:56.920> from<00:04:57.370> any

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
can select specific dimensions from any

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.220 
can select specific dimensions from any
of<00:04:57.670> these<00:04:57.790> views<00:04:58.150> maybe<00:04:58.570> we<00:04:58.840> want<00:04:59.080> the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
of these views maybe we want the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.740 
of these views maybe we want the
interior<00:04:59.830> diameter<00:05:00.780> plus<00:05:01.780> our<00:05:01.990> Filat<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:04.570> what

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
interior diameter plus our Filat so what

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.430 
interior diameter plus our Filat so what
you<00:05:04.870> do<00:05:05.050> is<00:05:05.260> you<00:05:05.700> select<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:07.810> part<00:05:08.260> of<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
you do is you select that part of the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.340 
you do is you select that part of the
component<00:05:08.920> that<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.280> would<00:05:09.400> like<00:05:10.350> by

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
component that you would like by

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.700 
component that you would like by
highlighting<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.750> simply<00:05:13.750> left-click<00:05:14.260> to

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
highlighting it and simply left-click to

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.340 
highlighting it and simply left-click to
say<00:05:15.040> create<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.510> brings<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:16.960> baseline

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
say create and it brings that baseline

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.630 
say create and it brings that baseline
dimension<00:05:18.010> off<00:05:18.220> of<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.730> part<00:05:18.970> for<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:20.640> you

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
dimension off of the part for you you

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.150 
dimension off of the part for you you
can<00:05:21.760> also<00:05:21.880> do<00:05:22.090> things<00:05:22.390> like<00:05:23.070> change<00:05:24.070> the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
can also do things like change the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.490 
can also do things like change the
dimension<00:05:24.730> style<00:05:24.760> if<00:05:25.419> we<00:05:25.630> wanted<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.110> change

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
dimension style if we wanted to change

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.550 
dimension style if we wanted to change
this<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:27.130> an<00:05:27.310> ANSI<00:05:27.820> we<00:05:28.630> can<00:05:28.810> come<00:05:28.990> here<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.380> the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
this to an ANSI we can come here to the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.580 
this to an ANSI we can come here to the
default<00:05:30.130> millimeter<00:05:30.580> ANSI<00:05:31.180> style<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.320> you'll

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
default millimeter ANSI style and you'll

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.230 
default millimeter ANSI style and you'll
notice<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.010> it<00:05:33.370> aligns<00:05:33.730> it<00:05:34.000> with<00:05:34.120> the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
notice that it aligns it with the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.870 
notice that it aligns it with the
dimension<00:05:34.720> line<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.919> changes<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.460> units

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
dimension line and it changes the units

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.420 
dimension line and it changes the units
so<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:37.870> could<00:05:38.050> select<00:05:38.200> this<00:05:38.500> one<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.130> do<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
so I could select this one and do the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.250 
so I could select this one and do the
same<00:05:39.550> thing<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.510> you'll<00:05:40.690> notice<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.110> it

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
same thing and you'll notice that it

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.310 
same thing and you'll notice that it
turns<00:05:41.500> into<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.740> twelve<00:05:42.070> millimeter<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:44.140> right

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
turns into a twelve millimeter so right

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.150 
turns into a twelve millimeter so right
now<00:05:44.470> these<00:05:44.650> are<00:05:44.710> all<00:05:44.860> in<00:05:45.490> inches<00:05:46.150> we<00:05:46.930> can

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
now these are all in inches we can

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.610 
now these are all in inches we can
change<00:05:48.160> these<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:50.169> maybe<00:05:50.560> we<00:05:50.800> want<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.130> leave

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
change these and maybe we want to leave

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.930 
change these and maybe we want to leave
our<00:05:54.030> degrees<00:05:55.030> here<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:56.169> way<00:05:56.320> they<00:05:56.530> are<00:05:56.940> so

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
our degrees here the way they are so

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.320 
our degrees here the way they are so
we'll<00:05:58.090> leave<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.270> one<00:05:58.510> alone<00:06:00.000> but<00:06:01.000> there<00:06:01.240> you

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
we'll leave that one alone but there you

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.900 
we'll leave that one alone but there you
have<00:06:01.510> it<00:06:01.860> essentially<00:06:02.860> of<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.220> manufacturing

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
have it essentially of a manufacturing

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.760 
have it essentially of a manufacturing
drawing<00:06:04.300> for<00:06:05.080> a<00:06:05.590> carrier<00:06:05.980> apartment<00:06:07.590> now<00:06:08.590> one

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
drawing for a carrier apartment now one

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.470 
drawing for a carrier apartment now one
of<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:08.919> great<00:06:09.160> things<00:06:09.430> about<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:10.150> drawing

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
of the great things about the drawing

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.659 
of the great things about the drawing
files<00:06:10.810> as<00:06:11.260> well<00:06:11.500> is<00:06:11.830> that<00:06:12.100> if<00:06:12.340> you<00:06:12.490> make

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
files as well is that if you make

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.970 
files as well is that if you make
changes<00:06:12.700> after<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:13.750> fact<00:06:15.840> like<00:06:16.840> for<00:06:17.350> instance

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
changes after the fact like for instance

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.490 
changes after the fact like for instance
we<00:06:18.460> could<00:06:18.669> make<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:19.419> change<00:06:19.690> to<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.950> fill<00:06:21.190> it

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
we could make it change to the fill it

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.100 
we could make it change to the fill it
so<00:06:23.500> if<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:23.950> just<00:06:24.820> to<00:06:24.910> show<00:06:25.090> you<00:06:25.150> again<00:06:25.240> if<00:06:26.020> I

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
so if I just to show you again if I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.840 
so if I just to show you again if I
select<00:06:26.620> this<00:06:26.860> fill<00:06:27.220> it<00:06:27.340> feature<00:06:27.550> by

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
select this fill it feature by

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.750 
select this fill it feature by
highlighting<00:06:28.270> it<00:06:28.570> I<00:06:28.780> get<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:29.710> option<00:06:30.130> to<00:06:30.400> edit

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
highlighting it I get the option to edit

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.110 
highlighting it I get the option to edit
it

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.129 
it
click<00:06:32.110> on<00:06:32.290> that<00:06:32.500> and<00:06:32.830> now<00:06:32.919> I<00:06:33.880> can<00:06:34.180> change<00:06:34.540> all

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
click on that and now I can change all

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.850 
click on that and now I can change all
of<00:06:35.199> these<00:06:35.560> by<00:06:35.860> selecting<00:06:36.400> just<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.790> one<00:06:37.060> and

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
of these by selecting just the one and

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.310 
of these by selecting just the one and
change<00:06:38.860> that<00:06:39.040> to<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.250> two<00:06:39.639> millimeter<00:06:40.139> fill<00:06:41.139> it

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
change that to a two millimeter fill it

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.129 
change that to a two millimeter fill it
instead<00:06:41.800> and<00:06:42.389> when<00:06:43.389> I<00:06:43.419> come<00:06:43.690> back<00:06:43.720> to<00:06:43.930> my

instead and when I come back to my

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.770 
instead and when I come back to my
drawing<00:06:44.560> file<00:06:45.030> you'll<00:06:46.030> notice<00:06:46.360> that<00:06:46.570> that

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
drawing file you'll notice that that

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.730 
drawing file you'll notice that that
fill<00:06:47.229> it<00:06:47.410> has<00:06:47.620> updated<00:06:48.250> automatically<00:06:49.740> so

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
fill it has updated automatically so

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.590 
fill it has updated automatically so
that's<00:06:50.860> a<00:06:50.949> brief<00:06:51.250> introduction<00:06:51.760> to<00:06:52.000> creating
