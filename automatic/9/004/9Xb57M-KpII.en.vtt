turn<00:00:40.719> on<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.050> TV<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.930> works<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.590> I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
turn on the TV so that works and I

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.849 
turn on the TV so that works and I
rigged<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.190> so<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.430> can<00:00:48.699> charge<00:00:48.969> it<00:00:49.859> by

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
rigged it so you can charge it by

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.260 
rigged it so you can charge it by
plugging<00:00:51.219> it<00:00:51.489> in<00:00:51.609> right<00:00:51.850> there<00:00:52.090> in<00:00:52.210> that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
plugging it in right there in that

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.900 
plugging it in right there in that
little<00:00:52.390> white<00:00:53.280> from<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.340> base<00:00:54.609> with

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
little white from the base with

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.910 
little white from the base with
this<00:00:55.090> wire<00:00:55.300> right<00:00:55.600> here<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.559> beeps<00:00:59.739> when

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
this wire right here and it beeps when

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.700 
this wire right here and it beeps when
you<00:01:00.039> plug<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.370> in<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:02.199> right<00:01:02.410> now<00:01:02.559> you

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
you plug it in all right now you

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.779 
you plug it in all right now you
probably<00:01:02.829> want<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.309> know<00:01:03.399> if<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.640> actually

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
probably want to know if it actually

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.050 
probably want to know if it actually
works<00:01:05.189> alright<00:01:06.189> so<00:01:06.369> I'll<00:01:06.549> put<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.880> remote

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
works alright so I'll put the remote

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.580 
works alright so I'll put the remote
somewhere<00:01:07.540> i'll<00:01:07.689> hide<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.080> in<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.170> bed<00:01:08.409> or

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
somewhere i'll hide it in the bed or

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.850 
somewhere i'll hide it in the bed or
something<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:13.170> guess<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.320> just<00:01:14.350> turned<00:01:14.680> on

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
something I guess it's just turned on

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.330 
something I guess it's just turned on
but<00:01:15.670> if<00:01:15.850> i<00:01:15.939> press<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.330> button<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.840> base

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
but if i press the button on the base

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
but if i press the button on the base
the<00:01:18.340> phone<00:01:18.549> will<00:01:18.759> start<00:01:18.850> beeping<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.570> just

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
the phone will start beeping and just

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.719 
the phone will start beeping and just
how<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.229> or<00:01:20.650> they<00:01:20.860> are<00:01:20.979> remote<00:01:21.340> will<00:01:21.490> start

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
how you or they are remote will start

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.160 
how you or they are remote will start
beeping<00:01:21.939> and<00:01:22.299> you'll<00:01:22.420> find<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.900> like<00:01:23.049> you

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
beeping and you'll find just like you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.740 
beeping and you'll find just like you
would<00:01:23.259> find<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.619> phone<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.970> has<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.150> pager<00:01:25.509> in

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
would find a phone that has a pager in

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.890 
would find a phone that has a pager in
it<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.400> once<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.000> hear<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.240> noise<00:01:28.540> just<00:01:28.570> get

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
it so once you hear the noise just get

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.850 
it so once you hear the noise just get
close<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.560> can<00:01:29.710> find<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:31.439> mean<00:01:32.439> if<00:01:32.710> I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
close to and you can find it I mean if I

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.710 
close to and you can find it I mean if I
do<00:01:32.920> on<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.520> later<00:01:33.850> version<00:01:34.090> I'd<00:01:34.390> probably<00:01:34.540> try

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
do on a later version I'd probably try

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.030 
do on a later version I'd probably try
to<00:01:34.780> have<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:35.020> button<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.439> here<00:01:35.680> so<00:01:35.829> you<00:01:35.920> could

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
to have a button on here so you could

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.490 
to have a button on here so you could
turn<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.310> off<00:01:36.399> but<00:01:36.700> for<00:01:36.880> now<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.750> come

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
turn it off but for now you have to come

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.020 
turn it off but for now you have to come
up<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.950> base<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.399> press<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.759> button

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
up to the base and press the button

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.480 
up to the base and press the button
again<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.040> mean<00:01:42.189> it's<00:01:42.369> completely

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
again but I mean it's completely

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.389 
again but I mean it's completely
functional<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:43.659> it's<00:01:43.780> just<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.140> idea<00:01:44.399> I've

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
functional and it's just the idea I've

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.520 
functional and it's just the idea I've
been<00:01:45.579> thinking<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:46.060> for<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.329> long<00:01:46.509> time<00:01:46.810> there's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
been thinking of for a long time there's

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.730 
been thinking of for a long time there's
a<00:01:47.619> speaker<00:01:48.189> holes<00:01:48.549> I<00:01:48.729> drilled<00:01:48.759> in<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.619> was

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
a speaker holes I drilled in it it was

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580 
a speaker holes I drilled in it it was
really<00:01:50.979> easy<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.310> do<00:01:51.549> i<00:01:51.579> just<00:01:51.880> had<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.030> gut<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
really easy to do i just had to gut the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.450 
really easy to do i just had to gut the
plastic<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.280> remote<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:56.460> everything

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
plastic of the remote and everything

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.209 
plastic of the remote and everything
works<00:01:57.729> really<00:01:57.909> it's<00:01:58.320> powered<00:01:59.320> on<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.920> remote

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
works really it's powered on the remote

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.550 
works really it's powered on the remote

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and the fun circuit is powered on the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.190 
and the fun circuit is powered on the
battery<00:02:02.860> from<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.250> phone<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:05.020> works

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
battery from the phone it works

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.140 
battery from the phone it works
perfectly<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.960> lot<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.140> soldering<00:02:08.649> and

perfectly just a lot of soldering and

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.760 
perfectly just a lot of soldering and
electrical<00:02:10.150> tape<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.540> guess<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.990> little<00:02:11.530> bit<00:02:11.680> of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
electrical tape I guess a little bit of

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.760 
electrical tape I guess a little bit of
hot<00:02:11.920> glue<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:13.390> yeah<00:02:13.570> here<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.960> is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
hot glue but yeah here it is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.830 
hot glue but yeah here it is
