00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.550
 I was saying I have slept in a 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 Indian reservation that is nothing or nothing more 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.270
 less than a space reserved for 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.040
 live the Indians although they are a bit of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 That's how they are like small countries 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.180
 within the USA with its own laws with 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.309

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.170
 movies and you can confirm with this 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.970
 poster 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 and the Indians are really dedicated to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.670
 sell your culture 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.950
 those are these are the ones that there is very little 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.360
 I work because as you can see there is nothing 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.580
 do here here there are gas stations in a 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.000
 gas station there loss of the hand of 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.830
 there is no God and there is nothing then this 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.399
 people can not work then in almost 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.369
 nothing and they tend to sell 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.140
 Italic crafts is that they do in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.929
 definitively sell your culture but as 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.289
 the culture itself can not be sold 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.650
 they sell the good crafts they made me a 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.560
 Indian friend 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.510
 and the man uncle taught me some 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.900
 italy beads that made silver me 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.400
 I bought an Indian cross from the Indians to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.540
 coma 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.120
 that gave me an authentic Indian to eat 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.599
 He also gave it to me when he was at home or 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.480
 beat invited me to his house and now I'm 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.150
 has finished filling up with new gas 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.680
 for monument valley and stay fire 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.939
 sleep in the bed as god sends more 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.939
 money is bullshit 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.160
 no no no no no 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.540
 well I'm in the place dreamed that is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.930
 monument valley monument valley is this 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.930
 And it is 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.170
 this is official Navajo Indian land 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.849
 and the funny thing is just when it starts 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.980
 monument valley is where it ends 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.860
 arizona and it starts to help it seems like 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.400
 if someone had painted the rocks 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.970
 when actually look there's there there 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.970
 wild horses 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.830
 i 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 do not 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.720
 leaving the land 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.689
 down 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.789
 I'm going to the Grand Canyon of Colorado 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.959
 which is where I'm going to spend the next 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:09.659
 day after having lived this 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:11.069
 adventure in monument valley that was one 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.129
 of the places you've always wanted 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.529
 go and this is the place that I always 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.009
 you have the image 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:23.269
 and the mental when you speak of the west is 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.649
 something like that when people and refers to 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:27.059
 American west really the image that 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:28.380
 it comes to your head is something like 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:33.300
 that 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:37.530
 the receivers the cowboys as I go this 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.460
 it really is well inhabited by 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.360
 Indians 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.360
 down 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.909
 I want 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.690
 today I wanted to make a pretty reflection 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.070
 important because I was really 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.960
 realizing that while I was 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.750
 climbing this hill was looking all 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.100
 this landscape by the car window 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.410
 and there was a time I've stopped 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.230
 pay attention to what was behind and 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.290
 I thought you really need to live 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.000
 to the maximum everything that surrounds you always 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.409
 because you do not know I do not know if I'm going back 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.860
 here in my life is an incredible site 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:28.559
 and full of history it's amazing to be 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.289
 here and the feeling you have is the 

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:33.809
 to be on another planet is very 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.629
 important to always live what what 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.709
 It surrounds you and be where you are because 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.929
 Sometimes you are in a place but 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:41.789
 mentally you are not there or you are not 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:45.509
 enjoying what surrounds you and is a 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.369
 mistake because I maybe I do not know god 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.379
 I do not want to, but maybe I'm not here 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:51.239
 come back never ever in my life in my 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.939
 existence nor on planet earth 

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:57.779
 maybe never come to another site like 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:07:00.610
 this never ever that's why I want 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.889
 enjoy the time that is where I am 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.270
 so I think it 's a good time to 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.949
 start thinking this way and 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.900
 start to really enjoy what you 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.400
 always surrounds now that I'm here 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.729
 I realize that 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.600
 this you must enjoy it is mandatory 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:19.290
 enjoy 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.240
 and little else I'm going to follow my route 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.310
 towards cheating the colorado and then 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.360
 towards las vegas' a greeting to all and 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.360
 thanks for following me
