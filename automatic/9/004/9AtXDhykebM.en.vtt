00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.289
 dear gardeners today we want 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.760
 talk about grasshoppers many takes 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.860
 of these 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.810
 large grasshoppers take him so now 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.170
 there sits at the locust 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.320
 in fact it is not the locust it is green 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.470
 grasshoppers are just such their 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.810
 the large size attracts attention and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.279
 because of this large size everyone thinks 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.800
 what is it voracious locust 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.350
 but we consulted with us in our 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.320
 Nizhny Novgorod Botanical Garden us 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.680
 said it was completely harmless 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.230
 creatures harm our plant they 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.620
 no cause but if bite off 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.040
 there is literally there a bit of weed from 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.339
 which is okay and they eat 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.830
 mostly even insects and small 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.290
 I once had the good fortune to see how 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.049
 Here is a grasshopper attacked by a big noise 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.150
 ear I have pictures where it is firmly 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.400
 sits and aims for the next one 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.100
 moment he produced so fast that i 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.650
 of course, and did not have time to shoot but the difference is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.440
 this grasshopper from the locust look at 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.990
 he has a very long mustache in locust 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.440
 antennae are short and here you can even 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.660
 look at this poor man 11 luman he 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.000
 short and the other long 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.910
 so here they are before us almost what 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 than this one broken off 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.840
 short mustache is the second time our 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 The grasshopper is much longer than the legs 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.580
 locust 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.550
 and here on these legs if you look closely 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.000
 he has such indent there and they are still 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.010
 almost the entire length of the leg 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.230
 here are locusts 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.840
 these nags are located only on 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.820
 lower limb and there in general 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.150
 must nicks from the power of the spines 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.790
 a big shield such a bite before much 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.190
 more eyes and more head 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.119
 that is, it's our grasshoppers 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 completely harmless creatures can 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.370
 say next our friends because 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.970
 they and small insects eat among them 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.010
 comes across a lot of garden pests so 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.560
 don't kill them please don't be afraid 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.090
 but they shouldn't be taken in hand either 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.970
 what if 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.670
 you see him strongly now he is trying 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.340
 take a sunbath in the morning and not 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.200
 basking in here like this 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.810
 disturb he can bite 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.230
 there is no burning sensation 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.269
 press a little finger but nothing 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.480
 there is nothing pleasant about it 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:51.260
 look recognize grasshopper over long 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.260
