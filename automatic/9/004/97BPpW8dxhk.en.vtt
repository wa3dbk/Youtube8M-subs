attitude of a regular normal time to
evaluate<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.940> very<00:01:24.299> very

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890

distinguished way to give us some
feedback

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.710 

we<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.960> simulated<00:01:34.830> various<00:01:35.720> accident

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
we have simulated various accident

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
we have simulated various accident
procedures<00:01:37.260> that<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.590> could<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
procedures that you could have it is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
procedures that you could have it is
pretty<00:01:38.910> fascinating<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.320> how

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
pretty fascinating to see how

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.320 
pretty fascinating to see how
intelligent<00:01:41.570> those<00:01:42.570> systems<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:45.090> had<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
intelligent those systems are we had the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.900 
intelligent those systems are we had the
discussion<00:01:45.530> that's<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.650> warning<00:01:46.890> come<00:01:47.220> down

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
discussion that's the warning come down

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.850 
discussion that's the warning come down
appropriate<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.840> or<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> too<00:01:49.410> late<00:01:49.620> or

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
appropriate time or is it too late or

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
appropriate time or is it too late or
too<00:01:49.890> early<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> told<00:01:51.360> him<00:01:51.540> okay<00:01:51.869> try<00:01:52.260> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
too early so I told him okay try to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
too early so I told him okay try to
avoid<00:01:52.710> after<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> hear<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.090> warning<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.720> he

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
avoid after you hear that warning and he

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
avoid after you hear that warning and he
did<00:01:55.140> excellent<00:01:55.619> steering<00:01:56.250> maneuver<00:01:56.340> very

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
did excellent steering maneuver very

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.870 
did excellent steering maneuver very
precise<00:01:57.330> but<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.470> end<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:59.100> said<00:01:59.490> okay<00:01:59.760> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
precise but at the end we said okay the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
precise but at the end we said okay the
way<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.150> did<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> new<00:02:01.080> c-class<00:02:01.440> if

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
way we did it for the new c-class if

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.280 
way we did it for the new c-class if
it's<00:02:01.950> exactly<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:04.880> first<00:02:05.880> safety<00:02:06.570> safety
