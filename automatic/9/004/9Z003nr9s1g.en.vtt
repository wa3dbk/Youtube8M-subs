fish was and they were humongous after

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.270 
fish was and they were humongous after
that<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.550> was<00:01:58.760> nice<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.300> rinse<00:01:59.570> sleep<00:02:00.280> right

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
that it was nice to rinse sleep right

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.930 
that it was nice to rinse sleep right
here<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:03.280> what<00:02:04.280> I'm<00:02:04.310> going<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.550> do<00:02:04.640> here<00:02:04.910> is

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
here and what I'm going to do here is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.120 
here and what I'm going to do here is
cut<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.450> into<00:02:05.630> about<00:02:06.260> four<00:02:07.660> four<00:02:08.660> pieces<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:09.500> it

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
cut it into about four four pieces so it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.570 
cut it into about four four pieces so it
will<00:02:10.670> be<00:02:10.700> easier<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.240> brine<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.960> I'm<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.580> when

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
will be easier to brine and I'm and when

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.950 
will be easier to brine and I'm and when
you<00:02:13.730> eat<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.330> smaller<00:02:15.760> certainly<00:02:16.960> I'd

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
you eat it it's smaller certainly I'd

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.530 
you eat it it's smaller certainly I'd
rather<00:02:18.230> put<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.280> pieces<00:02:19.580> rather<00:02:20.300> than

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
rather put it in pieces rather than

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.680 
rather put it in pieces rather than
putting<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.080> whole<00:02:21.560> fish<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.940> think<00:02:23.600> it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
putting the whole fish in I think it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.010 
putting the whole fish in I think it
takes<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:24.400> lot<00:02:25.400> longer<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.810> whole

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
takes a lot longer we have this whole

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.100 
takes a lot longer we have this whole
fish<00:02:27.350> put<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.739> when<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.340> smoke<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:29.110> ivy

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
fish put in when you smoke it with ivy

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.800 
fish put in when you smoke it with ivy
for<00:02:30.290> having<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.800> sliced<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:32.420> little<00:02:32.870> portions

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
for having it sliced in little portions

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.060 
for having it sliced in little portions
and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:35.959> here<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.850> about<00:02:37.850> four<00:02:38.630> or<00:02:38.660> five

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
and then here is a about four or five

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.920 
and then here is a about four or five
salmon<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.310> just<00:02:40.550> pushed<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.390> portioned
