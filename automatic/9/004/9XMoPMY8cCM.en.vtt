you<00:03:00.120> need<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.540> well<00:03:00.990> mine<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.040> craft

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
you need to well mine and craft

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.460 
you need to well mine and craft
everything<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.300> progress<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.960> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
everything to progress and that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.070 
everything to progress and that
progression<00:03:04.860> can<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.310> slow<00:03:05.550> going<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> the

progression can be slow going so the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.900

there<00:03:13.350> are<00:03:13.470> faster<00:03:13.890> means<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.280> getting<00:03:14.370> around

there are faster means of getting around

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.060 
there are faster means of getting around
yeah<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:15.540> only<00:03:15.900> really<00:03:16.470> useful<00:03:16.890> for

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
yeah but only really useful for

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.190 
yeah but only really useful for
travelling<00:03:17.550> downwards<00:03:18.090> quickly<00:03:18.600> going

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200

travelling downwards quickly going
across<00:03:19.590> larger<00:03:20.070> distances<00:03:20.700> would<00:03:20.850> use<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.210> a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
across larger distances would use up a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.600 
across larger distances would use up a

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.760 
ton of resources which isn't really
something<00:03:23.880> deliberately<00:03:24.480> earned<00:03:24.810> more<00:03:25.230> just

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
something deliberately earned more just

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.470 
something deliberately earned more just
the<00:03:25.920> side-effect<00:03:26.520> of<00:03:26.670> digging<00:03:27.030> deeper<00:03:27.420> and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
the side-effect of digging deeper and

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.890 
the side-effect of digging deeper and
deeper<00:03:27.959> boats<00:03:28.970> these<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.180> great<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:30.390> early

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
deeper boats these are great for early

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
game travel across water but are really

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.390 
game travel across water but are really
situational<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.770> respect

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
situational in that respect

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.580 
situational in that respect
besides<00:03:36.120> chopping<00:03:36.690> down<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.840> tree<00:03:36.959> isn't

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
besides chopping down a tree isn't

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.910 
besides chopping down a tree isn't
exactly<00:03:37.980> earning<00:03:38.760> your<00:03:38.910> travel<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.320> what's

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
exactly earning your travel so what's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.420 
exactly earning your travel so what's
left

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
