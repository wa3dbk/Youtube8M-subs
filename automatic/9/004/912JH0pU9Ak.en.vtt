00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
okay I'm now going to talk about what

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.140 
okay I'm now going to talk about what
Peter<00:00:12.320> Green<00:00:12.620> plays<00:00:13.070> in<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:13.430> backing<00:00:13.850> he'd<00:00:14.030> be

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
Peter Green plays in the backing he'd be

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:25.610 
Peter Green plays in the backing he'd be
playing<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.540> sort<00:00:14.719> of<00:00:14.809> saxophone<00:00:15.440> riff

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.590 

so<00:00:26.280> I<00:00:26.970> hope<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.870> see<00:00:28.020> that<00:00:28.200> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
so I hope you can see that this is the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.990 
so I hope you can see that this is the
12th<00:00:30.600> fret<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> he's<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.550> playing<00:00:33.290> the

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
12th fret so he's just playing the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.860 
12th fret so he's just playing the
essential<00:00:36.000> three<00:00:36.239> notes<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.750> E<00:00:36.840> chord

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
essential three notes of an E chord

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.420 
essential three notes of an E chord
remember<00:00:37.560> we're<00:00:37.710> playing<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
remember we're playing this in the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.210 
remember we're playing this in the
Jeremy's<00:00:39.120> guitars<00:00:39.540> tuned<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.290> an<00:00:40.410> open<00:00:40.770> tuning

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
Jeremy's guitars tuned to an open tuning

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.280 
Jeremy's guitars tuned to an open tuning
but<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> conventional<00:00:43.140> guitar

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
but this this is a conventional guitar

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.360 
but this this is a conventional guitar
now<00:00:43.739> back<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.520> normal<00:00:44.910> cheering<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> we're

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now back to a normal cheering so we're

00:00:47.370 --> 00:01:00.020 
now back to a normal cheering so we're
playing<00:00:49.790> B<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:57.680> flat<00:00:58.680> which<00:00:59.310> is<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> third<00:00:59.910> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
playing B a a flat which is the third of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.999 
playing B a a flat which is the third of
the<00:01:00.090> chord<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.510> E<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> E<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:03.020> that's<00:01:04.020> your<00:01:04.259> rib

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.710 

then

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
then

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
then
so<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.410> pattern<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.920> moves<00:01:14.160> five

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so the the pattern in moves five

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050 
so the the pattern in moves five
semitones<00:01:15.660> higher<00:01:15.920> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.160> like<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.729> that's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
semitones higher if you like but that's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.900 
semitones higher if you like but that's
the<00:01:18.479> equivalent<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.050> moving<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.670> here

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
the equivalent of moving down to here

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.910 
the equivalent of moving down to here
against<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.930> chord<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> chord<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
against the a chord when the a chord is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.710 
against the a chord when the a chord is
playing<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.399> it's<00:01:23.550> exactly<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.450> same<00:01:24.600> pattern

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.680 

and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.450> down

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
and then back to the and then just down

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.560 
and then back to the and then just down
one<00:01:36.990> string<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> against<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> vehicle

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
one string to do it against the vehicle

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.810 
one string to do it against the vehicle
and<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.869> two<00:01:43.110> frets<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.860> chord<00:01:44.750> back

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.580 

now<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:51.030> don't<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> song<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.259> if

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
now they don't do it in this song but if

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
now they don't do it in this song but if
you<00:01:52.829> were<00:01:52.950> doing<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.369> arrangement<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you were doing an arrangement of this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.510 
you were doing an arrangement of this
you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.720> take<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.110> riff<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.369> goes

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you can take that riff and when it goes

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
you can take that riff and when it goes
up<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> instead<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> moving<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> whole

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
up to the a instead of moving the whole

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.200 
up to the a instead of moving the whole
pattern<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.960> fit<00:02:04.170> against<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.280> ends

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
pattern to fit against the a so it ends

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.300 
pattern to fit against the a so it ends
in<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.720> force<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
in and they know you can force the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
in and they know you can force the
original<00:02:11.819> pound<00:02:12.150> thing<00:02:12.599> by<00:02:13.290> doing<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:17.330> by

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
original pound thing by doing this by

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.690 
original pound thing by doing this by
not<00:02:19.290> playing<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.799> flat<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.549> a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
not playing the a flat because the a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.150 
not playing the a flat because the a
flat<00:02:21.030> would<00:02:21.810> certainly<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.500> fit<00:02:22.799> against<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
flat would certainly not fit against the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.039 
flat would certainly not fit against the
a<00:02:23.220> chord<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:23.640> by<00:02:23.819> playing<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> G<00:02:24.450> which<00:02:24.780> makes

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
a chord but by playing the G which makes

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.699 
a chord but by playing the G which makes
a<00:02:25.670> seventh<00:02:26.670> against<00:02:27.030> their<00:02:27.180> chord<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> you've

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
a seventh against their chord so you've

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.630 
a seventh against their chord so you've
got<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> thirteenth<00:02:29.489> note<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:31.380> your<00:02:31.640> original

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
got the thirteenth note in your original

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.030 
got the thirteenth note in your original
riff<00:02:33.090> against<00:02:33.569> Daddy<00:02:33.780> chord<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:36.680> know<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.739> guys

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
riff against Daddy chord I know you guys

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.910 
riff against Daddy chord I know you guys
tune<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.340> chord<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:39.260> G<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.440> make<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.709> seventh<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
tune a chord a G to make the seventh and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.100 
tune a chord a G to make the seventh and
an<00:02:44.130> e<00:02:44.280> which<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.910> 5th<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:47.120> chord<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.360> against

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
an e which is the 5th a chord so against

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.410 
an e which is the 5th a chord so against
the<00:02:49.260> even<00:02:49.620> though<00:02:52.609> when<00:02:53.609> it<00:02:53.700> changes<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.269> their

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the even though when it changes to their

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.660 
the even though when it changes to their
a<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:59.030> back<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> E<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:02.130> then<00:03:02.340> force

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
a you go back to the E and then force

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.960 
a you go back to the E and then force
this<00:03:04.160> against<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.370> B<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.890> will<00:03:08.160> all<00:03:08.310> work<00:03:08.340> so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
this against the B it will all work so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.020 
this against the B it will all work so
there<00:03:09.420> are<00:03:09.540> two<00:03:09.920> variations<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.519> can<00:03:11.640> do

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
there are two variations that you can do

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.280 
there are two variations that you can do
there<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:14.220> fact<00:03:14.820> if<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.540> person<00:03:16.140> was

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
there and in fact if one person was

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.599 
there and in fact if one person was
playing<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:19.040> moving<00:03:20.040> down<00:03:20.190> but

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
playing this and then moving down but

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.000 
playing this and then moving down but
the<00:03:20.700> other<00:03:20.819> was<00:03:21.060> doing<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:25.470> almost<00:03:25.769> have

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the other was doing this you almost have

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.920 
the other was doing this you almost have

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
a sort of big band arrangement of the

a sort of big band arrangement of the
way<00:03:28.049> those<00:03:28.260> two<00:03:29.269> versions<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:30.450> against<00:03:30.870> each

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
way those two versions go against each

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.809 
way those two versions go against each
other<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.650> might<00:03:31.829> be<00:03:31.950> quite<00:03:32.160> interesting<00:03:32.700> for

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
other it might be quite interesting for

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.710 
other it might be quite interesting for
someone<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.269> do<00:03:34.609> some<00:03:35.609> work<00:03:35.790> v<00:03:36.000> would<00:03:36.269> just<00:03:36.569> be

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
someone to do some work v would just be

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.240 
someone to do some work v would just be
doing<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.230> basic<00:03:39.440> blues<00:03:40.440> thing<00:03:40.829> again<00:03:41.340> using

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
doing a basic blues thing again using

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.140 
doing a basic blues thing again using
essentially<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.930> three

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
essentially the the three

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.360 
essentially the the three
notes<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.530> chord<00:03:49.799> that's<00:03:50.010> playing<00:03:50.189> at<00:03:50.340> a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
notes of the chord that's playing at a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.940 
notes of the chord that's playing at a
time<00:03:50.939> so<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.120> got<00:03:51.329> e<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:53.060> flat<00:03:54.060> we<00:03:54.739> with<00:03:55.739> maybe

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
time so you got e a flat we with maybe

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:05.569 
time so you got e a flat we with maybe
the<00:03:56.599> six<00:03:59.269> D<00:04:00.269> flat<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.840> going<00:04:04.310> maybe<00:04:05.310> even

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
the six D flat is it going maybe even

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:24.900 
the six D flat is it going maybe even
the<00:04:05.670> octave

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.960 

sort<00:04:25.910> by<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.120> appalling<00:04:26.480> speakers<00:04:27.200> out<00:04:27.970> and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
sort by the appalling speakers out and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.270 
sort by the appalling speakers out and
also<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.420> don't<00:04:30.020> think<00:04:30.200> these<00:04:30.320> guitars<00:04:31.040> are<00:04:31.190> in

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
also I don't think these guitars are in

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.770 
also I don't think these guitars are in
tune<00:04:31.520> with<00:04:31.730> each<00:04:31.790> other<00:04:32.120> but<00:04:32.420> I<00:04:32.450> was<00:04:32.750> just

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
tune with each other but I was just

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.060 
tune with each other but I was just
trying<00:04:33.140> to<00:04:33.320> get<00:04:33.440> across<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:34.060> principle
