the one channel so that you cannot like
a<00:00:51.570> switch<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.199> could<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:53.010> four<00:00:53.280> things

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a switch you could have four things

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
a switch you could have four things
running<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:53.850> once<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.690> here's<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> thing

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
running at once but here's the thing

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
running at once but here's the thing
this<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.149> built-in<00:00:59.030> USB<00:01:00.030> and

actually networking to other Allen &amp;
Heath<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.710> digital

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
Heath here as well this is a digital

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
Heath here as well this is a digital
mixer<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> built-in<00:01:06.090> sound<00:01:06.570> card<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.409> what

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
mixer with a built-in sound card so what

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.750 
mixer with a built-in sound card so what
does<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> mean<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> means

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
does that mean for you well it means

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
does that mean for you well it means
that<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.119> well<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.659> line<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.439> phono<00:01:10.890> input

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that as well as a line and phono input

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
that as well as a line and phono input
to<00:01:11.460> both<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> these<00:01:11.850> channels<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> USB

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
to both of these channels you have a USB

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.399 
to both of these channels you have a USB
input

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
input

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
input
you<00:01:14.070> might<00:01:14.280> notice<00:01:14.490> there's<00:01:14.790> no<00:01:14.909> switch<00:01:15.210> or

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you might notice there's no switch or

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
you might notice there's no switch or
anything<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> USB

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
anything for that that's because the USB

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
anything for that that's because the USB
input<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.670> comes<00:01:18.000> through<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.630> really

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
input just comes through so really

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
input just comes through so really
effectively<00:01:19.799> you've<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.430> three<00:01:20.790> things

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
effectively you've got three things

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.130 
effectively you've got three things
coming<00:01:21.420> through<00:01:21.630> each<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> these<00:01:21.900> channels

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
coming through each of these channels

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.200 
coming through each of these channels
should<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.580> effectively

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
should you want that this is effectively

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990 
should you want that this is effectively
three<00:01:24.900> plus<00:01:25.229> three<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.400> pseudo<00:01:26.729> six

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
three plus three or kind of pseudo six

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
three plus three or kind of pseudo six
channel<00:01:27.330> mixer<00:01:27.689> plus<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> nine<00:01:28.350> channel

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
channel mixer plus the nine channel

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
channel mixer plus the nine channel
so<00:01:29.460> you've<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:29.939> inputs<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> DJ

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
so you've got two inputs from the DJ

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
so you've got two inputs from the DJ
software<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.860> mentioned<00:01:32.280> two

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
software and as I just mentioned two

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.630 
software and as I just mentioned two
lines<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> two<00:01:33.299> phono<00:01:33.570> inputs<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.530> also<00:01:34.799> feeds

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
lines and two phono inputs it also feeds

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
lines and two phono inputs it also feeds
back<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.540> DJ<00:01:36.930> software<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> if

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
back into your DJ software so that if

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
back into your DJ software so that if
you<00:01:37.950> set<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> set<00:01:39.600> your

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you set it up right or you set your

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.929 
you set it up right or you set your
laptop<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.500> run<00:01:40.710> concurrently<00:01:41.430> something

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
laptop up to run concurrently something

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
laptop up to run concurrently something
