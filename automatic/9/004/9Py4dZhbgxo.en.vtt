00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
songs before I think somebody played

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.180 
songs before I think somebody played
ghost<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:43.140> else<00:00:43.230> linked<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> me<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> just

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
ghost or else linked it to me and I just

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.979 
ghost or else linked it to me and I just
kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.610> casually<00:00:45.120> listened<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
kind of casually listened to it and I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
kind of casually listened to it and I
think<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> track<00:00:46.770> new<00:00:46.980> Americana<00:00:47.520> was

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
think that the track new Americana was

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
think that the track new Americana was
on<00:00:47.969> an<00:00:48.120> alternative<00:00:48.719> station<00:00:49.170> somewhere<00:00:49.770> at

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
on an alternative station somewhere at

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
on an alternative station somewhere at
some<00:00:50.100> point<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.820> remember<00:00:51.149> hearing<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
some point I think I remember hearing it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
some point I think I remember hearing it
but<00:00:51.989> nothing<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.590> stuck<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.070> me<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
but nothing really stuck with me and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
but nothing really stuck with me and
made<00:00:53.760> me<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> check<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> her

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
made me want to check out more of her

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
made me want to check out more of her
material<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.190> listening<00:00:56.940> through<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
material and now listening through this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
material and now listening through this
debut<00:00:57.690> album<00:00:58.079> Badlands<00:00:58.800> I've<00:00:59.010> realized<00:00:59.640> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
actually have some kind of major

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually have some kind of major
problems<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.250> artist<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.120> nothing

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
problems with this artist it's nothing

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
problems with this artist it's nothing
to<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.809> how<00:01:04.140> she<00:01:04.199> presents<00:01:04.559> herself<00:01:04.920> or

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to do with how she presents herself or

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
to do with how she presents herself or
the<00:01:05.369> actual<00:01:05.700> talent<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.270> she<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:06.659> have

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the actual talent that she does have

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
the actual talent that she does have
because<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> deny<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
because I'm not going to deny that it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
because I'm not going to deny that it's
just<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> fact<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.360> she<00:01:09.570> slips<00:01:09.990> through<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
just the fact that she slips through the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750 
just the fact that she slips through the
cracks<00:01:10.380> whenever<00:01:11.070> compared<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> her

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
cracks whenever compared to her

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.399 
cracks whenever compared to her
contemporaries<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:13.020> you're<00:01:13.229> probably

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
contemporaries now you're probably

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
contemporaries now you're probably
wondering<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:14.159> why<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.610> comparing<00:01:15.060> her

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
wondering well why are you comparing her

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
wondering well why are you comparing her
to<00:01:15.330> somebody<00:01:15.810> else<00:01:16.049> she<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.380> someone<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to somebody else she is someone in and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
to somebody else she is someone in and
of<00:01:17.130> herself<00:01:17.310> well<00:01:17.939> yes<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> problem<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
of herself well yes but the problem is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.740 
of herself well yes but the problem is
whenever<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.979> listen<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> her<00:01:20.640> music<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> hear

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
whenever I listen to her music I hear

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
whenever I listen to her music I hear
somebody<00:01:22.200> else<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.040> best<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
somebody else I think the best way to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
somebody else I think the best way to
describe<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.630> me<00:01:24.659> personally<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
describe it really for me personally is

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
describe it really for me personally is
probably<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.009> cross<00:01:26.490> between<00:01:26.759> Ren<00:01:27.270> Weaver<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
probably a cross between Ren Weaver and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
probably a cross between Ren Weaver and
Avril<00:01:28.380> Lavigne<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.579> we've

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
Avril Lavigne and then here we are we've

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
Avril Lavigne and then here we are we've
got<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.659> many<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> reasons<00:01:31.740> why<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
got how see many of the reasons why this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
got how see many of the reasons why this
album<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.640> fails<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> launch<00:01:33.450> live<00:01:33.780> within

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
album really fails to launch live within

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
album really fails to launch live within
the<00:01:34.200> lack<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.439> ingenuity<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the lack of ingenuity or to put it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
the lack of ingenuity or to put it
simply<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> sounds<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.320> stuff<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.799> I've

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
simply it sounds like stuff that I've

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
simply it sounds like stuff that I've
heard<00:01:38.130> before<00:01:38.310> from<00:01:38.820> other<00:01:39.000> artists<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
heard before from other artists the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
heard before from other artists the
comparisons<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.680> distinct<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.340> tracks

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
comparisons are so distinct on tracks

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
comparisons are so distinct on tracks
like<00:01:41.909> hurricane<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.750> hold<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:43.110> down<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
like hurricane and hold me down but I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.710 
like hurricane and hold me down but I
almost<00:01:43.829> find<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.909> distracting

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
almost find it to be a bit distracting

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240 
almost find it to be a bit distracting
whenever<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.409> trying<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> listen<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
whenever I'm really trying to listen and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.069 
whenever I'm really trying to listen and
hone<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> these<00:01:48.360> songs<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
hone in on some of these songs and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.380 
hone in on some of these songs and
unfortunately<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
unfortunately it's not just these two it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.840 
unfortunately it's not just these two it
really<00:01:51.630> pops<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.409> good<00:01:52.890> chunk<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
really pops up on a good chunk of this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
really pops up on a good chunk of this
record<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.590> these

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
record and I think that some of these

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
record and I think that some of these
songs<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.100> charming<00:01:56.460> enough<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.450> really

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
songs are charming enough but it really

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.539 
songs are charming enough but it really
is<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:57.930> far<00:01:58.409> from<00:01:58.680> having<00:01:59.009> me<00:01:59.130> under<00:01:59.399> its

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
is just far from having me under its

00:01:59.549 --> 00:01:59.959 
is just far from having me under its
spell

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
spell

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.030 
spell
if<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.630> struggle<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> find<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.350> true<00:02:01.530> identity

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
if the struggle to find a true identity

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
if the struggle to find a true identity
wasn't<00:02:02.250> enough<00:02:02.670> I'm<00:02:02.909> finding<00:02:03.450> myself

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
wasn't enough I'm finding myself

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600 
wasn't enough I'm finding myself
completely<00:02:04.229> disinterested<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
completely disinterested with the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.969 
completely disinterested with the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
majority of what she has to say now it's

not that all of them are throwaway

whenever<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.310> was<00:03:00.459> listening<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.970> Hal<00:03:01.090> C<00:03:01.359> in

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
whenever I was listening to Hal C in

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.210 
whenever I was listening to Hal C in
fact<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.170> ball<00:03:02.379> really<00:03:02.650> started<00:03:03.099> getting

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
fact the ball really started getting

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.339 
fact the ball really started getting
rolling<00:03:03.639> at<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.090> point<00:03:04.359> I<00:03:04.540> mean<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.989> streak

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
rolling at this point I mean this streak

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.110 
rolling at this point I mean this streak
continues<00:03:05.889> through<00:03:06.159> this<00:03:06.340> song<00:03:06.609> all<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.030> way

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
continues through this song all the way

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.789 
continues through this song all the way
towards<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.510> end<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> record<00:03:08.109> getting

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
towards the end of the record getting

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.559 
towards the end of the record getting
back<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.129> Holiday<00:03:09.519> though<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.879> really<00:03:10.180> like<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
back to Holiday though I really like the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.809 
back to Holiday though I really like the
airy<00:03:10.750> synthesizers<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.980> snarky<00:03:12.400> vocals

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
airy synthesizers and the snarky vocals

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.580 
airy synthesizers and the snarky vocals
but<00:03:12.970> bleed<00:03:13.209> their<00:03:13.359> way<00:03:13.480> into<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.200> even

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
but bleed their way into this one even

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.500 
but bleed their way into this one even
though<00:03:14.709> there's<00:03:14.950> nothing<00:03:15.310> too<00:03:15.609> crazy<00:03:15.879> going

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
though there's nothing too crazy going

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.000 
though there's nothing too crazy going
on<00:03:16.659> in<00:03:16.840> terms<00:03:17.049> of<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.260> instrumental<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.980> think

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
on in terms of the instrumental I think

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.830 
on in terms of the instrumental I think
that<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.489> definitely<00:03:19.000> makes<00:03:19.209> use<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.569> that

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
that it definitely makes use of that

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.199 
that it definitely makes use of that
simplistic<00:03:20.260> style<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.160> wins<00:03:21.549> me<00:03:21.760> over<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
simplistic style and wins me over as a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.330 
simplistic style and wins me over as a
result<00:03:22.660> ghost<00:03:23.049> made<00:03:23.349> it<00:03:23.470> over<00:03:23.590> from<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.949> EP

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.580 
result ghost made it over from the EP
and<00:03:24.609> for<00:03:24.819> good<00:03:25.060> reason<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.750> easily<00:03:26.049> one<00:03:26.530> of

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and for good reason it's easily one of

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.589 
and for good reason it's easily one of
the<00:03:26.709> best<00:03:26.769> songs<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.819> she's<00:03:27.970> recorded<00:03:28.480> to

something stuck inside my head and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.550 
something stuck inside my head and
that's<00:05:00.000> definitely<00:05:00.450> not<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:00.960> good<00:05:01.200> thing

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560
