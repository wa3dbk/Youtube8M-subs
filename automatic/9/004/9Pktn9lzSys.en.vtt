00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 numbers to all androids in this video 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 I'm going to show you how to install alpha 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.799
 Break 2 in our Samsung Galaxy Pocket 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.450
 this process as I said before is very 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 similar as installing all reds 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 therefore this process is going to be very 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 simple the first thing as always we have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.470
 have the rom file if all 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.470
 our memory card 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.240
 which is this alpha romeo of 2.5 and a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.530
 once I had which link o and leave it the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.540
 download link I will leave it in the 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.160
 description once we have it in 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.790
 the memory card we will pay 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.790
 our cell phone 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.090
 and already with our cell phone off we go to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.829
 enter record mode and keeping with 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 the cellphone off pressed key 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.589
 volume up more button home + button 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.589
 power 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.090
 know him 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.980
 let's alone power 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.680
 and the cell phone will enter a new record 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.690
 and I choose the web option first 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.519
 datafactory reset this means that it 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.840
 they're going to erase all our data so 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.310
 which we have to have a copy of 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.290
 security of our data if not 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.850
 we want to lose nothing we choose the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.110
 options with wolf volume key and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.820
 select by pressing button 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.860
 power 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.940
 we go down 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.940
 and let's say yes 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.890
 when all of our 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.780
 data now we are going to install the rome 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.840
 we choose the second option installed 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.850
 reports and card we select the first 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.410
 option too and we're going to look for the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 radio file in this case what 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.360
 I have in my folder and it's the first alpha 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.360
 I scored two points and selected 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 and the cell phone will start installing the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.470
 roma and ready with cell phones is over 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 will be the rom we can go backwards 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.659
 and we're going to give reboot system law and the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.130
 cellular is going to start to restart as 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 always all the first times then 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 of installing a rom 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.020
 the first restart will last a little 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.870
 but the rest of the restarts are going to be 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.580
 completely normal 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.100
 when our cell phone has restarted 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.850
 let's choose the language 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.850
 to be 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.240
 let's jump the start 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.319
 and we can already see that we have our 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.140
 installed clothing which focuses on the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 aspects of samsung galaxy s 5 like 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.739
 we can see we have a very version 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.410
 similar to a launcher but a version 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.560
 from touchwiz and we have an interface 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.720
 quite similar to s 5 as we can 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.310
 watch 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.310
 and here we have the lining 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.250
 version 2.0 here we tell you that it has 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.930
 versions in 4.4 but as always I 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 I say this is not the android version 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.150
 4.4 is a version of the 4.0 tuned 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.069
 as 4.4 as 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.959
 well I hope these tutorials these 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.700
 If there is any doubt or concern 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.590
 Do not hesitate to leave it in the comments 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.590
 thank you very much for watching and see you later
