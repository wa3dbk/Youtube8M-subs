00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.570
 Hello again friends because youtube 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.160
 Here I am going to show you a room that 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:23.060
 happened that is based on the living is 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:29.450
 a being game boat 10 that is based 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.829
 in android 4.1.1 then right now 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.780
 I'm going to show you what the bot of 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.780
 animation we are going to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.990
 to flip her over so they can see more or less 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.330
 as he is doing it he has very 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.250
 nice goal of animation nothing but the 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.060
 you break as it is in beta 1 phase 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.400
 has many bugs many looks does not bring 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.200
 the camera does not bring administrator 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.930
 files the bluetooth is not 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.700
 working well 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.770
 but well I say it's normal to be 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.480
 the first version of this rom to isabel 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.640
 wood of animation 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.640
 if you can see it, it looks very nice 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 with the logo 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.310
 from sian owen 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 more that there is a mark that is 9 and good in 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.780
 this case is 10 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.330
 that probably still do not have it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.630
 ready and they put it this version 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.640
 there is already inside and as you can see 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.490
 well he obviously has 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.490
 the screen of the living and it shows 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.130
 obviously not like there is no camera 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.130
 will send us an error 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.159
 who did not find the bed 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.490
 although apparently you see that he wants 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.950
 enter camera mode no 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.170
 that we usually pay 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 if we want to enter the governed also 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.330
 he will not be able to enter, he will send us 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.540
 an error that the application has had 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.780
 obviously the only thing that is 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.780
 working 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.640
 is there 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 the screens that already more or less to 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.060
 install and some widgets here are 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.430
 the markers 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.650
 of the browsers yes yes they are 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.650
 working well the youtube equal 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.230
 here yes it is taking a little bit in 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.840
 connect to wifi I imagine that so 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.330
 same has some problems and it is because 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.489
 there but if you get to connect and no no 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.630
 I have connection problems until 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.810
 right now 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.200
 brings here a gallery of her the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.910
 living room 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.680
 the new one 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.160
 well these are the only photos that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.160
 I have out there 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.170
 but the gallery is working well 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.220
 does not have problems until now 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.220
 here it is 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.590
 Dr. Martin 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.990
 that is working well that well the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.860
 music brings us the video producer 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.860
 still 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:42.300
 and we can see them the widgets that the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.720
 the room are very few basic 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.740
 yes 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.560
 and we see the play store that obviously does not 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.960
 is configured to be able to access the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.180
 play store 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.370
 like when I still do not connect to the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.370
 wifi and you have a little bit of time 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.930
 that I lit it the good battery 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.980
 apparently if it is 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.980
 a little bit 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.990
 got off fast I had it in 100 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.190
 obviously it was not well charged but 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.570
 apparently if you are consuming a 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.079
 little bit of battery I think those 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.409
 fingers 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.909
 Problems that have to be corrected 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:27.060
 still can not connect to wifi there 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:30.500
 it's late that I'm going to take it away I'm going to 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.290
 reconnect know if ignited 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.139
 and well, I just wanted to teach them 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.960
 quickly 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.479
 obviously he still needs a lot to be 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.349
 with but good let's see what it brings 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.349
 it's very good 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.599
 and then it's working fine that's not 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.599
 have a problem 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.990
 here is 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.639
 and well obviously, it has 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.120
 details that have to go 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.950
 correcting as they go out 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.050
 updates and still offline 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.900
 I believe that avoiding is not going to connect 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.620
 but I do know if I know if he's connected 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.260
 right now I 've been checking 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.230
 but hey, I just wanted to teach you like that 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.380
 a quick view 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.160
 here for example are these widgets that 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.160
 are those that can be inserted into 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.740
 screens already from which the incident 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.210
 it is here the time is the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.639
 music player 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.680
 up to the markers and here is the 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.080
 calendar 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.440
 it's the calendar that I moved very 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.450
 no joke 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.450
 and well you can also this 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.880
 put in this case wallpapers 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.520
 animated 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.810
 that brings all these that are basically 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.550
 those of screen sandwich 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.610
 these are working well without 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.689
 no problem 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.689
 there are the bubbles 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.259
 and if we select it 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.440
 the history 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.840
 is a bit slow has the chs by 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:19.220
 obvious reasons that of course is still 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.690
 a process that they configure it well 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.200
 there the hard thing that inadvertently 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.200
 connects 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.510
 here for example if you if you give us all 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.510
 very much if we put the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.250
 animated wallpapers in this 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.569
 good case then let's put the 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.390
 that brings from there the living 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.880
 there is a good gallery 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.700
 for example right now with animated background 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.980
 I already know 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.550
 and that position a little slow 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.550
 and this already 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.790
 either slow so for the same 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.830
 that is not yet 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.350
 at 100 this tree 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.120
 but hey it's not I wanted to show you how 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.169
 how are you working and what more or less 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.680
 they saw the appearance of 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:11.020
 how is this room that is already 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.840
 that they leave it to one hundred percent because it goes 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.430
 to be the best that there will be for 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.430
 the galaxy s2 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:32.940
 good friends nothing else I wanted to show you 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:35.300
 how is this are in beta for 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.410

 you are watching me or how are you 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.290

 and good for those who have already downloaded it and 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:47.570
