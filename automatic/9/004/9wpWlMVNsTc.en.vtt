00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
you know it's an air-raid siren so it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.870 
you know it's an air-raid siren so it's
a<00:02:15.860> test<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.640> for<00:02:16.940> an<00:02:17.150> attack<00:02:17.780> from<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.709> air<00:02:19.340> I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
a test like for an attack from the air I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.300 
a test like for an attack from the air I

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
guess they're probably just testing make

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.490 
guess they're probably just testing make
sure<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.700> siren<00:02:23.150> works<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.690> doing<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.140> drill

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
sure the siren works and doing a drill

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.740 
sure the siren works and doing a drill
just<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.550> do<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> fire<00:02:26.090> drill<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.599> high

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
just like you do a fire drill in high

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.050 
just like you do a fire drill in high
school<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:28.310> uh<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.959> thing<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.910> usually<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
school but uh the thing is usually you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.610 
school but uh the thing is usually you
know<00:02:32.239> there's<00:02:32.480> going<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.870> fire<00:02:33.170> drill<00:02:33.470> I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't know what's going on right now so
it<00:02:35.569> makes<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> little<00:02:36.290> nervous

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.610 

it<00:02:43.890> sounds<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.549> winding<00:02:44.849> down

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.100 

there<00:02:53.250> must<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> end<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> drill<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.869 
there must be the end of the drill it
was<00:02:55.230> different<00:02:55.500> than<00:02:55.860> before<00:02:56.340> usually<00:02:56.549> it

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
was different than before usually it

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.650 
was different than before usually it
goes

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.780 

up<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.900> down<00:03:01.080> at<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.950> time<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.340> stayed

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
up and down at that time I just stayed

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.150 
up and down at that time I just stayed
at<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.270> high<00:03:03.450> pitch<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.620> whole<00:03:04.800> time<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
at the high pitch for the whole time and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.460 
at the high pitch for the whole time and
then<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.580> went<00:03:05.790> down<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.110> think<00:03:07.170> that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
then just went down so I think that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.530 
then just went down so I think that
seagulls<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.220> I'll<00:03:08.580> go<00:03:08.760> up<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> roof<00:03:09.330> and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
seagulls and I'll go up on the roof and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.870 
seagulls and I'll go up on the roof and
