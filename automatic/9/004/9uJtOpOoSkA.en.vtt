00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
example the pc version of that was

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.300 
example the pc version of that was
released<00:01:08.640> nearly<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.450> month<00:01:09.750> later<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:10.920> every

they<00:01:14.670> didn't<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.180> come<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.439> why

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
they didn't really come out and say why

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310 
they didn't really come out and say why
the<00:01:16.799> pc<00:01:17.400> version<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:18.030> delayed<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.080> month

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the pc version was delayed for a month

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.310 
the pc version was delayed for a month
