the number-one reason to see this film
the<00:01:41.560> film's<00:01:42.069> focus<00:01:42.489> is<00:01:42.700> mainly<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.569> Apes<00:01:43.810> I

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
the film's focus is mainly on the Apes I

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.199 
the film's focus is mainly on the Apes I
thought<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.800> would<00:01:44.950> be<00:01:45.069> like<00:01:45.250> Apes<00:01:45.550> v<00:01:45.849> you<00:01:46.060> know

thought it would be like Apes v you know

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:47.969 
thought it would be like Apes v you know
you<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.690> them<00:01:46.869> as<00:01:46.989> supporting<00:01:47.500> roles<00:01:47.709> but

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
you see them as supporting roles but

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.949 
you see them as supporting roles but
it's<00:01:48.369> really<00:01:48.849> about<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.239> humans<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:49.869> what

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810
