00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.640 

hi<00:00:08.460> everyone<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.210> Peter<00:00:09.450> today<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.290> want

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
hi everyone this is Peter today I want

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.410 
hi everyone this is Peter today I want
to<00:00:10.740> introduce<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.759> Sony<00:00:12.120> pxw<00:00:13.080> X<00:00:13.639> 180<00:00:14.639> so

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
to introduce is the Sony pxw X 180 so

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.070 
to introduce is the Sony pxw X 180 so
other<00:00:15.719> than<00:00:15.960> X<00:00:16.170> 180<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.070> also<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.880> X<00:00:18.240> 160

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
other than X 180 you also got the X 160

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.189 
other than X 180 you also got the X 160
so<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.859> difference<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.880> between<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.330> 160<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
so the difference in between is 160 is

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.679 
so the difference in between is 160 is
without<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.100> Wi-Fi<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> 180<00:00:24.539> is

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
without the Wi-Fi and then the 180 is

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.400 
without the Wi-Fi and then the 180 is
with<00:00:25.260> Wi-Fi<00:00:25.830> ok<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.939> camera<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.199> I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
with Wi-Fi ok so this camera for me I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.400 
with Wi-Fi ok so this camera for me I
would<00:00:28.830> say<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> combinations<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.140> an

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
would say it's is a combinations of an

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.770 
would say it's is a combinations of an
x5<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.640> also<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.290> pmw<00:00:35.090> 150<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.540> upgrade

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
x5 and also the pmw 150 and then upgrade

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.819 
x5 and also the pmw 150 and then upgrade
it<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> lower<00:00:38.520> compression<00:00:38.960> codec<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.649> why

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it into a lower compression codec so why

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
it into a lower compression codec so why
I<00:00:40.860> say<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.450> camcorder<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I say that is because this camcorder is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.869 
I say that is because this camcorder is
now<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.489> record<00:00:45.020> xav<00:00:46.020> C<00:00:46.230> intra<00:00:46.800> X<00:00:47.039> alias<00:00:47.610> long

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
now can record xav C intra X alias long

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720 
now can record xav C intra X alias long
got<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> same<00:00:48.629> time<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
got at the same time you can down to the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
got at the same time you can down to the
PM<00:00:50.969> double<00:00:51.180> series<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> HD<00:00:52.350> 42

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
PM double series which is the HD 42

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.389 
PM double series which is the HD 42
impact<00:00:53.579> impact<00:00:54.530> 250<00:00:55.530> map<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:55.829> per<00:00:55.920> second<00:00:56.280> and

impact impact 250 map bit per second and
even<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.600> into<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:59.370> AVC<00:00:59.910> HD

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
even you can go down into the the AVC HD

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
even you can go down into the the AVC HD
which<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.320> codec<00:01:01.680> from<00:01:01.879> nx5<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:05.000> for

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
which is the codec from nx5 so for

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.190 
which is the codec from nx5 so for
example<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.200> camcorder<00:01:07.830> itself

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
example like the the camcorder itself

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
example like the the camcorder itself
the<00:01:10.200> recording<00:01:10.680> media<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.250> still<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> same

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the recording media is still the same

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.260 
the recording media is still the same
you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.979> SBS<00:01:14.340> card<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you can use them the the SBS card and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.230 
you can use them the the SBS card and
then<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.140> same<00:01:16.290> time<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.909> SD

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
then at the same time you got the the SD

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
then at the same time you got the the SD
card<00:01:18.540> slot<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.500> doing<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
card slot which you can doing the you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.330 
card slot which you can doing the you
can<00:01:20.759> record<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> SD<00:01:21.650> proxy<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
can record to the SD proxy on to this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.070 
can record to the SD proxy on to this
slot<00:01:23.909> which<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.979> only<00:01:26.159> support<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
slot which is the can only support the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.280 
slot which is the can only support the
the<00:01:28.080> H<00:01:28.229> dot<00:01:28.439> 264<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> mpeg-4<00:01:30.270> functions<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the H dot 264 so is mpeg-4 functions and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
the H dot 264 so is mpeg-4 functions and
if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.570> AVC

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
if you want to have like the the AVC

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.620 
if you want to have like the the AVC
intra<00:01:34.140> AVC<00:01:34.740> longer<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.400> maybe<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> HD<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.509> 2

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
intra AVC longer or maybe the HD for 2

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
intra AVC longer or maybe the HD for 2
250<00:01:37.259> ml<00:01:37.409> p<00:01:37.560> per<00:01:37.710> seconds<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> use<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
250 ml p per seconds you have to use the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.429 
250 ml p per seconds you have to use the
XS<00:01:39.900> bias-cut

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
XS bias-cut

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.810 
XS bias-cut
but<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.119> s<00:01:42.240> best<00:01:42.450> card<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:43.200> record

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
but now the s best card can record

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.190 
but now the s best card can record
simultaneously<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.030> also<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.020> let

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
simultaneously and also you can just let

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.550 
simultaneously and also you can just let
jump<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.009> 1<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.549> 2<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> full<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> think

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
jump to 1 to 2 if it is full so I think

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.940 
jump to 1 to 2 if it is full so I think
this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.250> strong<00:01:50.670> recommend<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.540> 2<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this is I'm strong recommend to 2 if you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
this is I'm strong recommend to 2 if you
are<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.280> using<00:01:53.579> maybe<00:01:54.000> recall<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> long

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
are not using maybe recall it for a long

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.700 
are not using maybe recall it for a long
period<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> time

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
period of time

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
period of time
just<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.759> two<00:01:57.000> cards<00:01:57.210> together<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.960> then

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
just put two cards together and then

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.020 
just put two cards together and then
maybe<00:01:58.439> Cemal<00:01:58.920> taneous<00:01:59.189> recording<00:01:59.700> because

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
maybe Cemal taneous recording because

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.719 
maybe Cemal taneous recording because
sometimes<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> never<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.009> giver<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
sometimes you never know if a giver if a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
sometimes you never know if a giver if a
media<00:02:03.000> gone<00:02:03.299> wrong<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.229> least<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
media gone wrong and then at least you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.100 
media gone wrong and then at least you
still<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:05.040> another<00:02:05.399> copy<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.479> case<00:02:06.659> so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
still have another copy just in case so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.190 
still have another copy just in case so
it's<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:08.340> happy<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.179> start<00:02:09.720> from<00:02:09.840> NX

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's very happy that like start from NX

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's very happy that like start from NX
v<00:02:10.470> &amp;<00:02:10.830> NX<00:02:11.400> free<00:02:11.700> from<00:02:12.150> Sony<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.540> then

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
v &amp; NX free from Sony and then

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.500 
v &amp; NX free from Sony and then
or<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.980> camera<00:02:14.340> which<00:02:14.670> launched<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.450> year

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
or the camera which launched this year

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.070 
or the camera which launched this year
is<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.670> functions<00:02:18.080> so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
is now have this kind of functions so

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.809 
is now have this kind of functions so
other<00:02:19.349> than<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.340> got<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
other than this and then you got like a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.240 
other than this and then you got like a
quite<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.270> numbers<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> connections<00:02:22.709> for

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
quite a numbers of connections for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.780 
quite a numbers of connections for
example<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.940> got<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.330> 3G<00:02:24.750> SDI<00:02:25.110> BNC

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
example like you got the 3G SDI BNC

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.270 
example like you got the 3G SDI BNC
output<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.239> got<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> TC<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.410> got<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
output you got the TC you got the the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.339 
output you got the TC you got the the
gen<00:02:29.459> lock<00:02:29.700> which<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.209> can<00:02:30.420> using<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.870> camera

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
gen lock which you can using this camera

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.620 
gen lock which you can using this camera
to<00:02:31.680> connect<00:02:32.069> with<00:02:32.250> several<00:02:32.700> units<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.330> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
to connect with several units of a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.540 
to connect with several units of a
visual<00:02:34.200> mixer<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.130> use<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.430> as

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
visual mixer and then you can use it as

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.449 
visual mixer and then you can use it as
a<00:02:36.000> kind<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.690> maybe<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.200> minimal<00:02:38.040> OB

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
a kind of like maybe a minimal OB

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.240 
a kind of like maybe a minimal OB
situations<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.500> other<00:02:40.500> than<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.010> still

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
situations and other than that you still

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.970 
situations and other than that you still
got<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.150> HDMI<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.140> then<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.830> then

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
got like the the HDMI and then and then

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490 
got like the the HDMI and then and then
this<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.910> prop<00:02:45.150> CSD<00:02:45.930> which<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.440> know

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this is the the prop CSD which I know

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.120 
this is the the prop CSD which I know
that<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.810> should<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.860> light

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that this is a should be a kind of light

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.240 
that this is a should be a kind of light
maybe<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.400> firmware<00:02:50.730> upgrade<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:52.410> other<00:02:53.130> than

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
maybe a firmware upgrade so other than

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.850 
maybe a firmware upgrade so other than
that<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.819> then<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.260> said<00:02:55.680> they

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that and then because as I said they

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.259 
that and then because as I said they
have<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.430> many<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:57.000> me<00:02:57.120> beer

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
have for so many like me beer

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.330 
have for so many like me beer
combinations<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.319> between<00:02:58.680> induce<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
combinations in between induce this

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.059 
combinations in between induce this
camera<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.480> size<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.200> camera<00:03:01.500> your

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
camera so the size of this camera your

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.809 
camera so the size of this camera your
funnel<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.700> slightly<00:03:03.799> large<00:03:04.799> then<00:03:05.250> maybe<00:03:05.549> and

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
funnel is slightly large then maybe and

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.940 
funnel is slightly large then maybe and
then<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> previous<00:03:06.569> versions<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.349> at<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
then the previous versions and at the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.740 
then the previous versions and at the
same<00:03:08.190> time<00:03:08.430> because<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.880> slightly<00:03:09.239> larger

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
same time because it's slightly larger

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.380 
same time because it's slightly larger
and<00:03:10.260> then<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.769> weight<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.430> also<00:03:12.060> slightly

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
and then the weight is also slightly

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.080 
and then the weight is also slightly
heavier<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.590> talking<00:03:13.860> about<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.340> five<00:03:14.670> on

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
heavier it's talking about like five on

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750 
heavier it's talking about like five on
two<00:03:15.510> pounds<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.890> which<00:03:17.130> i<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.430> is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
two pounds and then which i think is

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.539 
two pounds and then which i think is
slightly<00:03:18.090> more<00:03:18.540> heavy<00:03:19.230> than<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.859> normal<00:03:20.340> D

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
slightly more heavy than the normal D

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.539 
slightly more heavy than the normal D
and<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> other<00:03:20.880> camcorder<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:23.280> other

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
and the other camcorder and but other

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.400 
and the other camcorder and but other
than<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.820> they<00:03:24.150> still<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> lot<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.170> good

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
than that they still have a lot of good

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.370 
than that they still have a lot of good
functions<00:03:25.920> which<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.250> compensate<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
functions which can compensate the the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.220 
functions which can compensate the the
weight<00:03:28.590> for<00:03:29.340> example<00:03:29.910> you've<00:03:30.569> got<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
weight for example you've got like a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.819 
weight for example you've got like a
very<00:03:33.590> nice<00:03:34.970> qualities<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.239> all<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.019> will

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
very nice qualities of all it will

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.460 
very nice qualities of all it will
finder<00:03:38.310> which<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.090> half<00:03:39.390> inch<00:03:39.720> OLED<00:03:40.140> more

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
finder which is the half inch OLED more

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.069 
finder which is the half inch OLED more
arm<00:03:40.709> will<00:03:41.220> Vander<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.720> lot

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
arm will Vander I think like for a lot

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.930 
arm will Vander I think like for a lot
of<00:03:43.170> situations<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:44.190> then<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.489> people<00:03:44.700> will

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
of situations and then the people will

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.970 
of situations and then the people will
complain<00:03:45.180> about<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:46.049> okay<00:03:46.350> oh<00:03:46.500> yeah<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.829> I

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
complain about like okay oh yeah you I

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.099 
complain about like okay oh yeah you I
got<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> very<00:03:47.639> good<00:03:47.940> life<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.420> we'll<00:03:48.630> find<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
got a very good life but we'll find the

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.860 
got a very good life but we'll find the
LCD<00:03:49.980> more<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.579> front<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.660> wheel

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
LCD more in the front but the wheel

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.259 
LCD more in the front but the wheel
wonder<00:03:52.319> at<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.650> back<00:03:52.829> is<00:03:53.040> useless<00:03:53.819> but<00:03:54.090> this

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
wonder at the back is useless but this

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.660 
wonder at the back is useless but this
one<00:03:54.450> definitely<00:03:55.079> good<00:03:55.590> qualities<00:03:56.069> for<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.370> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670

can get the the better scoop the

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.660 
can get the the better scoop the
histogram<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.560> waveform<00:04:10.980> which<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.340> very

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
histogram the the waveform which is very

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.879 
histogram the the waveform which is very
good<00:04:11.880> because<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.359> more<00:04:12.660> user-friendly<00:04:13.079> but

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
good because it's more user-friendly but

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.969 
good because it's more user-friendly but
I<00:04:13.950> think<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.549> key<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.600> key<00:04:15.630> factor<00:04:16.440> why<00:04:16.950> I

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
I think the key the key factor why I

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.509 
I think the key the key factor why I
want<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.669> buy<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.180> camcorder<00:04:18.539> is<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
want to buy this camcorder is the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.810 
want to buy this camcorder is the
optical<00:04:21.000> zoom<00:04:21.140> because<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.530> camera<00:04:23.099> I<00:04:23.430> think

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
optical zoom because this camera I think

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.310 
optical zoom because this camera I think
is<00:04:23.909> the<00:04:24.090> first<00:04:24.950> compact

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
is the first compact

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.110 
is the first compact
which<00:04:26.590> can<00:04:26.950> get<00:04:27.310> 25<00:04:28.200> times<00:04:29.280> optical<00:04:30.280> zoom<00:04:30.310> so

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
which can get 25 times optical zoom so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.110 
which can get 25 times optical zoom so
when<00:04:31.390> if<00:04:31.510> I<00:04:31.630> find<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.290> how<00:04:32.620> is<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.550> encryption

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
when if I find so how is it encryption

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.910 
when if I find so how is it encryption
to<00:04:34.270> 35mm<00:04:35.170> so<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:36.130> 26<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.590> 650

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
to 35mm so this is 26 to 650

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.570 
to 35mm so this is 26 to 650
optical<00:04:39.820> zoom<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.720> oh<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.710> very<00:04:42.100> like

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
optical zoom so oh this is very like

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.570 
optical zoom so oh this is very like
maybe<00:04:42.760> wide<00:04:43.360> range<00:04:43.690> which<00:04:44.140> i<00:04:44.320> think<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.950> bad<00:04:45.250> is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
maybe wide range which i think is bad is

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.480 
maybe wide range which i think is bad is
good<00:04:45.970> for<00:04:46.240> news<00:04:46.690> good<00:04:47.440> for<00:04:47.740> event<00:04:48.160> because

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
good for news good for event because

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.430 
good for news good for event because
sometimes<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.120> may<00:04:49.450> be<00:04:49.480> you<00:04:50.020> are<00:04:50.140> in<00:04:50.320> the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
sometimes you may be you are in the

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.110 
sometimes you may be you are in the
stack<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.070> stadium<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.640> want<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:51.910> do<00:04:52.090> a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
stack of the stadium you want to do a

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.460 
stack of the stadium you want to do a
wide<00:04:52.420> shot<00:04:52.450> at<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.840> same<00:04:52.990> time<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.290> want<00:04:53.440> to

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
wide shot at the same time you want to

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.410 
wide shot at the same time you want to
zoom<00:04:53.710> or<00:04:53.920> maybe<00:04:54.070> close<00:04:54.610> up<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.970> maybe<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.240> miss

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
zoom or maybe close up to maybe I miss

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.450 
zoom or maybe close up to maybe I miss
shot<00:04:55.660> when<00:04:55.960> they<00:04:56.110> when<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.710> when<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.220> guy<00:04:57.400> is

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
shot when they when the when the guy is

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.640 
shot when they when the when the guy is
just<00:04:57.820> having<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.360> speech<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.080> people<00:04:59.170> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
just having a speech to the people and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.830 
just having a speech to the people and
then<00:04:59.800> I<00:04:59.950> think<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.550> camcorder<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:01.360> that

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
then I think this camcorder is that

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.840 
then I think this camcorder is that
actually<00:05:02.350> very<00:05:02.530> good<00:05:02.650> because<00:05:02.830> before<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.670> I

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
actually very good because before that I

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.550 
actually very good because before that I
heard<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.180> lot<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.570> like<00:05:04.810> maybe<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> comment

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
heard a lot of like maybe a comment

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.040 
heard a lot of like maybe a comment
about<00:05:05.890> okay<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.790> Sony<00:05:07.420> camera<00:05:07.840> normally

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
about okay the the Sony camera normally

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.440 
about okay the the Sony camera normally
they<00:05:08.410> can<00:05:08.620> give<00:05:08.890> you<00:05:09.100> maybe<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.460> very<00:05:09.790> maybe

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
they can give you maybe a very maybe

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.330 
they can give you maybe a very maybe
sort<00:05:10.750> range<00:05:11.020> which<00:05:11.350> maybe<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.710> have<00:05:11.920> to<00:05:12.040> put<00:05:12.190> on

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
sort range which maybe I have to put on

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.280 
sort range which maybe I have to put on
the<00:05:12.490> teleconverter<00:05:13.180> or<00:05:13.330> maybe<00:05:13.510> I<00:05:13.720> have<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.110> put

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
the teleconverter or maybe I have to put

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.140 
the teleconverter or maybe I have to put
our<00:05:14.410> wine<00:05:14.620> go<00:05:14.980> to<00:05:15.040> make<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.370> wider<00:05:15.670> but<00:05:16.000> now

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
our wine go to make it wider but now

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.240 
our wine go to make it wider but now
this<00:05:16.420> camcorder<00:05:16.690> if<00:05:17.080> give<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.650> everything's

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
this camcorder if give you everything's

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.370 
this camcorder if give you everything's
and<00:05:18.490> then<00:05:19.090> other<00:05:19.300> than<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.660> is<00:05:19.930> something

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
and then other than that is something

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.760 
and then other than that is something
which<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.590> special<00:05:21.280> for<00:05:21.430> me<00:05:21.580> is<00:05:21.790> a<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:22.330> the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
which is special for me is a is the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.590 
which is special for me is a is the
variable<00:05:23.770> nd<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:26.040> normally<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.340> most<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.420> the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
variable nd the normally the most of the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.560 
variable nd the normally the most of the
camcorder<00:05:29.230> you<00:05:29.350> have<00:05:29.440> like<00:05:29.950> maybe<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.300> step<00:05:31.300> and

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
camcorder you have like maybe a step and

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.620 
camcorder you have like maybe a step and
D<00:05:32.020> which<00:05:32.290> is<00:05:32.320> maybe<00:05:33.070> is<00:05:33.640> not<00:05:33.700> really<00:05:34.420> useful

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
D which is maybe is not really useful

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.020 
D which is maybe is not really useful
when<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.380> are<00:05:35.410> especially<00:05:35.980> for<00:05:36.340> shots<00:05:36.610> like<00:05:36.820> I

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
when you are especially for shots like I

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.990 
when you are especially for shots like I
want<00:05:37.390> to<00:05:37.480> shoot<00:05:37.870> indoor<00:05:38.800> pen<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.370> an<00:05:39.520> outdoor

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
want to shoot indoor pen to an outdoor

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.810 
want to shoot indoor pen to an outdoor
area<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.780> then<00:05:40.930> maybe<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:41.680> might<00:05:41.710> an<00:05:42.220> all<00:05:42.550> in

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
area and then maybe you might an all in

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.760 
area and then maybe you might an all in
between<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.630> you<00:05:43.720> might<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.140> to<00:05:44.260> put<00:05:44.440> on<00:05:44.620> the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
between and you might have to put on the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.160 
between and you might have to put on the
nd<00:05:45.100> on<00:05:45.130> but<00:05:45.550> which<00:05:45.730> is<00:05:45.880> not<00:05:46.090> smooth<00:05:46.420> for<00:05:46.990> for

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
nd on but which is not smooth for for

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.620 
nd on but which is not smooth for for
now<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.440> very<00:05:47.800> variable<00:05:48.520> nd<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.300> can<00:05:49.480> have

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
now the very variable nd you can have

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.100 
now the very variable nd you can have
very<00:05:50.140> smooth<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.240> close-up<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.450> ND<00:05:52.780> and

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
very smooth and the close-up and ND and

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.080 
very smooth and the close-up and ND and
then<00:05:53.290> for<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.770> air<00:05:53.890> for<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.160> shots<00:05:54.370> which<00:05:54.910> is

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
then for the air for the shots which is

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.270 
then for the air for the shots which is
I<00:05:55.240> think<00:05:55.270> is<00:05:55.690> quite<00:05:55.930> useful<00:05:56.230> of<00:05:56.650> although<00:05:56.950> it's

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
I think is quite useful of although it's

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.610 
I think is quite useful of although it's
not<00:05:57.580> using<00:05:58.150> all<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.450> time<00:05:58.900> but<00:05:59.140> at<00:05:59.260> least<00:05:59.410> it

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
not using all the time but at least it

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.040 
not using all the time but at least it
gives<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.340> such<00:06:00.670> kind<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.180> function<00:06:01.840> which

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
gives you such kind of function which

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.250 
gives you such kind of function which
you<00:06:02.170> need<00:06:02.320> and<00:06:02.610> but<00:06:03.610> only<00:06:03.640> maybe<00:06:04.450> downside<00:06:05.050> for

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
you need and but only maybe downside for

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.790 
you need and but only maybe downside for
me<00:06:05.290> for<00:06:05.590> this<00:06:05.740> camera<00:06:05.980> is<00:06:06.280> this<00:06:06.790> is<00:06:06.970> still<00:06:07.180> a

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
me for this camera is this is still a

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.640 
me for this camera is this is still a
1/3<00:06:08.800> inch<00:06:09.240> CMOS<00:06:10.240> sensor<00:06:10.750> it's<00:06:11.110> not<00:06:11.350> a<00:06:11.380> half

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
1/3 inch CMOS sensor it's not a half

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.130 
1/3 inch CMOS sensor it's not a half
inch<00:06:11.950> or<00:06:12.190> maybe<00:06:12.310> bigger<00:06:12.610> size<00:06:12.910> but<00:06:13.330> I<00:06:13.510> think

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
inch or maybe bigger size but I think

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.980 
inch or maybe bigger size but I think
the<00:06:14.260> photo<00:06:14.440> functions<00:06:15.070> for<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.490> price<00:06:15.850> that

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
the photo functions for the price that

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.260 
the photo functions for the price that
Sony<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.110> over<00:06:17.560> e<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.860> think<00:06:18.340> this<00:06:18.490> is<00:06:18.640> probably

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
Sony is over e I think this is probably

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.660 
Sony is over e I think this is probably
like<00:06:19.900> maybe<00:06:20.050> is<00:06:20.350> good<00:06:20.560> enough<00:06:20.890> for<00:06:20.950> a<00:06:21.280> lot<00:06:21.550> of

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
like maybe is good enough for a lot of

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.090 
like maybe is good enough for a lot of
people<00:06:22.060> especially<00:06:22.570> for<00:06:23.050> as<00:06:23.200> I<00:06:23.350> said<00:06:23.560> for<00:06:23.770> news

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100
