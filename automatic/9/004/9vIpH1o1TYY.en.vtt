00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.459
 In addition, it is not such a position. 

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:08.320
 We have an account of car inspection source on 10th, but everybody is ah 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.599
 Don't think about anything here-in the admin account 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.820
 I think that I use windows 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.240
 It is done in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.400
 My 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.980
 If you would like to ask for advice, here is the limit 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.609
 I think you created an account 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.050
 Yamaguchi Ken Fist and Behavior Style 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 Spreading structure 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.160
 It is this one 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.640
 Yeah, you are right 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.010
 Restricted 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.180
 Using the Internet by Account 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 I want 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 Estimated cause of login status with account 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 Big 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.749
 Same town association 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.749
 I don't know what i am saying 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.680
 Well, I will do seven for the time being 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.770
 This way 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.130
 Unification-maia with high prosecution PC 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.840
 Increases 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.890
 Though it is 22 cases 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 Well, for now 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.990
 This is a service 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 At that time 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.730
 But it was right 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 Actually it will be about the same as before 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.420
 I'm trying to make a virus and I can't access my power 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.840
 Blood line 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.180
 But with this port 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.450
 Is it 3. 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 It is single-shot type 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.240
 Troy of Statistics Agency to just start again from now on 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.980
 Though it is a wooden horse 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.780
 This is also done with the so-called administrator right, which is the definitive server2 system 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.870
 What do you mean 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.870
 It works without installing 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.299
 There are also things, so I have no choice 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.649
 You're welcome 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.969
 others 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.289
 It will be great 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.429
 I think it was the same year, but I think 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.359
 I wonder if I did this 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.509
 So this is 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.729
 how is it 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.449
 There is a part that steals an online game account 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.449
 It seems 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.949
 Perhaps you want this carbon steel administrator to execute 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.949
 It is said that 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.379
 It does not move 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.419
 It is a virus that such a scene is reversed 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.789
 Become 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.759
 Walk this 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.449
 I think so but 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.939
 What did you say? 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.579
 Until now 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.579
 You're on the desktop 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.579
 I want this too 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.659
 I think this band is great 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.899
 Ando family 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.809
 Be fourth 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:30.539
 I can not dance regularly hybridpower in spring 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.899
 That's all 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.519
 And this is a part of the fist fist and Kanto 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 I think I can disappear now 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.149
 You're male and female 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.969
 I did that 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.969
 Let's do a little virus inspection 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.309
 Yes you seem to say strange things 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.559
 I think it's a little bit of action 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.149
 Well, there is no need to uninstall mcafee 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.149
 What is a virus inspection tool 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.499
 Let's keep moving this way for a moment 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.379
 Assume 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:21.049
 I grew up to Heket and tested outside the prefecture 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.539
 You can't see anything at all 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.219
 We went to Yamase supermarket or Mise which is the largest in Jarrett 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.279
 Right 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.909
 Lost 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.509
 I wonder if it's going to go wrong and what happened 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.740
 I think it is very difficult to see 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.229
 For example, being a star 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.340
 Bite 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.490
 Process this strange application 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.340
 I love you 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.290
 I can not see 4 cards with fa etc but I miss 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.150
 It is considered as this kind of thickened 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.749
 Wool This is a virus, but the data is accounting 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:05.949
 This rumor 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.320
 Look at the market horses infected with the so-called virus 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.020
 Is the easiest to understand virus 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.220
 I always test this, but with limitations 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.559
 It is a count that meets 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:22.080
 Restricted by users viewed in the park 

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:24.490
 I'm working with my account 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.729
 This is Sanrio's low price administraton Konami 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.240
 It is ter 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.259
 Yes, this virus is a computer with admin rights 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.389
 We will carry out a briefing session 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.319
 Street 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.870
 It will be less than 4th place of small size high, but now 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.870
 It is a head error 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.909
 ja Takoika of Kochi will live 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.430
 I think it moved now 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.499
 But i think 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:56.419
 There is nothing in particular 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.279
 Clouds 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.800
 I always get something on startup with Tako Ika Gok Gok Gok 

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:04.979
 It's hard to say 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.979
 You are the partner who got here 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.399
 It seems like you're trying to get this guy 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.520
 Those 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 It's just 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.960
 How does it happen? 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.830
 The so-called information obtained by this limited account 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.690
 It is a good point that it does not get infected
