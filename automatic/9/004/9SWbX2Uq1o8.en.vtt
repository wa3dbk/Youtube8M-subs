00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.290
 but hello dear friends with you i am 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.080
 john angie and today we'll talk about 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.379
 watch dogs and i think we will discuss 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.539
 several interesting questions and come to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.480
 the general opinion of the room is it worth it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 play this game and tell you right away 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 Well, let's start with the fact that everyone is very 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 interested in the question of how much 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.140
 similar to gta5 at one time is yubisoft 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 delayed the exit watch dogs 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.079
 for half a year due to the fact that most likely 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 because gta 5 came out because there wasnâ€™t 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.899
 meaning to compete with such a huge 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.270
 a gaming industry giant like grand 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.180
 theft auto and i think this solution 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.210
 absolutely correct and adequate and that we 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.340
 used to do in grand theft auto 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.000
 to place genocide on the machines 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.640
 population just bacchanal chase with 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.189
 by the police and the like I don't say that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.579
 that there is no watch dogs 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.159
 it is also present but then the seriousness 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.310
 which everything is served around enough 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.130
 interesting start with the fact that if you 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.709
 You will behave badly and then gaming world 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.579
 namely the very population of this world will be 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.179
 to treat you 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:27.359
 negatively and if you will commit 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.520
 good deeds then naturally about you 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.009
 will speak well and even if you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.459
 then do something that is not very 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.730
 good people well something will close on 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.040
 of this 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.790
 also the open world itself is rejoicing in it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.450
 really have something to do yourself 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.650
 people deliver a lot of fun in 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.540
 that they behave enough 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.660
 realistically is reacting to the fact that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.470
 happens communicate between themselves and 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.850
 and I do not know what will happen next whether 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.290
 all this is repeated well what I saw 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.479
 in the short time I had 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.360
 play the game me more than 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.360
 impressed by this rather unusual experience 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.340
 so worry that 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.500
 experience received from watch dogs 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.070
 will remind you what was somewhere 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 five 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.100
 I think it's not worth it because this game 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.540
 perceived quite differently well as 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.750
 at least I think so and I played gta 5 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.660
 well, I understand and say enough 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 interesting question in terms of graphic 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.709
 performance of the game you know at e3 2012 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.810
 years when I first saw watch dogs 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:51.050
 she just blew my mind 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.600
 it looked like it was incredible graphics 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.130
 was very tech well at least 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 she looked like that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.739
 you know it seemed that our computers 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.230
 at that time explicit and not tucked up and in 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.780
 principle from some points of view in 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.470
 optimization plan she and again about 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.780
 This graphically the game looks like 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.320
 today is not bad but not 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.620
 grand and if she came out in 2012 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.080
 then it would be a real hit 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.310
 which would hit absolutely everyone and 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.580
 plot and technology and has 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.340
 however, it is now 2014 and the game is 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.170
 to today's standards looks fine but 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.760
 no more 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.190
 in terms of optimizing tell me 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.560
 nothing special I checked the game on 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.880
 several computers of different power and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.520
 I will say something like 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.550
 my computer game is at maximum 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.970
 the settings behaves quite to yourself 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.150
 adequately produces about 40 50 fps 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.650
 very good and quite enough 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.490
 in order to very comfortable 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.590
 play note on playstation 4 and 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.590
 most likely on x-box one 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.840
 The game gives about 30 frames with a smaller 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.850
 resolution, that is, there is no full hd 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.250
 but they say that the picture is very 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.010
 not bad, I did not play the console version 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.380
 games so nothing really about her 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.370
 I can not say also this serval game 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.989
 on a laptop 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.700
 which is quite good 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.790
 configuration but still significantly 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.590
 weaker than my computer and there the game led 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.660
 yourself quite well with medium 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.750
 settings 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.860
 issued about 30 frames more than 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.480
 enough and looked good and 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.840
 last nights this serval is your 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.930
 old computer on which stands 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.590
 four core am d processor and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:50.550
 gtx 550 ti video card on this system 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.490
 the game gave out but about 30 frames too 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.850
 with medium settings but the fall was 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.690
 more noticeable but the resolution was 1600 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.930
 they are full hd 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.300
 so judge I just can not but 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.040
 In principle, the game is comfortable and in terms of 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.900
 optimizing the game everything is fine you 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.700
 just needed for her 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.680
 more or less average computer like that 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.500
 in the plot details and not go 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.830
 going we all know niki leitmotif 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.690
 the game is what aiden killed his family 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.570
 and he takes revenge only say that 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.870
 the story is interesting enough and I personally 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.720
 still the game is not passed while i'm in 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.810
 process but nonetheless for now what 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.120
 going on me more than delivers by 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.960
 about hacking that is the most important 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.350
 chip 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.170
 total watch dogs and at first you will be 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.960
 available very small amount of some 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.680
 chips but over time you can pump 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.980
 your skills and become a certain king of the city 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.440
 and your 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.780
 how will the management of all its parts 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.780
 hence something must come together 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.240
 a feeling of omnipotence however while i 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.090
 played as much as I lost in short 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.460
 I didn't get that feeling 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.040
 I also want to tell you a little about 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.960
 car physics management 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.110
 cars in my opinion 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.840
 too arcade and looks 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.270
 enough 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.210
 weak and yes and physics in general is not 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.760
 pleased when confronted with others 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.790
 cars you slip and or same 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.580
 banging a tree into feeling that 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:38.260
 nothing happened that's absolutely 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.930
 ok well it's not ok well and on 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.420
 today everything was with you i was him to john 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.580
 watched the channel and justin and it was 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.920
 so small 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.270
 impression of the game watch dogs I hope 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.270
 did you like it bye
