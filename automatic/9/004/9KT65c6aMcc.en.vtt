00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 And then, Gurizada, I 'm fine, I 'm today. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.200
 here to tell you it 's about blush 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.990
 I'll tell you about colors. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.330
 on how to use depending on the hair 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 depending on the skin depending on the format 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.750
 the face 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.330
 so come on reminding me that if 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 perhaps you look for example the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.730
 good for my pink hair 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 but for the color of my skin it gets good 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.310
 reddish for example is not the same 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.710
 color 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 so I suggest you test on yourselves. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 and I think you think it gets better 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.270
 because I do so if I'm in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.399
 Doubt I testo and I see why so nothing 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.280
 How do we even know? 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 the actions it is best that you do not get 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.200
 a more important business and if you like 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.239
 the way it's being used 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 makeup investing and etc. anyway let's go 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.469
 for the tutorial I hope it is useful to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.300
 you and if I forgot some format 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.850
 no hair color any face 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.399
 It's just a question to ask that he's gay. 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.909
 Let's start the tutorial then starting 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.369
 with the colors of the catch 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.900
 if you have pinkish white skin prefer 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.549
 an orange blush and Facebook 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 if you have yellowish white skin 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.100
 pulled to perceive or think then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.830
 I use used to break the yellow 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.409
 if you have black skin use bronze 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 brick color a rock the anc tones 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.600
 darker than anything pink - 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.500
 reddish can but not red 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.450
 open you have brown skin in half 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.150
 term between white and black is then 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.189
 more options can be used from 11 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.990
 we are more open than it was never too 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.840
 soft and now let's go to the colors of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 hair matches each blush 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.299
 if you have blond hair roger 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.790
 any shade of roses 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.710
 if you have black hair, dark blue 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 uses the most playful functionality 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.030
 not to stay all dark 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.460
 if you have reddish red hair and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.850
 light stations use neutral 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.340
 like bronze and beige and nothing red 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.430
 if you have dark hair basically 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.630
 with art gets well as arranged and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.580
 rounds 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.160
 now we go to the pits for each 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.720
 face shape as applied in 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.620
 worries that any brush to 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.540
 show all 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.850
 I will show you in the order glo sushi with 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.170
 the tanning powder and then the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.920
 illuminator 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.200
 if you try the square you should 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 apply the blush horizontally on top of the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.310
 cheek subject is the only one in the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.670
 vertical is also good for tuning the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.290
 do not pass too close to the ship. 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.519
 Okay now the tanning powder I spent the way 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.519
 as they as a promise 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.440
 Now let's go to the facial illuminator of 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.440
 how power has been shown 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.410
 remembering that when I show everyone in this 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.130
 part of the eyebrow I mean that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.830
 underneath the daughter bed and not above 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.750
 so if you have the face watering 4 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.640
 on the kilo already buchecha the blush in 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.220
 toward the top of the cheekbone in a 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.190
 angle of approximately 45 degrees 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.910
 I prefer a darker blush 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:38.140
 now the player gets the taste of this 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:51.250
 I'm only showing shape and the illuminator 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:54.190
 the following beauty now if you 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.350
 has the triangular face and apply the blush 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.750
 in the cheekbones with the movement 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.700
 coming out of the cheek toward the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:08.530
 hair and bronzing powder 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:11.700
 this way you are showing the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.700
 illuminator so now 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:36.499
 and finally you have the oval face 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.379
 the blush as follows 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.419
 so if it is for the night toward 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.229
 what I do to be wider and 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.539
 the day 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.919
 make circular motions in our 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.840
 face 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:57.560

00:04:47.840 --> 00:05:00.969
 I'm showing you now dominate. 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.969
 is throwing in the mouth 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:11.419
 if you have the face with the pre 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.580
 from oval 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.719
 then the illuminator also passes through 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.719
 following parts 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.629
