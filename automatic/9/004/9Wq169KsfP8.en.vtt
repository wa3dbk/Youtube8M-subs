00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 what are you waiting for this match and 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.170
 served belgium beats a lot I think 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.480
 like like all the Belgian people I 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.019
 believe that we have proved 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 last matches we had a team 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 very good very welded very collective 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.779
 with an individual talent that this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.670
 Spain and Germany may have 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.320
 in addition to us so here I am waiting 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.460
 I'm waiting I'm expecting a lot it will be a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 difficult match that everyone knows 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.680
 because in the Balkan countries 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 like that it's never easy to come 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.949
 get three points easily so 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.719
 it is necessary to fight to the end 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 but I think that in the end with the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.290
 qualities that we have in our team is 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.070
 in our core I think it's 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 can be optimistic 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 what can be the key in this match is going 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.250
 the key I think of the party the principle 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.000
 where we are very confident it's us who 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.950
 let's have the ball 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 we must we must play not 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.890
 necessarily go forward all 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.989
 the time either because at this moment 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.690
 then we would leave spaces at the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.730
 Serbian who are still very very good 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.440
 offensive reconversion so here it is 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 you have to manage the match and try 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.539
 to put this little goal that puts us very 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 at ease from the start one of the great 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 quality of the Serbian are the free kick 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.530
 of kolarov and there we say we must do 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.869
 be careful not to make mistakes 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 in dangerous areas but we think 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.810
 still not as a player 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 during the match but as a player 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.110
 we can think about it and especially around 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.430
 of the repair surface because there 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.690
 he has like a left foot 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.610
 very very good as he shows us 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.380
 with with manchester city every week 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.550
 so I believe that defenders to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 approaching the surface will have to 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.370
 be careful if there are small 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.010
 mistakes to commit is better to go 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.080
 commit on the flanks but I have I 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.000
 am optimistic because we have a defense 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.310
 very well organized with two 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.200
 leaders in the company person is 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.180
 normal to the nose and vertonghen and 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.350
 alderweireld are very good 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.760
 professionals so I think there 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 will be no problem at this level a 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.200
 case in six as the past time this will be 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.850
 a good result now and against 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.350
 cancers brands tell me I sign of 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.640
 two hands obviously if we could 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.180
 to do so sure if it would be perfect but 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.710
 four out of six would be a very very good 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 quota also that would make us wii 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.550
 points after after four meetings 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.950
 noah July 15 the Croatians and the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.429
 Serbian so the future would announce itself 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.980
 rather pink and reach the final stage 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.520
 of the world cup yes for 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.050
 players here it's a brief you've lived 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 a few anyway 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.260
 yes what is it like playing with a player 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.270
 a world cup 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.740
 bah I am fortunate to live in the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.450
 first I only played one match and the 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.650
 2nd rank in Italy the second to the states 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.130
 united I was titular at each 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.810
 meet 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.690
 it's the biggest tournament in the world 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.000
 so here we face the best 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.160
 best players from around the world 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.080
 and that's what it does it makes all the progress 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.330
 world means we need it too 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.130
 long time we wait for a big moment 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 at the football level is sure we will 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.910
 qualify for brazil with talent 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.060
 we have in this team there it would be 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 magnificent
