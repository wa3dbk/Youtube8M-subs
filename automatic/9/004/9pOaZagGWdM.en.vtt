00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 hi my name is sergey and as promised 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.540
 I rented a video on the console dandy here in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 such a performance this prefix 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.870
 Chinese-made in the form of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 keyboard 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.520
 I tried to turn it on now but she 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.029
 doesn't start and in this video we 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.849
 We will try to repair and make it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.269
 The first inclusion in the help of me will be here 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.189
 this cartridge 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.829
 9 something there millions shorter than one 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.309
 million and games like there in it well 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 naturally it's all true what's in there 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.379
 one million of these games are games here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 are repeated 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 this cartridge I've already shot, I found 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 its a little bit earlier than this prefix well 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.320
 let's move on to this console 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.949
 I have done about her brief overview here 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 so it looks and now i will take it apart and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.409
 we look at her insides well 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.210
 naturally we will understand what 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:14.729
 the problem and so dismantled in my console 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:21.439
 dendi like this she looks inside it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:29.360
 Here is her keyboard connector for 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:32.360
 cartridges and control board itself 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 joysticks 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.970
 audio video and rf output she has a button 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 inclusions 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.000
 while it does not work the led which 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.000
 shows that it works and here itself 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.009
 shawl now show you back 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 sides and and that's how it looks i look 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:02.909
 in my already climbed into it here where 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.810
 joystick rosin 0 field someone already 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.920
 tried to do it 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.680
 so well and the keyboard luggage itself and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.780
 connects through the connector and now 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.739
 we will understand the reason and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.130
 why it does not start so continue 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.910
 tell you the recovery process 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.030
 this prefix 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:36.050
 and the reason is banal and simple, it is already 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.700
 This console works in principle, nothing 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.880
 did not change here did not drink any 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.140
 radio components and problems were in the tracks 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.730
 that is, there was a turning point on the track and not 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.010
 food came 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.989
 so we could not turn it on 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.290
 someone already tried to do it to you already 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.400
 showed that the joysticks were soldered more precisely 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.870
 Joystick connectors and apparently not 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:12.320
 that's why it's finished now while it's in 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.320
 I will connect it in a disassembled state 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.660
 and make the inclusion of this console I will say 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.630
 Immediately I will not connect the joysticks 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.430
 because while I have with such a wide 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.290
 Connectors no working joystick 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.090
 then the wire is broken then something else 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.090
 the problem is that I don't have time yet 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.760
 do joysticks and recover them 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.239
 under this is just such a wide connector and 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.319
 under this console 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:49.090
 so but now a question for connoisseurs I have already 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.090
 included I already said it and 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.150
 I look here these buttons on the keyboard 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.910
 I need a special cartridge here 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:06.319
 for programming so I understand here 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:09.720
 basic probably or something else is worth but 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.700
 in general, it now works just like 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.709
 simple prefix dendy that is, we 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.139
 put the cartridge it starts you can 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.940
 play the keyboard itself this is it not 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.329
 active there are no commands we 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.460
 we can not enter that is maybe I 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.640
 I do something wrong of course if u 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:32.690
 who was such a prefix can 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:36.660
 share your experiences and tell 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.970
 in more detail how to work with this 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.460
 keyboard and what is it all about here 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.210
 need so now we will connect the power 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.220
 so by the way the keyboard itself 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.060
 here we already had the power button 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.050
 nothing we will find it now so connect 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.830
 the prefix is connected just here we are 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.470
 see three 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.950
 so now a little uncomfortable with one hand 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.680
 shoot all focus 3 connectors yellow 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.830
 white red yellow this video is white 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.930
 audio and red and rate of output that is 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.340
 connection via antenna input 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.200
 TV I will do it through 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.630
 rf 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.260
 because because the TV wandered 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.740
 we don't have old sample 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.470
 audio video output and so we 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.340
 connect through the explosion through the antenna so 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:41.960
 Well, the power supply power supply, too 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:45.480
 I connect here 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.950
 power is connected and now we will do 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.660
 first turn on the LED lit up so 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:06:02.550
 how we did not put the frame now we 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:04.530
 turn off put 5 like this and let's 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.390
 make the first inclusion so you can see 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.830
 that this is this particular cartridge i like this 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.330
 I will try to frame 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:15.410
 take everything here we have the power button 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:19.620
 turn on the LED fired up and we 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.330
 appeared on the menu screen cartridges so well 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.130
 and briefly tell you about the cartridge 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:30.410
 here what games are super mario fifa football 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.750
 olympic this is galaxian duck olympiad 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:36.420
 closet 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.850
 long jumps generally so sporty 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.060
 this cartridge is more here olympiad and 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.710
 everything else but also the famous super 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.360
 Mario 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:51.570
 I can't show you how 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:57.810
 plays this prefix 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:59.880
 but the main thing is that it works works in 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.950
 basically the main part by the joystick i 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.290
 I don't know for sure whether they work or not 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.960
 because I say what I check and 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.170
 I can not now 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:13.920
 here and now I will make a small reklamku 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:17.160
 this next video we finally 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.970
 connect the prefix byte I tell you about it 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:25.980
 already told it will be byte in my 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.760
 1 byte here and I'll show you first 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.130
 turning on 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.740
 and how it works thank you all
