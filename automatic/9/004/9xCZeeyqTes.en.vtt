these<00:04:41.290> guys<00:04:41.470> with<00:04:41.800> Rosalyn<00:04:42.960> making<00:04:43.960> no<00:04:44.080> sense

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
these guys with Rosalyn making no sense

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.279 
these guys with Rosalyn making no sense
no<00:04:45.010> sense<00:04:45.070> off

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.689 

the<00:04:49.289> first<00:04:49.500> level<00:04:49.710> isn't<00:04:49.949> particularly

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
the first level isn't particularly

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.170 
the first level isn't particularly
interesting<00:04:51.389> but<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:53.160> gets<00:04:53.370> some<00:04:53.639> platforming

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
interesting but it gets some platforming

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.490 
interesting but it gets some platforming
elements<00:04:54.270> in<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.720> later<00:04:54.870> levels<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.409> it

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
elements in the later levels and it

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.710 
elements in the later levels and it
becomes<00:04:55.770> far<00:04:56.460> more<00:04:56.490> interesting<00:04:57.120> as<00:04:57.509> soon<00:04:57.659> as

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
becomes far more interesting as soon as

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.210 
becomes far more interesting as soon as
you<00:04:57.810> hit<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.990> second<00:04:58.259> level<00:04:58.409> which<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.889> by<00:04:59.190> the

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
you hit the second level which is by the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.959 
you hit the second level which is by the
way<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.460> worst<00:04:59.849> level

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.969 

yeah<00:05:03.419> these<00:05:03.989> blue<00:05:04.199> guys<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:04.649> of<00:05:04.709> course<00:05:04.889> we

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
yeah these blue guys and of course we

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.829 
yeah these blue guys and of course we
can<00:05:05.129> break<00:05:05.309> ours<00:05:05.549> because<00:05:05.849> this<00:05:06.389> is<00:05:06.569> the<00:05:06.659> size

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:06.839 
can break ours because this is the size

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.809 
can break ours because this is the size
of<00:05:06.989> a<00:05:07.049> nebula<00:05:07.289> why<00:05:07.860> wouldn't<00:05:08.279> we<00:05:08.369> be<00:05:08.399> able<00:05:08.639> to

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
of a nebula why wouldn't we be able to

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.159 
of a nebula why wouldn't we be able to
destroy<00:05:09.059> cars<00:05:09.329> even<00:05:09.569> though<00:05:09.749> we're<00:05:09.899> supposed

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
destroy cars even though we're supposed

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.829 
destroy cars even though we're supposed
