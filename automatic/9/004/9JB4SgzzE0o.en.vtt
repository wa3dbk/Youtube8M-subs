to<00:00:21.750> tell<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.320> specs<00:00:22.770> on<00:00:23.009> the<00:00:23.130> diamonds

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
to tell you the specs on the diamonds

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.600 
to tell you the specs on the diamonds
I'm<00:00:24.090> gonna<00:00:24.270> give<00:00:24.450> you<00:00:24.540> my<00:00:24.750> two<00:00:25.230> cents<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
I'm gonna give you my two cents on the

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.780 
I'm gonna give you my two cents on the
optical<00:00:27.329> properties<00:00:27.770> okay<00:00:28.770> so<00:00:29.250> what's<00:00:29.669> this

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
optical properties okay so what's this

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.080 
optical properties okay so what's this
first<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.509> Sarah<00:00:31.020> first<00:00:31.290> one<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:32.090> 1.78

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
first time in Sarah first one is 1.78

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.410 
first time in Sarah first one is 1.78
vs1<00:00:33.960> okay<00:00:34.890> sweet<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.610> what's<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> second<00:00:36.300> one

vs1 okay sweet and what's the second one

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.690 
vs1 okay sweet and what's the second one
a<00:00:37.280> 151<00:00:38.480> EVs<00:00:39.480> -<00:00:39.840> okay<00:00:40.440> alright<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.310> these

a 151 EVs - okay alright now on these

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
a 151 EVs - okay alright now on these
two<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> optics<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.320> both<00:00:43.650> of<00:00:43.860> them

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
two the optics I like on both of them

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.980 
two the optics I like on both of them
really<00:00:44.310> nice<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.940> facets<00:00:45.540> are<00:00:45.720> lightened

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
really nice all the facets are lightened

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.500 
really nice all the facets are lightened
up<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.530> nice<00:00:46.740> if<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.790> was<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> delve

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
up really nice if I was going to delve

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.240 
up really nice if I was going to delve
into<00:00:48.720> further<00:00:49.170> optical<00:00:49.860> examination<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
into further optical examination I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
into further optical examination I
really<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> first<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.060> I<00:00:54.090> hope<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really like the first one I hope you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
really like the first one I hope you
know<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.470> corners<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.220> second<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
know the corners on the second one or it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
know the corners on the second one or it
may<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.239> tad<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:57.989> tapered<00:00:59.810> but<00:01:00.810> they're

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
may be a tad more tapered but they're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
may be a tad more tapered but they're
both<00:01:01.140> jamming<00:01:02.010> they're<00:01:02.250> both<00:01:02.430> looking<00:01:02.670> real

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
both jamming they're both looking real

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
both jamming they're both looking real
good<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.810> these<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.199> two<00:01:04.379> emerald<00:01:04.829> cuts<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
good so these are two emerald cuts that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.300 
good so these are two emerald cuts that
I<00:01:05.339> would<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.259> like<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.380> optics<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.040> see

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I would I like the optics of what I see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.800 
I would I like the optics of what I see
so<00:01:08.490> far<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.850> gonna<00:01:08.939> look<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.270> fire<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so far we're gonna look at fire and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.160 
so far we're gonna look at fire and
sparkle<00:01:10.380> next<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.189> well<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.610> compare<00:01:11.999> that

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
sparkle next as well and compare that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.969 
sparkle next as well and compare that
but<00:01:13.759> so<00:01:14.759> so<00:01:14.969> far<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.590> when<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.679> get<00:01:16.829> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
but so so far so good when we get to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
but so so far so good when we get to
diamonds<00:01:17.399> number<00:01:17.579> three<00:01:17.969> and<00:01:18.149> four<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.899> do

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
diamonds number three and four what do

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.809 
diamonds number three and four what do
we<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.289> here<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.829> these<00:01:19.979> two<00:01:21.259> 1.50<00:01:22.429> fvs<00:01:23.429> one

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
we have here and these two 1.50 fvs one

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.889 
we have here and these two 1.50 fvs one
okay<00:01:24.569> and<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.459> 1.40<00:01:26.459> EVS<00:01:27.270> ooh

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
okay and a 1.40 EVS ooh

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.870 
okay and a 1.40 EVS ooh
okay<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.889> in<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.429> two<00:01:29.700> particular

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
okay now in these two particular

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.059 
okay now in these two particular
diamonds<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.139> notice<00:01:31.409> how<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.590> could<00:01:31.859> see

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
diamonds you notice how you could see

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.660 
diamonds you notice how you could see
whitish<00:01:32.700> area<00:01:33.109> or<00:01:34.109> grayish<00:01:34.530> area<00:01:34.979> under<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
whitish area or grayish area under the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.269 
whitish area or grayish area under the
table<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> center<00:01:36.740> okay<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:38.159> bit

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:38.279 
table in the center okay a little bit

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.399 
table in the center okay a little bit
less<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.939> diamond<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.479> Left<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
less in the diamond on the Left than in

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
less in the diamond on the Left than in
the<00:01:40.499> diamond<00:01:40.889> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.279> that<00:01:41.939> grayish

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the diamond on the right that grayish

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.419 
the diamond on the right that grayish
area<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.289> see<00:01:43.319> those<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.829> facets<00:01:44.310> that

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
area that we see those are facets that

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.639 
area that we see those are facets that
we<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.909> through<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.270> diamondden<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
we could see through the diamondden so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.699 
we could see through the diamondden so
those<00:01:46.889> are<00:01:47.299> leaking<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.659> those<00:01:48.840> areas<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.439> I

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
those are leaking in those areas so I

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.669 
those are leaking in those areas so I
don't<00:01:50.340> prefer<00:01:50.849> these<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.380> four

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
don't prefer these two out of the four

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.120 
don't prefer these two out of the four
that<00:01:53.009> we've<00:01:53.549> looked<00:01:53.849> at<00:01:53.999> so<00:01:54.270> far<00:01:54.590> okay<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.889> my

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that we've looked at so far okay so my

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.730 
that we've looked at so far okay so my
choice<00:01:56.819> my<00:01:57.240> personal<00:01:57.840> recommendation<00:01:58.619> would

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
choice my personal recommendation would

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
choice my personal recommendation would
be<00:01:58.799> first<00:01:59.219> look<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.459> the<00:01:59.579> light<00:01:59.789> how<00:01:59.969> nice<00:02:00.179> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
be first look at the light how nice and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.330 
be first look at the light how nice and
evenly<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.049> bounces<00:02:01.499> off<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.829> those<00:02:01.950> familiy

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
evenly it bounces off of those familiy

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.599 
evenly it bounces off of those familiy
and<00:02:02.520> facets<00:02:02.999> there<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.099> be<00:02:05.249> my<00:02:05.399> first

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
and facets there that would be my first

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.249 
and facets there that would be my first
two<00:02:05.819> choices<00:02:06.119> these<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.599> two<00:02:06.779> gorgeous

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
two choices these are two gorgeous

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.690 
two choices these are two gorgeous
emerald<00:02:07.439> cuts<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.160> we're<00:02:08.310> gonna<00:02:08.399> look<00:02:08.580> at

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
emerald cuts but we're gonna look at

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.020 
emerald cuts but we're gonna look at
fire<00:02:08.940> next<00:02:09.450> two<00:02:09.569> before<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:09.990> make<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> final

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
okay so let's move into spotlighting now

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.069 
okay so let's move into spotlighting now
all<00:03:08.099> right<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.610> once<00:03:08.790> again<00:03:09.090> who<00:03:09.299> is<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.720> mean

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
here is the first two diamonds again in

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.039 
here is the first two diamonds again in
spotlighting<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.450> with<00:03:15.450> emerald<00:03:15.810> cuts

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
spotlighting and with emerald cuts

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.160 
spotlighting and with emerald cuts
because<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:16.769> are<00:03:17.010> long<00:03:17.519> step<00:03:18.209> cut<00:03:18.510> facets

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170

you know it's almost like all of them
light<00:03:21.329> up<00:03:21.540> at<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> same<00:03:22.049> time<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.709> you'll<00:03:22.950> see

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
light up at the same time so you'll see

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.940 
light up at the same time so you'll see
as<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.459> rock<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.000> tilt<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.389> tray<00:03:24.739> you'll<00:03:25.739> see

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
as I rock and tilt the tray you'll see

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.520 
as I rock and tilt the tray you'll see
smaller<00:03:26.870> sparkles<00:03:27.870> happen<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.380> this

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
smaller sparkles happen in this

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.500 
smaller sparkles happen in this
direction<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:29.459> as<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.670> swing<00:03:30.299> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
direction and then as I swing the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.599 
direction and then as I swing the
diamonds<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.650> fall<00:03:31.920> underneath<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
diamonds to fall underneath the

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.420 
diamonds to fall underneath the
spotlighting<00:03:33.329> right<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.840> are<00:03:34.430> your

spotlighting right there are your
internal<00:03:35.970> reflections<00:03:36.920> happening<00:03:37.920> within

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
internal reflections happening within

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.509 
internal reflections happening within
these<00:03:38.370> emerald<00:03:38.760> cuts<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:40.250> kind<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.310> favor

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
these emerald cuts and I kind of favor

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.099 
these emerald cuts and I kind of favor
the<00:03:41.730> one<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> left<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.510> little<00:03:42.600> bit<00:03:42.750> more

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
the one on the left a little bit more

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.559 
the one on the left a little bit more
than<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.319> right<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.620> these<00:03:43.799> are<00:03:43.980> two

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
than the right but these are two

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.150 
than the right but these are two
good-looking<00:03:45.569> stones<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.769> not<00:03:46.920> an

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
good-looking stones so it's not an

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.250 
good-looking stones so it's not an
earth-shattering<00:03:47.639> difference<00:03:48.329> there<00:03:48.540> let's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
earth-shattering difference there let's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.970 
earth-shattering difference there let's

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
I'm not seeing the strong reflections in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.080 
I'm not seeing the strong reflections in
that<00:03:57.209> one<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.750> was<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.139> other<00:03:58.290> ones<00:03:58.590> and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
that one like I was the other ones and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.789 
that one like I was the other ones and
look<00:04:00.090> at<00:04:00.269> how<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.959> diamond<00:04:01.319> on<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.470> right

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
look at how on the diamond on the right

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.250 
look at how on the diamond on the right
you<00:04:02.340> could<00:04:02.519> see<00:04:02.819> through<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> table<00:04:03.750> facet

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
you could see through the table facet

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.620 
you could see through the table facet
back<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.739> gray<00:04:05.099> behind<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.730> diamond<00:04:06.120> so

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
back to the gray behind the diamond so

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.270 
back to the gray behind the diamond so
again<00:04:06.959> there<00:04:07.200> those<00:04:07.410> are<00:04:07.560> non<00:04:07.799> reflective

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
again there those are non reflective

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.309 
again there those are non reflective
surfaces<00:04:09.180> on<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.480> bottom<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.959> emerald
