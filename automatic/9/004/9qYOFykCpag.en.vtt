alright<00:01:57.960> last<00:01:58.170> time<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.759> not

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
alright last time if not we are not

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.100 
alright last time if not we are not
going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.829> all<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.040> all<00:02:02.430> right<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.450> just

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
going to all right so all right so just

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
going to all right so all right so just
one<00:02:04.320> point<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.040> actually<00:02:05.490> possible<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
one point it's not actually possible to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.580 
one point it's not actually possible to
get<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.780> x<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.860> better<00:02:08.849> stay<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.119> camera<00:02:09.629> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
get more x or better stay on camera so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.920 
get more x or better stay on camera so
this<00:02:10.890> was<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.400> easter<00:02:11.819> egg<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.660> all

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
this was the easter egg so we have all

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.380 
this was the easter egg so we have all
those<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.590> most<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.670> futures<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.239> not

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
those and most of the futures do not

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.690 
those and most of the futures do not
work<00:02:15.599> first<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.489> says

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
work first of all as you can see it says

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 
work first of all as you can see it says
unfortunately<00:02:18.000> settings<00:02:18.989> desktop<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.620> many

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
unfortunately settings desktop so many

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.900 
unfortunately settings desktop so many
applications<00:02:20.959> first<00:02:21.959> close<00:02:22.290> often<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.819> have

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
applications first close often we have

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.460 
applications first close often we have
camera<00:02:24.270> here<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.959> course<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.349> doesn't

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
camera here and of course it doesn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.790 
camera here and of course it doesn't
open<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.819> haven't<00:02:27.510> tested<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.080> Wi-Fi

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
open I haven't tested the Wi-Fi

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.750 
open I haven't tested the Wi-Fi
capabilities<00:02:29.610> yet<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.440> with<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.190> let's<00:02:32.580> go

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
capabilities yet so with that let's go

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.809 
capabilities yet so with that let's go
to<00:02:32.819> Wi-Fi<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.569> let's<00:02:34.019> turn<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
to Wi-Fi and let's turn it on so it this

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.180 
to Wi-Fi and let's turn it on so it this
toggle<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.480> gets<00:02:39.900> turned<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.349> but<00:02:40.590> doesn't

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
toggle here gets turned on but doesn't

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.619 
toggle here gets turned on but doesn't
show<00:02:41.790> any<00:02:42.830> available<00:02:43.830> Wi-Fi<00:02:44.129> network<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
show any available Wi-Fi network so this

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.660 
show any available Wi-Fi network so this
means<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.959> doesn't<00:02:46.379> work<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.250> same<00:02:47.459> thing

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
means this doesn't work the same thing

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
means this doesn't work the same thing
goes<00:02:47.849> with<00:02:48.000> Bluetooth<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.750> don't<00:02:49.530> use<00:02:49.620> no

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
goes with Bluetooth that I don't use no

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.199 
goes with Bluetooth that I don't use no
so<00:02:50.849> let's<00:02:51.090> go<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.300> display<00:02:52.160> we<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:53.459> those

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
so let's go to display we have all those

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.259 
so let's go to display we have all those
option<00:02:54.629> over<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.640> old<00:02:56.640> papers

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
option over here old papers

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.390 
option over here old papers
actual<00:02:57.690> window<00:02:58.530> let's<00:02:59.489> go<00:02:59.700> back<00:03:01.310> we<00:03:02.310> have

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
actual window let's go back we have

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.490 
actual window let's go back we have

hey guys most of future do not work

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.550 
hey guys most of future do not work
again<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.099> Easter<00:03:14.550> Egg<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.560> if

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
again here it is the Easter Egg and if

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.009 
again here it is the Easter Egg and if
we<00:03:16.830> actually<00:03:16.980> go<00:03:17.730> back<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.209> some<00:03:18.569> future<00:03:18.840> such

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
we actually go back and some future such

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.869 
we actually go back and some future such
evil<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> home<00:03:19.890> button<00:03:20.220> doesn't<00:03:20.370> work<00:03:20.519> so

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
evil the home button doesn't work so

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.869 
evil the home button doesn't work so
browse<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.390> browser<00:03:21.629> doesn't<00:03:21.959> work<00:03:22.290> phone<00:03:23.129> or

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
browse the browser doesn't work phone or

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.240 
browse the browser doesn't work phone or
iPhone<00:03:24.360> works<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.260> does<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.860> actually<00:03:25.890> make

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
iPhone works but does it actually make

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.270 
iPhone works but does it actually make
phone<00:03:26.519> calls<00:03:26.790> or<00:03:28.040> let's<00:03:29.040> type<00:03:29.250> random<00:03:29.730> number

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.360 

so<00:03:35.120> yeah<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.630> looks<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.020> from<00:03:36.590> homework<00:03:37.130> but

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
so yeah it looks like from homework but

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.150 
so yeah it looks like from homework but
I'm<00:03:37.580> not<00:03:37.850> too<00:03:38.000> sure<00:03:38.180> about<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.830> home<00:03:39.980> bar

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
I'm not too sure about that the home bar

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.380 
I'm not too sure about that the home bar
doesn't<00:03:40.550> work<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.000> though<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:44.360> a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
doesn't work so though we have a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.390 
doesn't work so though we have a
neighbor<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.530> home<00:03:45.710> but<00:03:45.860> isn't<00:03:46.190> work

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
neighbor that so the home but isn't work

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.100 
neighbor that so the home but isn't work
so<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.640> have<00:03:46.790> actually<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.360> press<00:03:47.570> this<00:03:47.750> Becky

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
so you have actually to press this Becky

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.080 
so you have actually to press this Becky
in<00:03:48.470> order<00:03:48.710> to<00:03:48.830> go<00:03:48.980> back<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:49.760> pass<00:03:49.910> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
in order to go back so if you pass the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.400 
in order to go back so if you pass the
home<00:03:50.240> phone<00:03:50.420> doesn't<00:03:50.450> work<00:03:51.790> now<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.850> need<00:03:53.120> to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
home phone doesn't work now we need to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.830 
home phone doesn't work now we need to
Becky<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.830> same<00:03:54.980> thing<00:03:55.190> with<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.910> let's

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
Becky the same thing with all that let's

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.600 
Becky the same thing with all that let's
see<00:03:56.990> about<00:03:57.080> we<00:03:57.770> just<00:03:57.800> what<00:03:58.190> kind<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.459> we<00:03:58.580> just

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
see about we just what kind of we just

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.190 
see about we just what kind of we just
do<00:03:58.850> they<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.090> here<00:03:59.300> actually<00:03:59.510> we<00:03:59.900> don't<00:04:00.020> have

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
do they have here actually we don't have

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.360 
do they have here actually we don't have
any<00:04:00.730> yeah<00:04:01.959> actually<00:04:02.959> there<00:04:03.709> should<00:04:03.950> be<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.220> all

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
any yeah actually there should be it all

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.120 
any yeah actually there should be it all
right<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.600> huge<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.140> can<00:04:06.290> use<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:06.830> most<00:04:07.040> of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
right so huge it you can use but most of

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.160 
right so huge it you can use but most of
applications<00:04:07.730> aren't<00:04:08.000> very<00:04:08.360> usable<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.020> they

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
applications aren't very usable and they

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.920 
applications aren't very usable and they
will<00:04:09.410> first<00:04:09.770> close<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.489> lot<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.060> say<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.810> was

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
will first close a lot so say that was

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.650 
will first close a lot so say that was
just<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.380> quick<00:04:12.770> look<00:04:13.250> at<00:04:13.520> a<00:04:13.760> better<00:04:14.060> build<00:04:14.450> off
