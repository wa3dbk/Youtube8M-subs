Orchard this year before the trees lose
their<00:00:10.019> leaves<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:11.090> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> dwarf<00:00:12.719> Honey

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259

a<00:00:18.869> pretty<00:00:19.050> small<00:00:19.170> tree<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.160> sound<00:00:20.400> or

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730

a pretty small tree but it sound or
f---ing<00:00:20.939> rootstock<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.199> guess<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
f---ing rootstock so I guess that's to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
f---ing rootstock so I guess that's to
be<00:00:25.369> considered<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> small<00:00:27.750> tree<00:00:28.140> here

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
more leaves on it than any other tree so

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.020 
more leaves on it than any other tree so
it<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> hardy<00:03:30.980> tree<00:03:31.250> because<00:03:31.610> we've<00:03:31.790> had<00:03:31.970> a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
it is a hardy tree because we've had a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.620 
it is a hardy tree because we've had a
couple<00:03:32.270> Frost's<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:35.060> seems<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.510> be

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
couple Frost's here but it seems to be

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.430 
couple Frost's here but it seems to be
doing<00:03:35.959> well

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
doing well

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.210 
doing well
so<00:03:38.080> maybe<00:03:39.080> next<00:03:39.440> year<00:03:39.680> we'll<00:03:39.860> get<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> couple

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
so maybe next year we'll get a couple

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.180 
so maybe next year we'll get a couple
