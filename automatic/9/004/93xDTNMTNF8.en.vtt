killstreak<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:27.180> five<00:02:28.180> seconds<00:02:28.570> into

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
killstreak and then five seconds into

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960 
killstreak and then five seconds into
the<00:02:28.990> killstreak<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.740> gets<00:02:30.100> taken<00:02:30.400> out<00:02:30.670> and

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the killstreak it gets taken out and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.700 
the killstreak it gets taken out and
you're<00:02:31.210> like<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.810> pissed<00:02:32.140> because<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.530> work

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
you're like so pissed because you work

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.050 
you're like so pissed because you work
so<00:02:32.740> hard<00:02:33.570> now<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:35.080> think<00:02:36.010> people<00:02:36.400> should<00:02:36.580> use<00:02:37.030> it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
so hard now I think people should use it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.230 
so hard now I think people should use it
like<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:38.440> for<00:02:38.680> staying<00:02:39.010> off<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.220> radar<00:02:39.520> not

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
like just for staying off the radar not

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.320 
like just for staying off the radar not
for<00:02:40.959> camping<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.100> stuff<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.120> have

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
for camping and stuff like that I have

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.910 
for camping and stuff like that I have
nothing<00:02:43.480> against<00:02:43.990> camping<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:44.709> think

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
nothing against camping I just think

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.460 
nothing against camping I just think
it's<00:02:45.220> noobish<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:48.640> track<00:02:49.570> fix<00:02:50.050> ghosts

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
it's noobish and they track fix ghosts

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.580 
it's noobish and they track fix ghosts
by<00:02:50.860> removing<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.790> ghillie<00:02:52.120> suit<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:53.320> in

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
by removing the ghillie suit like in

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.530 
by removing the ghillie suit like in
modern<00:02:54.280> warfare<00:02:54.400> 2<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.120> had<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.270> ghillie

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
modern warfare 2 if you had a ghillie

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.140 
modern warfare 2 if you had a ghillie
suit<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.230> were<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.410> sniper<00:02:56.550> now<00:02:57.550> when<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:57.910> first

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
suit you were a sniper now when I first

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.800 
suit you were a sniper now when I first
got<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.810> game<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.670> saw<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> guy<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810

got the game I and I saw a guy with the
ghillie<00:03:02.020> suit<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.620> was<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.520> ran<00:03:03.730> up<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:03.910> him<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.209> I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
ghillie suit I was I ran up to him so I

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.800 
ghillie suit I was I ran up to him so I
can<00:03:04.420> knife<00:03:04.600> him<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:07.120> was<00:03:07.180> actually<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
can knife him but that it was actually a

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.170 
can knife him but that it was actually a
guy<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.530> had<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.769> submachine<00:03:09.370> gun<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:09.970> like

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
guy that had a submachine gun it's like

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.780 
guy that had a submachine gun it's like
what<00:03:10.480> I'm<00:03:10.570> saying<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.380> ghost<00:03:12.370> person

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
what I'm saying is that ghost person

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.600 
what I'm saying is that ghost person
shouldn't<00:03:13.330> have<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> ghillie<00:03:13.900> suit<00:03:14.200> unless

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
shouldn't have a ghillie suit unless

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.470 
shouldn't have a ghillie suit unless
they're<00:03:15.610> sniping<00:03:17.070> they<00:03:18.070> could<00:03:18.310> take<00:03:18.610> if<00:03:18.910> they

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
they're sniping they could take if they

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.060 
they're sniping they could take if they
take<00:03:19.660> out<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.989> ghillie<00:03:20.170> suit<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.620> think<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:21.040> lot

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
take out the ghillie suit I think a lot

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.460 
take out the ghillie suit I think a lot
of<00:03:21.310> people<00:03:21.459> would<00:03:21.820> be<00:03:21.970> happy<00:03:22.000> because<00:03:22.540> that's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
of people would be happy because that's

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.910 
of people would be happy because that's
one<00:03:23.920> thing<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.600> pisses<00:03:25.600> people<00:03:25.930> off<00:03:26.230> with<00:03:26.709> a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
one thing that pisses people off with a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.630 
one thing that pisses people off with a
lot<00:03:28.140> now<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.200> second<00:03:29.860> way<00:03:29.920> they<00:03:30.100> can<00:03:30.220> fix<00:03:30.430> it

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
lot now the second way they can fix it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.479 
lot now the second way they can fix it
is<00:03:30.790> by<00:03:31.709> like<00:03:32.910> requiring<00:03:33.910> an<00:03:34.739> extra<00:03:35.739> hit<00:03:36.220> with

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
is by like requiring an extra hit with

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.130 
is by like requiring an extra hit with
the<00:03:36.610> missile<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.390> take<00:03:37.420> down<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> killstreak

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
the missile to take down a killstreak

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.229 
the missile to take down a killstreak
like<00:03:38.860> for<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> chopper<00:03:40.300> gunner<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.720> takes<00:03:40.989> two

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
like for a chopper gunner it takes two

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.940 
like for a chopper gunner it takes two
so<00:03:43.239> like<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.810> get<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.320> get<00:03:44.500> two<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.800> the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so like you get you get two of the

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.380 
so like you get you get two of the
missiles<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.610> then<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.140> die<00:03:47.380> or<00:03:48.390> get

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
missiles and then you have to die or get

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.710 
missiles and then you have to die or get
another<00:03:49.630> missile<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.230> take<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.400> out<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:52.660> that

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
another missile to take it out now that

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.949 
another missile to take it out now that
could<00:03:52.840> also<00:03:53.049> make<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.500> harder<00:03:53.890> by<00:03:54.360> not<00:03:55.360> having

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
could also make it harder by not having

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.690 
could also make it harder by not having
the<00:03:56.530> straw<00:03:56.860> launcher<00:03:57.430> connect<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
the straw launcher connect to the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.509 
the straw launcher connect to the
aircraft<00:04:00.700> as<00:04:00.989> easily<00:04:01.989> because<00:04:02.530> all<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:03.340> gotta

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
aircraft as easily because all you gotta

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.140 
aircraft as easily because all you gotta
do<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:04.140> just<00:04:05.250> take<00:04:06.250> out<00:04:06.430> your<00:04:06.519> stroller<00:04:06.820> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
do is just take out your stroller and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.410 
do is just take out your stroller and
aim<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.810> at<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.709> aircraft<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:10.120> basically

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
aim it at the aircraft and it basically

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.810 
aim it at the aircraft and it basically
locks<00:04:10.989> on<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.350> its<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.190> aircraft<00:04:12.549> by

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
locks on to its to the aircraft by

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.640 
locks on to its to the aircraft by
itself<00:04:13.180> they<00:04:13.630> should<00:04:13.810> make<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.019> like<00:04:14.350> how<00:04:14.590> it

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
itself they should make it like how it

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.720 
itself they should make it like how it
wasn't<00:04:15.160> caught

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
wasn't caught

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.810 
wasn't caught
or<00:04:15.849> where<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.900> use<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.229> RPG<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.519> wouldn't

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
or where you use the RPG and it wouldn't

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.270 
or where you use the RPG and it wouldn't
lock<00:04:19.030> on<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.810> just<00:04:20.500> have<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.769> see<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.010> you

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
lock on a you just have to see if you

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.100 
lock on a you just have to see if you
get<00:04:21.459> lucky<00:04:21.669> or<00:04:22.030> if<00:04:22.419> you're<00:04:22.570> really<00:04:22.750> good<00:04:23.080> at

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
get lucky or if you're really good at

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.879 
get lucky or if you're really good at
aiming<00:04:23.440> if<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:24.669> get<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:24.970> or<00:04:25.090> not<00:04:25.240> now<00:04:26.229> if<00:04:26.560> they

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
aiming if you get it or not now if they

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.129 
aiming if you get it or not now if they
would<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.669> think<00:04:28.030> people<00:04:28.690> would<00:04:28.960> have

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
would do that I think people would have

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.070 
would do that I think people would have

should have like some way to counter
last<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.979> like<00:05:24.729> I<00:05:25.090> don't<00:05:25.240> know<00:05:25.479> but<00:05:26.760> they

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
should like have it harder to get the

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.550 
should like have it harder to get the
pro<00:05:30.400> perk<00:05:30.729> cuz<00:05:31.419> like<00:05:31.570> right<00:05:31.870> now<00:05:32.050> it's<00:05:32.320> really

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
pro perk cuz like right now it's really

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.170 
pro perk cuz like right now it's really
easy<00:05:32.950> all<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.250> got<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.520> do<00:05:33.610> is<00:05:33.729> get<00:05:33.849> a<00:05:33.910> headshot

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
easy all you got to do is get a headshot

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.770 
easy all you got to do is get a headshot
and<00:05:34.599> get<00:05:35.169> like<00:05:35.320> 10<00:05:35.680> kills<00:05:36.010> in<00:05:36.580> last<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:37.510> like

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
and get like 10 kills in last and like

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.570 
and get like 10 kills in last and like
that's<00:05:38.050> so<00:05:38.440> easy<00:05:38.770> i<00:05:39.010> think<00:05:39.099> that's<00:05:39.460> the

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
that's so easy i think that's the

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.800 
that's so easy i think that's the
easiest<00:05:39.910> part<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.510> get<00:05:40.690> pro<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:43.180> other<00:05:43.419> thing

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
easiest part to get pro the other thing

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.400 
easiest part to get pro the other thing
is<00:05:44.130> like<00:05:45.130> sometimes<00:05:45.729> when<00:05:46.510> they<00:05:46.780> go<00:05:46.990> into<00:05:47.169> last

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
is like sometimes when they go into last

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.409 
is like sometimes when they go into last
and<00:05:47.680> they<00:05:47.979> can<00:05:48.190> knife<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.700> well<00:05:49.030> they're<00:05:49.389> in

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
and they can knife you well they're in

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.210 
and they can knife you well they're in
last<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.139> i<00:05:50.380> think<00:05:50.620> they<00:05:50.740> should<00:05:50.919> take<00:05:51.099> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
last and i think they should take the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.760 
last and i think they should take the
knifing<00:05:51.580> auction<00:05:52.000> off<00:05:52.240> while<00:05:52.900> in<00:05:53.200> last<00:05:53.470> stand

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
knifing auction off while in last stand

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.279 
knifing auction off while in last stand
and<00:05:54.550> i<00:05:55.270> think<00:05:55.330> that<00:05:55.810> would<00:05:55.870> make<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.050> lot<00:05:56.229> of

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
and i think that would make a lot of

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.779 
and i think that would make a lot of
people<00:05:56.470> happy<00:05:56.889> because<00:05:57.130> that's<00:05:57.370> how<00:05:57.520> a<00:05:57.550> lot<00:05:57.729> of

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
people happy because that's how a lot of

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.540 
people happy because that's how a lot of
people<00:05:57.880> die<00:05:58.270> sometimes<00:05:58.750> now<00:05:59.740> my<00:05:59.889> commentary
