00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.800 
like that a trick for that is just get
your<00:03:39.300> glue<00:03:39.600> gun<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:41.040> find<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.730> end<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.330> go

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
your glue gun and find the end and go

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.980 
your glue gun and find the end and go
ahead<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.900> put<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> nice<00:03:46.320> generous<00:03:48.410> dollop<00:03:49.410> of

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.640 
glue on it and that will keep it I'm
completely<00:03:55.710> falling<00:03:56.480> apart<00:03:58.850> there<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.000> go

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
completely falling apart there you go

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.850 
completely falling apart there you go
okay

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
okay

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.660 
okay
yeah<00:04:02.280> that's<00:04:02.490> not<00:04:02.640> gonna<00:04:04.460> it's<00:04:05.460> not<00:04:05.550> gonna

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
yeah that's not gonna it's not gonna
