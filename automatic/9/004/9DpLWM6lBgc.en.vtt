nice<00:02:10.920> pop<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> fact<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
nice pop to it because of the fact that

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.410 
nice pop to it because of the fact that
it<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.380> got<00:02:13.590> different<00:02:14.069> tones<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.730> being

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
that is black on black when they do

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.820 
that is black on black when they do
stuff<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.390> always<00:02:18.660> pops<00:02:19.170> nice<00:02:19.500> you

different<00:02:22.500> textures<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.340> because<00:02:23.519> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
different textures on it because it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
different textures on it because it
gives<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.030> life<00:02:24.299> even<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.019> black<00:02:25.260> on

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
this kind of look this would have been

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.910 
this kind of look this would have been

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
did now that I'm looking at the screen

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.950 
did now that I'm looking at the screen
while<00:06:05.740> I'm<00:06:05.949> filming<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:06.550> wish<00:06:06.910> they<00:06:07.120> kept<00:06:07.750> the

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
while I'm filming I wish they kept the

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.040 
while I'm filming I wish they kept the
bottom<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.979> actual<00:06:09.370> outsole<00:06:09.970> they<00:06:10.660> kept<00:06:10.900> it

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
bottom the actual outsole they kept it

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.140 
bottom the actual outsole they kept it
all<00:06:11.259> black<00:06:11.650> I<00:06:12.130> think<00:06:12.759> that<00:06:12.880> would<00:06:13.000> have<00:06:13.120> been

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
all black I think that would have been

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.850 
all black I think that would have been
better<00:06:13.389> if<00:06:13.630> it<00:06:13.750> was<00:06:13.870> just<00:06:14.050> straight-up<00:06:14.440> just

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
better if it was just straight-up just

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.730 
better if it was just straight-up just
one<00:06:15.160> solid<00:06:15.460> color<00:06:15.849> that<00:06:16.000> outsole<00:06:16.740> that's

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
one solid color that outsole that's

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.409 
one solid color that outsole that's
probably<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.400> biggest<00:06:18.699> thing<00:06:19.060> that<00:06:19.120> I'm

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
probably the biggest thing that I'm

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.990 
probably the biggest thing that I'm
seeing<00:06:19.780> right<00:06:20.050> now<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.380> I'm<00:06:20.560> watching<00:06:21.000> looking

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
seeing right now is I'm watching looking

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.860 
seeing right now is I'm watching looking
at<00:06:22.389> the<00:06:23.250> actual<00:06:24.250> screen<00:06:24.729> from<00:06:25.090> my<00:06:25.240> camera<00:06:25.539> I

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
at the actual screen from my camera I

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.270 
at the actual screen from my camera I
think<00:06:26.020> that<00:06:26.349> this<00:06:26.500> should<00:06:26.650> have<00:06:26.740> kept<00:06:26.949> in<00:06:27.070> one

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
think that this should have kept in one

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.730 
think that this should have kept in one
color<00:06:27.639> would<00:06:27.940> have<00:06:28.060> been<00:06:28.180> way<00:06:28.360> hotter<00:06:28.660> but<00:06:29.590> it

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
color would have been way hotter but it

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.760 
color would have been way hotter but it
still<00:06:30.009> looks<00:06:30.190> great<00:06:30.310> off<00:06:30.580> feet<00:06:30.820> of<00:06:30.940> my<00:06:31.060> opinion

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
still looks great off feet of my opinion

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.020 
still looks great off feet of my opinion
