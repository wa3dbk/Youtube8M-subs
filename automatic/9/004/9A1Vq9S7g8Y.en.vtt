00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.960 

so<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.050> pinwheel<00:00:01.410> magic<00:00:01.770> comes<00:00:02.010> in<00:00:02.190> two<00:00:02.370> sizes

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so the pinwheel magic comes in two sizes

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.579 
so the pinwheel magic comes in two sizes
you've<00:00:03.300> got<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.570> four<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> half<00:00:04.020> inch<00:00:04.410> and

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
you've got the four and a half inch and

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.130 
you've got the four and a half inch and
the<00:00:05.160> six<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.640> half<00:00:05.670> inch<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.450> each

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the six and a half inch and each

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.230 
the six and a half inch and each
template<00:00:07.680> can<00:00:07.950> be<00:00:07.980> made<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.670> use<00:00:08.849> three

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
template can be made to use three

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.259 
template can be made to use three
different<00:00:09.450> types<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.490> pinwheels<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.090> there's

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
different types of pinwheels so there's

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.640 
different types of pinwheels so there's
lines<00:00:12.509> marked<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> ruler

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
lines marked on the ruler

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.760 
lines marked on the ruler
we've<00:00:13.769> got<00:00:13.920> line<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.370> line<00:00:14.759> B<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.059> line<00:00:15.389> C<00:00:15.900> line

these<00:00:33.329> templates<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.469> they've<00:00:34.680> got

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
these templates are that they've got

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
these templates are that they've got
some<00:00:35.160> holes<00:00:35.460> cut<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.510> that

so following the instructions on the
back<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> pack<00:00:50.129> yeah<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> little

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
back of the pack yeah I had a little

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
back of the pack yeah I had a little
play<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.660> these<00:00:51.989> templates<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.250> I've

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
play with these templates and what I've

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.170 
play with these templates and what I've
done<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.879> I've<00:00:54.719> cut<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:55.469> squares<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.489> six<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
done is I've cut some squares so six and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
done is I've cut some squares so six and
three-quarter<00:00:57.629> inch<00:00:57.750> squares<00:00:58.079> I've<00:00:58.680> joined

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
three-quarter inch squares I've joined

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
three-quarter inch squares I've joined
them<00:00:59.129> together<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.210> three<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> half

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
them together and a three and a half

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.709 
them together and a three and a half
inch<00:01:00.960> border<00:01:01.379> around<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.039> edge<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> basically

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
inch border around the edge so basically

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
inch border around the edge so basically
you<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.710> template<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.460> I'm<00:01:05.880> going

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you put your template on and I'm going

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.330 
you put your template on and I'm going
to<00:01:06.270> use<00:01:06.450> line<00:01:06.780> B<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.680> simply<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.040> matter<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to use line B so it's simply a matter of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
to use line B so it's simply a matter of
lining<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.090> line<00:01:09.360> B<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> seeds<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
lining up line B with the seeds and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.420 
lining up line B with the seeds and
cutting<00:01:11.970> around<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> edge<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> I've<00:01:14.189> got<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
cutting around the edge so I've got the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
cutting around the edge so I've got the
clear<00:01:14.670> grip<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> bottom<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:16.080> prevent<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
clear grip on the bottom to prevent the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
clear grip on the bottom to prevent the
template<00:01:16.890> from<00:01:17.040> slipping<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:18.659> just

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
template from slipping and I'm just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.969 
template from slipping and I'm just
cutting<00:01:19.020> around<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.530> edge<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:21.979> now

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
cutting around the edge like that now

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
cutting around the edge like that now
Elizabeth<00:01:23.369> who<00:01:23.729> designs<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:24.479> templates

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
Elizabeth who designs these templates

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
Elizabeth who designs these templates
she<00:01:25.830> recommends<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:28.250> each<00:01:29.250> time<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> cut<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
she recommends that each time you cut a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
she recommends that each time you cut a
template<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.350> lay<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.579> front<00:01:33.500> so

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
template that you lay it in front so

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.249 
template that you lay it in front so
that<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.159> yourself<00:01:35.579> mixed<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.630> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that you don't get yourself mixed up so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
that you don't get yourself mixed up so
there's<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.770> part<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> template<00:01:38.670> there

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
there's one part of the template there

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
there's one part of the template there
already<00:01:39.829> now<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> cover<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> next

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
one so once again I put mine be on the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.620 
one so once again I put mine be on the
same<00:01:46.130> we've<00:01:47.130> seen<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> scene

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
same we've seen there and on the scene

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.970

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.460 
and there's my next piece so you can see
it's<00:02:16.190> already<00:02:16.460> starting<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.090> form<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.780> pinwheel

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
it's already starting to form a pinwheel

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's already starting to form a pinwheel
shape<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.990> one<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:22.580> forms<00:02:23.000> part<00:02:23.300> of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
shape this one here just forms part of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.510 
shape this one here just forms part of
the<00:02:23.510> background<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.260> once<00:02:24.470> again<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:25.220> just

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
the background so once again I'm just

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:42.960 
the background so once again I'm just
lining<00:02:25.790> up<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.750> scene<00:02:26.990> there

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.940 

always<00:02:43.780> important<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.320> use<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> nice<00:02:44.920> sharp

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
always important to use a nice sharp

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.730 
always important to use a nice sharp
blade

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.770 

there's<00:02:51.740> my<00:02:51.980> next<00:02:52.250> piece<00:02:52.460> there<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.630> it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
there's my next piece there so it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.330 
there's my next piece there so it's
starting<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.260> look<00:02:54.380> like<00:02:55.069> that<00:02:55.340> one<00:02:57.340> another

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
starting to look like that one another

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.130 
starting to look like that one another
thing<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.610> noticed<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.720> don't<00:02:59.900> have<00:03:00.080> a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
thing I noticed is that you don't have a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.780 
thing I noticed is that you don't have a
lot<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.319> wastage<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> dealer<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.670> it's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
lot of wastage with the dealer so it's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.960 
lot of wastage with the dealer so it's
quite<00:03:02.060> economical<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.980> lining<00:03:04.370> up<00:03:04.459> line<00:03:04.700> B

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
quite economical so lining up line B

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:32.910 
quite economical so lining up line B
again

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.800 

just<00:03:33.580> gotta<00:03:33.790> make<00:03:33.849> sure<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.450> couple

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
just gotta make sure that you couple

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.270 
just gotta make sure that you couple
those<00:03:34.900> bits<00:03:35.170> properly<00:03:35.620> there<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:38.280> already

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
those bits properly there and already

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.070 
those bits properly there and already
it's<00:03:39.700> starting<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.209> form<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.720> pinwheel<00:03:41.200> shape

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
it's starting to form a pinwheel shape

00:03:43.080 --> 00:04:16.840 
it's starting to form a pinwheel shape
my<00:03:44.080> next<00:03:44.410> one<00:03:45.000> once<00:03:46.000> again<00:03:46.620> lining<00:03:47.620> up<00:03:47.770> my<00:03:48.160> B

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.400 

they'd<00:04:17.390> be<00:04:17.450> asked<00:04:17.870> I've<00:04:18.020> already<00:04:18.260> got<00:04:18.380> a

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
they'd be asked I've already got a

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:51.670 
they'd be asked I've already got a
pinwheel<00:04:18.920> there<00:04:19.160> that's<00:04:19.670> formed

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.120 

here's<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.830> start<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.220> another<00:04:53.280> pinwheel

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.840 

cutting<00:04:59.130> another<00:04:59.400> border<00:05:00.240> piece<00:05:00.480> again<00:05:00.870> and

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.800 

Elizabeth<00:05:05.850> actually<00:05:06.180> showed<00:05:06.360> me<00:05:06.480> with<00:05:06.600> some

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
Elizabeth actually showed me with some

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.630 
Elizabeth actually showed me with some
of<00:05:06.930> her<00:05:07.110> quills<00:05:07.440> how<00:05:07.710> she<00:05:07.770> does<00:05:08.130> different

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
of her quills how she does different

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.340 
of her quills how she does different
border<00:05:09.000> strips<00:05:09.330> around<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.840> edge<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.230> it

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
border strips around the edge and it

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.050 
border strips around the edge and it
gives<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.620> really<00:05:10.650> fantastic<00:05:11.130> effect<00:05:14.060> almost

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
gives a really fantastic effect almost

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:29.400 
gives a really fantastic effect almost
gives<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.480> color<00:05:15.720> wash<00:05:15.960> effect

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.170 

there's<00:05:29.950> another<00:05:30.250> corner<00:05:30.730> piece<00:05:31.000> there

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
there's another corner piece there

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.490 
there's another corner piece there
another<00:05:34.180> thing<00:05:34.390> Elizabeth<00:05:34.810> recommends<00:05:35.290> is

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
another thing Elizabeth recommends is

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.530 
another thing Elizabeth recommends is
that<00:05:35.710> if<00:05:36.070> you're<00:05:36.310> working<00:05:36.520> on<00:05:36.790> quite<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.210> large

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
that if you're working on quite a large

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.330 
that if you're working on quite a large
quilt<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:39.430> cut<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.880> rose<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.830> then<00:05:41.830> sell<00:05:42.190> a

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
quilt to cut the rose and then sell a

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.160 
quilt to cut the rose and then sell a
row<00:05:42.490> together<00:05:42.910> and<00:05:43.300> then<00:05:43.750> don't<00:05:43.960> start

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
row together and then don't start

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.750 
row together and then don't start
cutting<00:05:44.530> your<00:05:44.650> next<00:05:44.920> row<00:05:45.100> until<00:05:45.370> you've<00:05:45.490> sewn

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
cutting your next row until you've sewn

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.670 
cutting your next row until you've sewn
your<00:05:45.940> first<00:05:46.120> one<00:05:46.360> together<00:05:46.570> otherwise<00:05:47.410> that

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
your first one together otherwise that

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.100 
your first one together otherwise that
you<00:05:47.920> might<00:05:48.070> be<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.280> little<00:05:48.430> bit<00:05:48.750> mixed<00:05:49.750> up<00:05:49.900> with

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
you might be a little bit mixed up with

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.660 
you might be a little bit mixed up with
where<00:05:50.290> you're<00:05:50.410> sewing<00:05:50.680> your<00:05:50.770> pieces<00:05:51.220> you're

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
where you're sewing your pieces you're

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.370 
where you're sewing your pieces you're
basically<00:05:52.030> cutting<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:52.540> and<00:05:52.720> then<00:05:53.230> it's

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
basically cutting it and then it's

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.350 
basically cutting it and then it's
getting<00:05:53.530> sewn<00:05:53.890> back<00:05:54.100> together<00:05:54.310> just<00:05:55.210> like<00:05:55.330> a

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
getting sewn back together just like a

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:06.120 
getting sewn back together just like a
jigsaw<00:05:55.840> puzzle<00:05:55.870> piece

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.000 

and<00:06:06.790> then<00:06:06.970> we<00:06:07.060> just<00:06:07.240> thought<00:06:07.450> our<00:06:08.140> last<00:06:08.440> one<00:06:08.830> to

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
and then we just thought our last one to

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:32.720 
and then we just thought our last one to
cut<00:06:09.190> there

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.110 

and<00:06:33.270> there's<00:06:33.570> our<00:06:33.900> last<00:06:34.710> piece<00:06:35.160> of<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.790> puzzle

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
and there's our last piece of the puzzle

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.810 
and there's our last piece of the puzzle
there<00:06:39.680> so<00:06:40.680> you<00:06:40.740> can<00:06:40.980> see<00:06:41.220> now<00:06:41.430> what<00:06:41.580> you<00:06:41.670> would

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
there so you can see now what you would

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.690 
there so you can see now what you would
do<00:06:41.910> is<00:06:42.000> separate<00:06:42.420> it<00:06:43.040> join<00:06:44.040> it<00:06:44.070> in<00:06:44.310> two<00:06:44.490> rows

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
do is separate it join it in two rows

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.250 
do is separate it join it in two rows
and<00:06:45.210> then<00:06:45.900> join<00:06:46.170> the<00:06:46.200> rows<00:06:47.100> together<00:06:48.260> so

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
and then join the rows together so

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.860 
and then join the rows together so
that's<00:06:49.440> your<00:06:49.620> four<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:49.950> a<00:06:49.980> half<00:06:50.010> inch<00:06:50.430> and

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
that's your four and a half inch and

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.360 
that's your four and a half inch and
obviously<00:06:51.870> your<00:06:52.290> six<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:52.710> a<00:06:52.740> half<00:06:52.770> inch<00:06:53.100> would

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
obviously your six and a half inch would

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.440 
obviously your six and a half inch would
create<00:06:53.870> bigger<00:06:54.870> pinwheels
