00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.480
 The most natural expression when people yawn is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.410
 Fishing example 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.700
 It is a bath with a wide open mouth 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.750
 I may attach a picture to my mouth 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.740
 And in many cases they are small amounts 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740
 I get tears 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:04.870
 Shape of the eyebrows or wrinkles between the eyebrows vary 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.870
 It changes in accordance with the situation and emotion of the moment 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:15.290

 You can express your sleepy feeling by putting your hand on the cover 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.790

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.020
 A person is completely blind when looking asleep 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.560
 It has become expressionless basically 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:12.110
 It looks like I'm asleep enough 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.110
 You can easily understand the situation when you are asleep, etc. just by changing the habit and the mouth a little 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.670
 For example , if you make your mouth a bit smiley, it looks like you are sleeping happily 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 On the contrary, you can make your mouth pass through your ears or squeeze your teeth 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.890
 It looks like it is being scolded by frowning 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:41.380
 By still opening the mouth wide and hanging ax from the end of the mouth 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:48.670
 You can produce the situation that is framed 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:51.570

 It is almost that unconsciously Shut your eyes when you sneeze 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:20.159
 Along with that, the eyebrow also moves so much that you will often grumble 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:22.000
 When it is shown in the illustration, saliva is popping out from the mouth or the mouth is widely opened. 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:28.120

 The next one is about how good you look 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:49.629
 If you have someone like your rival, you may want to narrow your eyes slightly to look down on your opponent 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.629
 It would be good to close your eyes in a sense of being immersed in satisfaction 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:04:03.319
 The eyebrow is a hole on the base and widens the distance between the eyebrow and eyes and the eyelids. 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:10.730
 And the mouth raises the end a little and makes it grumble 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:13.599
 At this time, let the arms fold and put both hands on the waist and let the urine stand up to convey a more proud feeling

 I 've written a draft , so I can get into a pen and explain 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:02.500
 There is a tendency to distract the eyes as a feature at first of embarrassing 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:07.639
 Decided whether the shape of the mouth 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:12.030
 I will change the most important part when I am working next time 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:16.280

 At first we will smile 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:47.030
 I'm a cargo port, but I'm going to laugh at him twice in the hall 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.030
 And dye the cheek

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:22.569
