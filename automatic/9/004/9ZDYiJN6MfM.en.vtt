the<00:02:02.490> microfiber<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.420> what<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.020> call<00:02:04.200> an

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the microfiber is what we call an

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.010 
the microfiber is what we call an
artificial<00:02:05.070> leather<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.360> too<00:02:06.509> many<00:02:06.600> people

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
artificial leather and too many people

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440 
artificial leather and too many people
it<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.290> look<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.560> level<00:02:08.129> many<00:02:09.000> people<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it will look like level many people it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.080 
it will look like level many people it
will<00:02:09.539> feel<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.110> leather

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090
