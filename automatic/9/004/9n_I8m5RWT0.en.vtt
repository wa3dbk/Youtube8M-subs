00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.610
 hello how about friends a greeting here 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.010
 We're back with another simple and 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.150
 handy video tutorial well for nothing 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.720
 this video that I'm going to do to 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.430
 continuation 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.500
 it is rather exclusive for those 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.390
 users that were using the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.250
 windows xp and now you start using 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.940
 in windows 8 today I bring you a 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.410
 small trick to speed up the sending of 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:29.080
 photos mp3 videos so to send them more 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.510
 much faster in this case they are fixed 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.090
 here at the desk I have an mp3 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.500
 photo folder and a good video or 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.390
 logical if we have it for example in the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.699
 desktop we want to send it to mp3 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.769
 we would give a right mouse we would give 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.299
 send and we notice that here we have 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.030
 very few options we have folder 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.440
 compressed recipient of emails 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.589
 fans recipient documents 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.150
 dropbox desktop and dvd drive then 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.150
 well the most logical thing would be the mouse 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.180
 right copy 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.190
 go to folder my documents 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.010
 to the option in this case an mp3 mouse 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.239
 right and paste and we are good then in this 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.680
 video tutorial that will show to 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.560
 then this little trick we are going to 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.120
 doing so let's speed up that shipment to 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.020
 We are going to do the following 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.940
 I'm going to show the keyboard on the screen 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.860
 to see so that it is fixed in the key 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.530
 that we would have to press and so that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.960
 see what would become a symbol of 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.180
 windows r we write in the window 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.320
 execute write or sk to show the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.490
 keyboard 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.800
 well you can do 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.600
 directly from your computer keyboard 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.680
 well once we have on the keyboard 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.930
 simply what we have to do 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.729
 let's select the mp3 what 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.950
 we select press the key 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.340
 capital or shift and now if we look 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.930
 let's go to the mp3 we give you right mouse and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 we see that we have many more here 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.430
 options we have then the search 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.259
 contacts downloads desk or in my 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.640
 music my documents images and so on 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.160
 z then what we should do 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.930
 it's my music we give it and we'll send it 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.790
 to music 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.760
 folder with photos is already mind 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.420
 same a while a right and send to 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.420
 images 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 and the video exactly the same the mouse 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.300
 right with the pressed key of schiphol 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.490
 capital letter and send 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.250
 to my videos 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.260
 and we will send it directly if they are fixed 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.670
 in much more faster and other we can 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.930
 do on the fly simply with 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 Press the keyboard without having to show 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.610
 On-screen keyboard simply with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.090
 choose the file we want to send and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.070
 where do we want to send it, click on 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.290
 capitalized or shift and send it with more 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.970
 options look friends what said as to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.320

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.300
