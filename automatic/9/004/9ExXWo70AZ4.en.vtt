when a person uses the puffer the gas

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.080 
when a person uses the puffer the gas
goes<00:00:36.840> by<00:00:37.020> force<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.559> lungs<00:00:37.969> expands<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
lungs it's not a food it doesn't go into

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
lungs it's not a food it doesn't go into
the<00:00:45.750> stomach<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.920> only<00:00:47.190> gas<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the stomach and it's only gas so

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
the stomach and it's only gas so
diseases<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.450> break<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> fast<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> person

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
diseases not break the fast if a person

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.490 
diseases not break the fast if a person
uses<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.160> puffer<00:00:50.989> f-five<00:00:51.989> oxygen<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
uses the puffer f-five oxygen is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.479 
uses the puffer f-five oxygen is
concerned<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.980> too

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
concerned that too

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090 
concerned that too
it's<00:00:53.789> inhaled<00:00:54.329> goes<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> lungs<00:00:55.289> comes<00:00:55.920> out

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
it's inhaled goes in the lungs comes out

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's inhaled goes in the lungs comes out
so<00:00:56.670> oxygen<00:00:56.969> Percy<00:00:57.449> also<00:00:57.660> does<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:57.989> break<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
so oxygen Percy also does not break the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
so oxygen Percy also does not break the
first<00:00:59.160> does<00:00:59.789> not<00:00:59.940> invalidate<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
first does not invalidate the first but

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.310 
first does not invalidate the first but
as<00:01:01.590> far<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.859> vaporizers<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.789> concerned

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
as far as vaporizers are concerned

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
as far as vaporizers are concerned
vaporizers<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> different<00:01:05.159> types<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
vaporizers can be of different types can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.800 
vaporizers can be of different types can
be<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.330> form<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> liquid<00:01:07.220> can<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.250> gaseous<00:01:08.810> form

pressed the pressure which comes and by

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
pressed the pressure which comes and by
pressure<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.580> enters<00:01:21.270> into<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> lungs<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.030> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
pressure it enters into the lungs and it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.359 
pressure it enters into the lungs and it
may<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.299> through<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> nozzle<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.040> through<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
may be through a nozzle can be through a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.420 
may be through a nozzle can be through a
mask<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> enters<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> lungs<00:01:28.680> there

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mask but when it enters the lungs there

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.530 
mask but when it enters the lungs there
are<00:01:29.520> high<00:01:29.640> chances<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.420> are

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
are high chances that there are

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
are high chances that there are
particles<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.619> may<00:01:31.799> even<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
particles which may even go into the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
particles which may even go into the
stomach<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> reason<00:01:34.740> most<00:01:34.860> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
stomach so that is the reason most of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
stomach so that is the reason most of
the<00:01:35.189> scholars<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.869> vaporizes<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the scholars say that vaporizes as the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
the scholars say that vaporizes as the
treatment<00:01:37.500> first<00:01:37.680> thamma<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.579> break<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
treatment first thamma it will break the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.950 
treatment first thamma it will break the
fast<00:01:39.320> as<00:01:40.320> far<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.950> capsules<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.520> concerned

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
fast as far as capsules are concerned

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
fast as far as capsules are concerned
the<00:01:42.960> capsules<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:43.770> contain<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> medicine

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the capsules they contain the medicine

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.289 
the capsules they contain the medicine
in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.720> form<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.229> powder<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.850> has<00:01:47.909> a

in the form of a powder it has a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.749 
in the form of a powder it has a
covering<00:01:48.689> once<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.770> put<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.460> container

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
covering once you put in the container

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.179 
covering once you put in the container
and<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> pressure<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> released<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and when the pressure is released it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
and when the pressure is released it
comes<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.579> by<00:01:53.729> force<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> too<00:01:55.200> can

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
comes out by force but this too can

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.160 
comes out by force but this too can
enter<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> stomach<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.820> particles<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.930> even

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
enter the stomach the particles so even

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.170 
enter the stomach the particles so even
using<00:01:58.500> these<00:01:58.619> capsules<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.909> trip<00:02:00.030> nervous

using these capsules at the trip nervous
coma<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.740> surely<00:02:01.950> break<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> fast<00:02:02.490> so

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
coma it will surely break the fast so

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.429 
coma it will surely break the fast so
only<00:02:03.270> two<00:02:03.450> things<00:02:03.659> which<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.869> permitted<00:02:04.110> as
