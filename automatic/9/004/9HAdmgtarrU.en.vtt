now you want to do about 10 or 15 rounds

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
now you want to do about 10 or 15 rounds
of<00:01:23.369> these<00:01:23.630> depending<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:25.050> your<00:01:25.320> stamina

just<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.830> easy<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:30.080> so<00:01:31.080> what<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
just be easy with it so what is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.050 
just be easy with it so what is
essentially<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> difference<00:01:32.220> between<00:01:32.760> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
essentially the difference between the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.289 
essentially the difference between the
dynamic<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> static<00:01:34.380> pose<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:35.090> static<00:01:36.090> pose

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
dynamic in a static pose a static pose

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
dynamic in a static pose a static pose
additive<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.440> helps<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> build<00:01:38.310> strength

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
additive it helps you to build strength

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.350 
additive it helps you to build strength
in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> muscle<00:01:40.049> while<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> dynamic<00:01:41.549> pose<00:01:41.790> gives

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
in the muscle while a dynamic pose gives

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
in the muscle while a dynamic pose gives
the<00:01:42.540> muscle<00:01:42.930> tone<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the muscle tone so that is the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
the muscle tone so that is the
difference<00:01:44.940> between<00:01:45.000> both<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.960> actually<00:01:46.409> get

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
difference between both to actually get

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.100 
difference between both to actually get
proper<00:01:47.460> shape<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.060> build<00:01:48.330> strength<00:01:48.600> into<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
proper shape and build strength into the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
proper shape and build strength into the
muscle<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.340> need<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.850> both<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
muscle you actually need to do both of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.500 
muscle you actually need to do both of
these<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.619> next<00:01:53.030> person<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.330> are<00:01:54.360> going

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
these the next person that we are going

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.390 
these the next person that we are going
to<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> buck<00:01:55.140> Aspen<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.220> will

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
to do is buck Aspen which I will

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.050 
to do is buck Aspen which I will
demonstrate<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.479> relax

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.140 

so<00:02:01.750> we<00:02:01.900> start<00:02:02.229> with<00:02:02.320> our<00:02:02.470> feet<00:02:02.830> together<00:02:03.150> we

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
so we start with our feet together we

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.680 
so we start with our feet together we
take<00:02:04.360> our<00:02:04.540> hands<00:02:04.900> up<00:02:05.190> exhale<00:02:06.190> slowly<00:02:07.119> bring

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
take our hands up exhale slowly bring

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.559 
take our hands up exhale slowly bring
your<00:02:08.050> hands<00:02:08.410> down<00:02:08.850> when<00:02:09.850> you've<00:02:10.030> touched<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
your hands down when you've touched the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.480 
your hands down when you've touched the
floor<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.080> you're<00:02:11.260> balancing<00:02:11.890> well<00:02:12.130> enough

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
floor and you're balancing well enough

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.320 
floor and you're balancing well enough
then<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.780> raise<00:02:14.050> one<00:02:14.350> leg<00:02:14.590> up<00:02:14.980> as<00:02:15.220> high<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:16.150> you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
then you raise one leg up as high as you

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.620 
then you raise one leg up as high as you
can<00:02:16.510> take<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.990> oh<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:18.910> think<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.450> would

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
can take it oh I don't think I would

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.490 
can take it oh I don't think I would
attempt<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:24.209> look<00:02:25.209> too<00:02:25.420> easy<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.989> it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
attempt this just look too easy and it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.320 
attempt this just look too easy and it
might<00:02:26.709> take<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.040> some<00:02:27.069> time<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.730> perfect<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
might take you some time to perfect the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.600 
might take you some time to perfect the
essence<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:29.020> doesn't<00:02:29.350> matter<00:02:29.530> what<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.220> can

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
essence it doesn't matter what you can

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.660 
essence it doesn't matter what you can
actually<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.690> use<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.860> support<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.430> wall

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
actually do is use the support of a wall

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.550 
actually do is use the support of a wall
or<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.390> can<00:02:34.540> put<00:02:34.690> your<00:02:34.810> hands<00:02:35.110> against<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
or you can put your hands against a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.640 
or you can put your hands against a
chair<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.220> would<00:02:36.519> make<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.820> easier<00:02:40.650> the
