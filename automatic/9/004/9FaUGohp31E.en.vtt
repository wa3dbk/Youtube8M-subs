00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.629

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.429

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.990

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.130

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.769
 same to the tent by car 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.269
 so I decided to order pegs for 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.050
 sticks because last year we 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.939
 teams 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 would lose about two thirds of the warehouse 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.520
 the right amount of heads for the wand as 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 it happened I myself don't know everything 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 Carefully handle yet 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.940
 pegs weeks looked decided to order from 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 China 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 why from China why not made myself 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.590
 on fig we don't need to look for metal somewhere 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.059

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.870
 more now it's not easy anymore 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 the USSR for every piece of crap 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.199
 iron need to run homeless cursed all 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.629
 passed in tsvetmet in chermet nothing on the street 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.260
 not lying so I entered just 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.479
 ordered two kinds of pegs from china here 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 Kotyary here look after me to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.909
 did not say too much was not too lazy somewhere 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.909
 a month ago it's done here today 1 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 March two packages came, I have them of course 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:27.119
 gutted this vessel of beating little books 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:31.740
 shelf pegs I will get contents 1 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.990
 the package I generally shook with the fact that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.810
 every peg 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.210
 packed in an individual bag on 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.110
 the fig it was necessary to the Chinese 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.340
 we do not understand here the 6th gun body is necessary 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:54.420
 give birth here are they let's geometry 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.870
 I will immediately say the length is not very big 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 17 half from 18 centimeters 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.770
 friend packed of course gorgeous 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.400
 pleased me this case 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 6 pegs sachets will be useful I never 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.750
 by the way packing 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.700
 deeds at heart is what china sends or 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.920
 someone else never throws the light 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.110
 why small bags 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.820
 simple reason why litter when 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.950
 can come in handy again a chest of drawers somewhere 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.140
 send this whole thing or how else can 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.350
 use two three times 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:45.459
 personally I do not fight and that's a tidy room 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:46.410
 one or number two them are you more whole 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.770
 a bunch 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.860
 the first were six in the pack of these 20 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:00.850
 believe counted leave alone apologize 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.600
 for nonsense, they work on the discs that is 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.320
 That's how I got 6 pegs like this 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 here is the material aluminum and 20 pegs well 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.870
 here such 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:23.170
 y triangular cross section here is such 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.880
 the tip well is not particularly acute aluminum 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.810
 but here under sharpened more or less 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.239
 at prices here these are callas option number 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.450
 one cost about well not very 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.860
 cheap of course by Chinese standards 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.250
 about six dollar per pack then 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.040
 there is every cold steel dollar these 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.500
 cost less than 12 dollars cost 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.500
 a pack that is 60 cents each count 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.250
 on such cute pegs 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.810
 that I can tell from them first 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.730
 certainly not impressed that there is 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.570
 Well, of course you can also bend them 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.810
 speed up 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:11.490
 but it looks decent enough decent 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.590
 callas for money here these 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.450
 packing number two of the parcel number 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.430
 two as far as I understand it is Chinese 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.430
 copy of the famous peg in the company 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.130
 Hillenberg which costs about 30 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.240
 ten euro . 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:32.090
 drink of course bend at all even close 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:37.080
 not good good mugs 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.560
 Of course practice will show all 20 of these. 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.790
 kolov it turned out 6 such kolov compare 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 by its or pegs it 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.310
 standard calla from the tent as she is not 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.430
 were called 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.490
 limerick 4 company green st yes old 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.840
 my kind boat is difficult at all 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.160
 Itâ€™s probably 7 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.540
 or season 8 has gone 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.360
 but, all the less, the pegs are at a loss 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.750
 they do not paint steel hockey head 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.500
 paint will not disappear and therefore a replacement 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.450
 decided to take this wasp not very expensive 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.760
 decided not to bother even there himself not 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.880
 the washcloth was made not to do it nafig 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.030
 it should be spacious spends on nonsense 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.210
 that's what we are for this peg well 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.280
 I have six relatives left all 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:38.860
 it's twenty thirty six pieces 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:41.370
 meaning in what are ready pegs that is not 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.530
 what to think is not necessary 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.300
 18 dollars a full set of strip me 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.550
 turned out 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.400
 maybe it's not really cheap, but there is 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.730
 one more such subtlety 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.690
 peg 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.380
 atari costs 60 cents a copy of a company 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.690
 Hillenberg 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.610
 but I am sure that the Chinese have nothing 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:10.169
 invented just stupidly copied 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:15.010
 weighs 13 grams one this peg 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:18.190
 weighs 20 grams 1 but this is a native count 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:21.460
 whole 42 grams since 25 pieces 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.520
 approximately in the complete set count if you 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.390
 walk what is the difference in weight 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.040
 i.e. this kit is a kilo 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:35.169
 a set of these stakes here is half a kilo 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.800
 a set from such pegs how many 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.350
 1325 multiply and less than half a kilo 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.240
 It turns out that these are of course very me 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.240
 pleased that bright beautiful 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:53.080
 inexpensive cling to them conveniently and 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:59.270
 also tested so slightly 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:02.720
 quite go well here hook of course 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.930
 no question at all sharpened 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.360
 such a thing as in Chinese but 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.460
 less 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.730
 actually what's the point of buying 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.990
 pegs I think that not for long and 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:22.060
 Normally, you will stretch your wand 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:27.410
 I native tent weight, respectively 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:31.210
 reduced sets and seriously well 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:34.010
 something like this is all about it 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.890
 see I can give you all the links below 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:40.400
 you don't need these pegs for quality 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:44.000
 of course after the first exit will be needed 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.510
 report good bad all and in 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.510
 bye everyone
