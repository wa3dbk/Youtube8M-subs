00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.650 
need calcium for their neurological
system<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.760> goes<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.300> withdraws

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
system and it goes in it withdraws

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.050 
system and it goes in it withdraws
calcium<00:02:38.170> from<00:02:38.320> this<00:02:38.530> bone<00:02:38.740> bank<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:39.850> that's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
calcium from this bone bank but that's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.630 
calcium from this bone bank but that's
only<00:02:40.270> half<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.780> equation<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.430> your

only half the equation just like your

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
bank account you can only withdraw so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.590 
bank account you can only withdraw so
long<00:02:45.190> before<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.820> have<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.180> make<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.360> deposit
