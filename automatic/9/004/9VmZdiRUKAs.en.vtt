I always find a really difficult
question<00:00:15.280> to<00:00:15.550> answer<00:00:15.670> because<00:00:16.240> I<00:00:16.420> don't<00:00:16.600> think

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660

it's something that you suddenly make a
decision<00:00:18.220> that<00:00:18.340> medicine<00:00:18.550> is<00:00:18.700> what<00:00:18.850> you<00:00:18.940> want

to<00:00:19.240> do<00:00:19.420> I<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:20.680> enjoyed<00:00:20.920> science<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.670> I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
to do I really enjoyed science and I

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.310 
to do I really enjoyed science and I
enjoy<00:00:22.000> talking<00:00:22.450> to<00:00:22.630> people<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:23.110> seeing

about<00:00:29.199> each<00:00:29.470> individual<00:00:29.980> person<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.449> I

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
about each individual person and I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.670 
about each individual person and I
thought<00:00:31.780> the<00:00:31.900> medicine<00:00:32.199> was<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.349> good<00:00:32.529> way<00:00:32.650> to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
thought the medicine was a good way to

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.760 
thought the medicine was a good way to
get<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.730> speak<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.059> people<00:00:34.420> but<00:00:34.989> incorporate

get to speak to people but incorporate

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.140 
get to speak to people but incorporate
the<00:00:35.890> academic<00:00:36.280> side<00:00:36.460> of<00:00:36.550> science<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.059> I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
the academic side of science that I

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the academic side of science that I
already<00:00:37.330> enjoyed<00:00:37.629> as<00:00:37.809> well

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
already enjoyed as well

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.700 
already enjoyed as well
and<00:00:39.510> apart<00:00:40.510> from<00:00:40.629> wanting<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.260> be<00:00:41.379> here<00:00:41.470> jogged

and apart from wanting to be here jogged

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.580 
and apart from wanting to be here jogged
from<00:00:41.980> about<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.309> age<00:00:42.400> of<00:00:42.519> six<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.230> once<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.379> got

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
from about the age of six and once I got

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.799 
from about the age of six and once I got
to<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.100> age<00:00:45.130> about<00:00:45.370> 15<00:00:45.880> I<00:00:46.120> realized<00:00:46.480> well<00:00:46.600> just

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
to the age about 15 I realized well just

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.479 
to the age about 15 I realized well just
study<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.290> science-based<00:00:47.800> subject<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:48.460> I

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
study a science-based subject so I

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.889 
study a science-based subject so I
looked<00:00:48.760> at<00:00:48.940> various<00:00:49.270> other<00:00:49.510> courses

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
looked at various other courses

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.810 
looked at various other courses
available<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.649> realized<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.700> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
available and realized that the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.630 
available and realized that the
combination<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.570> study<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:53.079> science<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
combination of the study of science and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.490 
combination of the study of science and
human<00:00:55.000> body<00:00:55.210> along<00:00:55.570> with<00:00:55.600> interacting<00:00:56.410> with

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
human body along with interacting with

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.470 
human body along with interacting with
people<00:00:56.710> was<00:00:57.520> a<00:00:57.550> combination<00:00:58.149> of<00:00:58.210> all<00:00:58.360> my

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
people was a combination of all my

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.869 
people was a combination of all my
favorite<00:00:58.870> things<00:00:58.899> as<00:00:59.410> I<00:00:59.559> decided<00:00:59.890> I<00:01:00.280> pursue<00:01:00.760> it

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
favorite things as I decided I pursue it

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.200 
favorite things as I decided I pursue it
from<00:01:01.059> then<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:03.129> well<00:01:03.760> I've<00:01:03.820> got<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:03.969> background

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
from then and well I've got a background

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.600 
from then and well I've got a background
in<00:01:04.690> with<00:01:05.680> an<00:01:05.770> undergraduate<00:01:06.190> degree<00:01:06.550> in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
in with an undergraduate degree in

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.210 
in with an undergraduate degree in
psychology<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:08.410> then<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:08.710> went<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.100> do<00:01:09.190> a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
psychology and then I went on to do a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.370 
psychology and then I went on to do a
master's<00:01:09.640> in<00:01:09.670> medical<00:01:10.149> anthropology<00:01:10.810> which

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
master's in medical anthropology which

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.990 
master's in medical anthropology which
sort<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.649> opened<00:01:12.009> my<00:01:12.130> eyes<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.670> sort<00:01:12.850> of<00:01:12.910> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
sort of opened my eyes to sort of the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.670 
sort of opened my eyes to sort of the
different<00:01:13.360> sort<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.539> health<00:01:14.320> care<00:01:14.530> systems

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
different sort of health care systems

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.770 
different sort of health care systems
around<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.369> world<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:16.030> how<00:01:16.210> other<00:01:16.390> people

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
around the world and how other people

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.169 
around the world and how other people
sort<00:01:16.899> of<00:01:16.990> perceive<00:01:17.380> medicine<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.670> issues

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
sort of perceive medicine and issues

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.719 
sort of perceive medicine and issues
like<00:01:19.270> health<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.020> death<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:20.950> dying<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
like health and death and dying and the

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.520 
like health and death and dying and the
processes<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.420> those<00:01:22.569> and<00:01:22.929> it<00:01:23.289> was<00:01:23.410> that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
processes of those and it was that

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.529 
processes of those and it was that
really<00:01:23.709> that<00:01:23.890> got<00:01:24.069> me<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.520> interested<00:01:25.270> in

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
really that got me and interested in

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.780 
really that got me and interested in
going<00:01:25.840> into<00:01:25.990> medicine

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.470 

in<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.900> first<00:01:33.110> couple<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.530> years<00:01:33.770> you're

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
in the first couple of years you're

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.630 
in the first couple of years you're
learning<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.600> lot<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:36.100> Sciences<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.430> on

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
learning a lot of Sciences and so on

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.490 
learning a lot of Sciences and so on
it's<00:01:38.150> not<00:01:38.300> like<00:01:38.480> that<00:01:38.690> at<00:01:38.810> every<00:01:38.930> school<00:01:39.320> but

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
it's not like that at every school but

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.680 
it's not like that at every school but
in<00:01:39.650> most<00:01:40.160> schools<00:01:40.490> there's<00:01:40.760> there's<00:01:41.510> what's

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
in most schools there's there's what's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.870 
in most schools there's there's what's
called<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.990> preclinical<00:01:42.440> stage<00:01:42.980> when<00:01:43.760> you

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
called a preclinical stage when you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.060 
called a preclinical stage when you
learn<00:01:44.090> about<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.480> basic<00:01:44.840> sciences<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.010> you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
learn about the basic sciences so you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.730 
learn about the basic sciences so you
might<00:01:46.550> have<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.820> mixture<00:01:47.210> lectures<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.320> group

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
might have a mixture lectures and group

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.870 
might have a mixture lectures and group
work<00:01:48.980> looking<00:01:49.850> at<00:01:49.970> different<00:01:50.660> different

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
work looking at different different

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.330 
work looking at different different
conditions<00:01:52.880> different<00:01:53.920> systems<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.160> body

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
conditions different systems in the body

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.750 
conditions different systems in the body
so<00:01:55.580> for<00:01:55.610> example<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:56.600> might<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.470> day<00:01:58.460> when

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
so for example you might have a day when

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.510 
so for example you might have a day when
you<00:01:58.970> go<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.290> you're<00:02:00.830> presented<00:02:01.310> with<00:02:01.340> a

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
you go in and you're presented with a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.370
