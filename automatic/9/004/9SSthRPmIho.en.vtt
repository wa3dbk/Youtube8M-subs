00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is in third person it is on console so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.290 
is in third person it is on console so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and this is them when they were doing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.230 
and this is them when they were doing
the<00:01:05.460> testing<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> game<00:01:06.570> overall<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the testing for the game overall so the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
the testing for the game overall so the
question<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> games<00:01:10.799> obviously

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070

while<00:02:35.310> playing<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.790> third-person<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.780> almost

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
while playing in third-person I almost

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.509 
while playing in third-person I almost
feel<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.890> playing<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.220> completely

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
feel like I'm playing a completely

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.850 
feel like I'm playing a completely
different<00:02:39.000> game<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.140> visuals<00:02:40.739> are

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
different game it's the visuals are

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.640 
different game it's the visuals are
there<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:42.360> hard<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.720> explain<00:02:43.049> but<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.440> very

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
there it's hard to explain but it's very

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.410 
there it's hard to explain but it's very
strange<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.370> want<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.610> test<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.000> out<00:02:45.090> I'd

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
strange if you want to test it out I'd

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.880 
strange if you want to test it out I'd
highly<00:02:45.989> recommend<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.739> interesting

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
highly recommend it but it's interesting

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.699 
highly recommend it but it's interesting
because<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.120> combat<00:02:48.540> definitely<00:02:49.170> feels<00:02:49.530> like

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
because the combat definitely feels like

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.589 
because the combat definitely feels like
something<00:02:50.250> pulled<00:02:50.489> right<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.970> Assassin's

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
something pulled right out of Assassin's

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.449 
something pulled right out of Assassin's
Creed<00:02:51.900> or<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.380> Prince<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.069> Persia<00:02:53.190> or

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
Creed or like Prince of Persia or

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.809 
Creed or like Prince of Persia or
something<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.049> different<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.489> I

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
something it's so different to see I

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.580 
something it's so different to see I
mean<00:02:57.030> obviously<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.569> know<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:58.019> your<00:02:58.410> other

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
mean obviously we know what your other

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.809 
mean obviously we know what your other
character<00:02:58.950> looks<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.250> when<00:02:59.519> you're<00:02:59.640> playing

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
character looks like when you're playing

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.970 
character looks like when you're playing
with<00:03:00.000> multiplayer<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:01.319> dying<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.799> your

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
with multiplayer and dying like your

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.199 
with multiplayer and dying like your
friends<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.549> cooperative<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:05.209> it's

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
friends and cooperative and it's

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.120 
friends and cooperative and it's
interesting<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.930> think<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.470> what<00:03:07.799> would<00:03:07.980> have

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
interesting to think of what would have

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.809 
interesting to think of what would have
happened<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:09.480> they<00:03:10.049> made<00:03:10.380> dying<00:03:10.950> light<00:03:11.310> into<00:03:11.790> a

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
happened if they made dying light into a

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.849 
happened if they made dying light into a
third<00:03:12.150> person<00:03:12.630> game<00:03:12.840> also<00:03:13.109> another<00:03:13.590> thing

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
do have a fairly decent computer and it

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.440 
do have a fairly decent computer and it
cannot<00:03:29.880> handle<00:03:30.540> um<00:03:31.190> or<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.400> program<00:03:33.120> itself

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450

cannot handle you actually running in
third<00:03:35.730> person<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.260> makes<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.680> interesting

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
third person so it makes it interesting

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.520 
third person so it makes it interesting
to<00:03:38.459> think<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.940> maybe<00:03:39.239> dying<00:03:39.840> light<00:03:40.079> wouldn't

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
to think that maybe dying light wouldn't

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.930 
to think that maybe dying light wouldn't
have<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.889> success<00:03:41.459> because<00:03:41.790> there's

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
have the success because there's

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.460 
have the success because there's
millions<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.510> people<00:03:42.569> who<00:03:42.959> playing<00:03:43.230> died

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
millions of people who playing died

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.500 
millions of people who playing died
light<00:03:43.769> every<00:03:44.130> day<00:03:44.340> there's<00:03:44.940> millions<00:03:45.209> of

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
light every day there's millions of

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.150 
light every day there's millions of
copies<00:03:45.720> sold<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.290> can't<00:03:46.530> remember<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.889> number

play I am imagining the success wouldn't
have<00:03:52.680> been<00:03:52.859> as<00:03:53.099> big<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.639> if<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.940> wasn't<00:03:54.269> in

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
have been as big as if it wasn't in

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.300 
have been as big as if it wasn't in
first<00:03:54.630> person<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.410> what's<00:03:55.560> interesting<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:56.190> it

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
first person so what's interesting is it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.770 
first person so what's interesting is it
actually<00:03:56.790> may<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.030> started<00:03:57.359> as<00:03:57.599> an

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
actually may have started as an

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420 
actually may have started as an
open-world<00:03:58.290> third-person<00:03:58.829> game<00:03:59.250> like

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
open-world third-person game like

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.150 
open-world third-person game like
assassin's<00:04:00.030> creed<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.630> felt<00:04:01.290> too<00:04:01.620> much<00:04:01.859> like

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
assassin's creed it felt too much like

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.009 
assassin's creed it felt too much like
it<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.609> maybe<00:04:02.910> that's<00:04:03.150> why<00:04:03.359> they<00:04:03.510> decided<00:04:03.660> to

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
it and maybe that's why they decided to

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.199 
it and maybe that's why they decided to
go<00:04:04.200> first-person<00:04:04.980> obviously<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.090> all

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
go first-person obviously this is all

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.809 
go first-person obviously this is all
speculation<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.200> hearsay<00:04:08.160> because<00:04:08.370> there's

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
speculation and hearsay because there's

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.460 
speculation and hearsay because there's
no<00:04:08.970> proof<00:04:09.269> behind<00:04:09.659> it<00:04:09.810> other<00:04:09.959> than<00:04:10.170> what<00:04:10.349> I've

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
no proof behind it other than what I've

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.899 
no proof behind it other than what I've
showed<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.760> just<00:04:11.819> very

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
showed you but it's just very

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.559 
showed you but it's just very
interesting<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.900> think<00:04:12.930> about

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
interesting to think about

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.600 
interesting to think about
that<00:04:14.019> dynamite<00:04:14.799> could<00:04:15.040> have<00:04:15.129> been<00:04:15.280> in<00:04:15.400> third

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
that dynamite could have been in third

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.249 
that dynamite could have been in third
person<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.209> how<00:04:16.329> weird<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.870> because<00:04:17.109> it's

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
person and how weird it is because it's

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.680 
person and how weird it is because it's
super<00:04:17.560> sketchy<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.250> wish<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.239> could<00:04:19.359> get<00:04:19.449> through

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
super sketchy I wish I could get through

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.150 
super sketchy I wish I could get through
there<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.079> only<00:04:20.229> lasts<00:04:20.620> for<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.799> couple<00:04:21.100> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
there but it only lasts for a couple of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.830 
there but it only lasts for a couple of
minutes<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:21.729> always<00:04:21.940> glitched<00:04:22.360> out<00:04:22.539> for

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
minutes and it's always glitched out for

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.200 
minutes and it's always glitched out for
me<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.080> super<00:04:23.680> super<00:04:23.889> weird<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.910> only<00:04:25.090> way

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
me it's super super weird the only way

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.029 
me it's super super weird the only way
to<00:04:25.270> do<00:04:25.449> it<00:04:25.570> is<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.870> play<00:04:26.050> on<00:04:26.259> really<00:04:26.830> low

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
to do it is to play on really low

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.240 
to do it is to play on really low
performance<00:04:27.729> points<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.470> just<00:04:29.949> can't<00:04:30.130> do

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
performance points and I just can't do

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.680 
performance points and I just can't do
that<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.430> dying<00:04:30.729> light<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.090> make<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.360> look<00:04:31.509> like

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
that to dying light to make it look like

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.040 
that to dying light to make it look like
that

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
that

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.110 
that
so<00:04:32.740> it's<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:32.919> interesting<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.699> looks<00:04:33.880> weird

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
so it's just interesting it looks weird

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.120 
so it's just interesting it looks weird

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
surprising that I'm actually surprised

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.420 
surprising that I'm actually surprised
that<00:05:34.270> hasn't<00:05:34.449> crashed<00:05:34.840> considering<00:05:35.800> just

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
that hasn't crashed considering just

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.700 
that hasn't crashed considering just
this<00:05:36.610> whole<00:05:36.909> thing<00:05:37.270> it's<00:05:38.229> it's<00:05:38.620> very

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
this whole thing it's it's very

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.350 
this whole thing it's it's very
interesting<00:05:39.340> though<00:05:39.760> just<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.060> whole

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
interesting though just the whole

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.480 
interesting though just the whole
grappling<00:05:40.960> can<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:41.560> actually<00:05:41.710> see<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.190> line

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
grappling can you actually see the line

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.550 
grappling can you actually see the line
though<00:05:42.760> when<00:05:43.630> you're<00:05:43.750> grappling<00:05:43.990> let's<00:05:44.409> wait

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
though when you're grappling let's wait

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.060 
though when you're grappling let's wait
for<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.889> recharge<00:05:45.960> no<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.440> actually<00:05:47.650> can't

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
for it to recharge no you actually can't

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.450 
for it to recharge no you actually can't
see<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.430> line<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.120> almost<00:05:49.360> looks<00:05:49.630> like

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
see the line so it almost looks like

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.680 
see the line so it almost looks like
obviously<00:05:51.460> it<00:05:51.580> was<00:05:51.669> not<00:05:51.880> meant<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.300> do<00:05:52.479> this

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
obviously it was not meant to do this

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.750 
obviously it was not meant to do this
this<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.229> very<00:05:53.710> very<00:05:54.039> strange<00:05:54.430> indeed

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.820 

it<00:05:57.760> just<00:05:58.000> feels<00:05:58.270> I'm<00:05:58.570> stable<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.289> feels<00:05:59.590> like

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830
