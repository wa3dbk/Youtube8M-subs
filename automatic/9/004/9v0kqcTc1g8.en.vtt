00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.920
 the pc games hardware 6 2003 surprised 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.580
 the inclined reader with a completely new 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.139
 designed cover as you can see no 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 difference to the previous edition 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.520
 I have to confess I actually see 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.039
 no white background too much 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560
 Write something on computer 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 no, everything as usual we have to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.859
 just blind what we believe this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.699
 young man in his preface of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 supposedly new cover tells something 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.670
 better to see the innovations at 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.920
 amd 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.720
 namely bring after years 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.659
 delay finally a new one 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.170
 processor architecture from the nail 9 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:51.140
 but have you understood the hammer and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 brand new k8 also known as athlon 64 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.960
 Anyway, this month has to be 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.220
 to apply for the first time in the test 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.549
 and what do we see there at first 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.830
 look the new gets for the first time too 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.110
 a metal shell like the p4 processors 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.350
 The competition hits the boards 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.810
 But that's not all in ours 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 benchmarks beats the 1 4 gigahertz 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.399
 Prototype both the time-honored 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.890
 athlon xp as well as the pentium 4 at 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.100
 same tact and finally has the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 hammer synonymous for the first time a 64 bit mode 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.490
 just stupid that the right one 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.350
 windows version but a year on 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.539
 to wait and for a really 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.979
 you even have to have a usable 64 bit system 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.590
 wait four years 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.319
 And that's what this processor is for 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.819
 actually too slow again 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.159
 Nevertheless, given the high performance 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.869
 the hammer is a mature performance of 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.179
 one we also like from the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.929
 one or the other today's processor 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.670
 would have seen 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.679
 but somehow it is also there was indeed 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.689
 also boring if new chips always 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.819
 faster than their predecessors 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.700
 that was probably what ati thought at the time 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.530
 and nvidia and found the idea funny 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.210
 new middle class graphics chips on the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 to throw the market with their predecessors 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.670
 could not keep up 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.509
 so the new radeon 9600 was actual 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 lama as the aging 9500 nvidia 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.370
 geforce fx 5600 limped behind the 4200 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.580
 afterwards and the 9200 the radeon could 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.350
 with the old entry-level chip 9100 too 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.070
 do not keep up like thilo bayer here 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.140
 criticizes new chips so slower than 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.570
 the old good that out of it no 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.760
 tradition would otherwise be today's gps 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.780
 probably so slow that we have something like that again 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.780
 would have to play 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.120
 but as far as luckily it did not come 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.860
 this also applies to this idea at that time 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.540
 from intel processors with one 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.430
 integrated overclocking protection too 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 provided that one should prevent 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 raising the frequency 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.180
 nothing came of it, although I did not 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.710
 Surely I am not the one who has this idea 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.330
 at a certain new processor 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.770
 had picked up again 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.560
 does not really overclock 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.180
 but enough of the commonwealth what was 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.570
 nonetheless, five years ago 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.180
 the fight of dvd formats the question 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.420
 what ends up by plus or 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.880
 In any case, minus 3 beinroth is itself 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.370
 certainly dvd plus makes the race 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.370
 today we are smarter plus and minus 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.690
 live in peaceful coexistence but in 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.560
 this industry you can now times 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.180
 slightly wrong 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.709
 There is even a colleague in the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
 editorial which until recently one 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.200
 hd dvd player has bought but even 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.350
 the manufacturers are sometimes mistaken 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.810
 here, pioneers do not believe that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.100
 burn the comforting more than 8 times 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.350
 tolerate speed 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.360
 Five years later you are still at it 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.560
 20 times speed arrived 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.060
 yes, this is progress as progress 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.650
 looked five years ago 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.019
 this is documented above all by the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.200
 inconspicuous ads for mobile phone 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.840
 picture a little revolution handy 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.660
 porn for the first time in color 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.430
 not like the previous issues 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.290
 only in black and white 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.239
 actually long overdue finally 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.510
 we do not live in the age anymore 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.510
 from 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.850
 but where we are playing at what are 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.900
 was actually up to date then 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.300
 2003 major theme one internal metrics 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.190
 the most held games of his 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.300
 time we obviously did not like that 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.910
 were completely innocent 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.450
 the game itself is not so 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.450
 evil 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.810
 Berlin 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.570
 it only disturbed a little something fun 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.030
 did not really do it but at least 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.370
 was it better than matrix reloaded the 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.810
 movie on which it happened but that is 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.760
 actually no more fun art 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.260
 seeing as this movie makes a lot 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.260
 much for example 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.110
 Graphics is not everything 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.819
 still finds time bill roper 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.849
 blizzard times and gives in ours 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:11.710
 interview to for the warcraft 3 addon 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.710
 technical changes are not 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.080
 especially important is different with the 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.030
 a small online role playing game 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.210
 he is currently working on names for world of 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.599
 warcraft wants to blizzard in front of everyone 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.630
 graphically offer a lot 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:32.110
 wow I have to say that is 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.930
 really succeeded in the graphics can 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.820
 I'll buy this device right here 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.099
 a retro joystick for connection 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.440
 the tv with integrated atari 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.110
 console games classics from the 80s 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.990
 they do not look too bad either 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.529
 out as wow and guess which one 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.529
 The game is also close 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:56.129
 yes, but also michael command but above all 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.129
 this one here 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.510
 great tennis in the truest sense of the word 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.790
 and best of all, it's free 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.490
 the internet even runs on every pc 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.720
 I think I playmates on it 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.720
 until next time
