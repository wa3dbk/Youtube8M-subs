there<00:00:06.600> are<00:00:06.720> four<00:00:06.960> valves<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.560> heart<00:00:08.099> what

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
there are four valves in the heart what

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.699 
there are four valves in the heart what
heart<00:00:08.700> valves<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> they<00:00:09.629> open<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.680> close

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:10.709 
heart valves do is they open and close

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.920 
heart valves do is they open and close
and<00:00:11.340> when<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> heart<00:00:12.030> beats<00:00:12.090> generally<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
and when the heart beats generally the

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.839 
and when the heart beats generally the
valve<00:00:13.440> opens<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.309> when<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> heart<00:00:14.730> relaxes

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
valve opens and when the heart relaxes

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.150 
valve opens and when the heart relaxes
the<00:00:15.360> valve<00:00:15.540> closes<00:00:16.110> and<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.770> allows<00:00:17.130> for

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the valve closes and this allows for

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.700 
the valve closes and this allows for
blood<00:00:17.700> to<00:00:18.029> go<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.689> one<00:00:18.900> direction

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
blood to go in one direction

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.830 
blood to go in one direction
the<00:00:20.070> most<00:00:20.279> common<00:00:20.669> valve<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.240> operate<00:00:21.390> on

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the most common valve that we operate on

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
the most common valve that we operate on
is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.169> or<00:00:22.349> tack<00:00:22.470> valve<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.520> is<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:23.910> aorta

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is the or tack valve this is the aorta

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.999 
is the or tack valve this is the aorta
that's<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> large<00:00:25.050> already<00:00:25.439> leading<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.919> of

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
that's the large already leading out of

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.620 
that's the large already leading out of
the<00:00:26.070> heart<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.669> if<00:00:27.540> I<00:00:27.660> were<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> remove<00:00:27.989> this

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
the heart and if I were to remove this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
the heart and if I were to remove this
under<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.989> you<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:31.829> see<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.340> take

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
under here you would see the or take

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
under here you would see the or take
valve<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.880> aortic<00:00:33.030> valve<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> window<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
valve the aortic valve is the window of

the heart it's the last valve the blood

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
the heart it's the last valve the blood
sees<00:00:37.020> before<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.590> ejected<00:00:37.649> out<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
body in the case of aortic stenosis

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.640 
body in the case of aortic stenosis
there's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> blockage<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.260> aortic<00:00:43.590> valve

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
there's a blockage in the aortic valve

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.370 
there's a blockage in the aortic valve
and<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> valve<00:00:44.310> has<00:00:44.790> trouble<00:00:45.120> opening<00:00:45.380> you

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
and the valve has trouble opening you

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.680 
and the valve has trouble opening you
can't<00:00:46.620> usually<00:00:47.010> repair<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.060> aortic<00:00:48.660> valve

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
can't usually repair the aortic valve

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
can't usually repair the aortic valve
because<00:00:49.290> it's<00:00:49.500> typically<00:00:50.010> heavily<00:00:50.700> calcified

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because it's typically heavily calcified

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.890 
because it's typically heavily calcified
we<00:00:51.810> need<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> replace<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.770> valve<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:54.750> do

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
we need to replace the valve and we do

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900 
we need to replace the valve and we do
that<00:00:55.079> by<00:00:55.320> cutting<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.400> valve<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that by cutting out the valve and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
that by cutting out the valve and
putting<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> new<00:00:57.630> prosthetic<00:00:58.440> valve<00:00:58.649> there

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
putting in a new prosthetic valve there

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470 
putting in a new prosthetic valve there
are<00:00:59.310> two<00:00:59.880> choices

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
are two choices

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.650 
are two choices
of<00:01:00.660> prosthetic<00:01:01.440> valves<00:01:02.360> basically<00:01:03.360> there's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
of prosthetic valves basically there's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.200 
of prosthetic valves basically there's
mechanical<00:01:04.259> valves<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:06.000> are

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
mechanical valves and there are

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.219 
mechanical valves and there are
biological<00:01:06.810> valves<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:09.180> mechanical<00:01:09.749> valves

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
biological valves the mechanical valves

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.919 
biological valves the mechanical valves
are<00:01:10.439> made<00:01:10.889> out<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.490> phosphorylated<00:01:12.359> carbon

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
are made out of a phosphorylated carbon

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.919 
are made out of a phosphorylated carbon
compound<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.340> white<00:01:14.579> cloth<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.329> where<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
compound the white cloth is where we

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.590 
compound the white cloth is where we
place<00:01:16.560> our<00:01:16.740> sutures<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.389> how<00:01:18.539> we

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
place our sutures and that's how we

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.709 
place our sutures and that's how we
implant<00:01:19.079> it<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.829> heart<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.609> this<00:01:21.420> case

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
implant it into the heart in this case

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.319 
implant it into the heart in this case
it's<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.469> call<00:01:22.709> a<00:01:22.950> bileaflet<00:01:23.549> valve<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
it's what we call a bileaflet valve you

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's what we call a bileaflet valve you
can<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:24.719> see<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.469> when<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.889> opens

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
can actually see that when it opens

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
can actually see that when it opens
there<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.670> two<00:01:27.359> leaflets<00:01:28.219> when<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.369> closes

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
there are two leaflets when it closes

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.590 
there are two leaflets when it closes
the<00:01:30.149> leaflets<00:01:30.539> come<00:01:30.810> together<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the leaflets come together like that the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
the leaflets come together like that the
mechanical<00:01:34.229> valve<00:01:34.380> where<00:01:34.829> people<00:01:35.249> often

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
mechanical valve where people often

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.050 
mechanical valve where people often
refer<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:35.999> the<00:01:36.299> metal<00:01:37.020> valve<00:01:37.639> last<00:01:38.639> pretty

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
refer to as the metal valve last pretty

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840 
refer to as the metal valve last pretty
much<00:01:39.149> forever<00:01:39.649> that's<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.799> great<00:01:41.009> thing<00:01:41.249> but

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
much forever that's a great thing but

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.519 
much forever that's a great thing but
there<00:01:42.029> are<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.149> couple<00:01:42.420> downsides<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 
there are a couple downsides to the

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:46.629 
there are a couple downsides to the
mechanical<00:01:44.100> valve<00:01:44.249> the<00:01:45.029> one<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:46.200> can

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
mechanical valve the one is they can

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.089 
mechanical valve the one is they can
often<00:01:47.639> have<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.209> clicking<00:01:48.689> sound<00:01:48.719> so<00:01:49.319> that<00:01:49.529> on<00:01:50.069> a

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
often have a clicking sound so that on a

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.069 
often have a clicking sound so that on a
patient<00:01:50.609> who's<00:01:50.729> particularly<00:01:51.119> thin<00:01:51.539> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
patient who's particularly thin you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.339 
patient who's particularly thin you
might<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.439> hear<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.069> valve<00:01:53.490> clicking

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
might actually hear the valve clicking

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.959 
might actually hear the valve clicking
the<00:01:55.349> other<00:01:55.499> thing<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> mechanical<00:01:56.819> valve

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the other thing is the mechanical valve

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.769 
the other thing is the mechanical valve
requires<00:01:57.630> blood<00:01:58.439> thinners<00:01:58.889> coming<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.779> for

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779 
requires blood thinners coming in for

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.349 
requires blood thinners coming in for
the<00:02:01.109> rest<00:02:01.319> of<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.649> life<00:02:01.859> now<00:02:02.639> cumin<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
the rest of your life now cumin in is a

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.269 
the rest of your life now cumin in is a
pill<00:02:03.779> that<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.020> would<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.409> each<00:02:04.679> day<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:05.279 
pill that you would take each day and

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.129 
pill that you would take each day and
approximately<00:02:06.270> once<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.599> month<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.020> would

approximately once a month you would
need<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.499> have<00:02:07.679> your<00:02:07.979> blood<00:02:08.220> tested<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> make

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
need to have your blood tested to make

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.740 
need to have your blood tested to make
sure<00:02:09.060> your<00:02:09.270> blood<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.690> adequately<00:02:10.560> thinned

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
sure your blood is adequately thinned

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.360 
sure your blood is adequately thinned
the<00:02:12.750> other<00:02:13.140> option<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.769> series<00:02:14.340> of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the other option is a series of

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.020 
the other option is a series of
biological<00:02:14.730> valves<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.560> two<00:02:16.829> most<00:02:17.099> common

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
biological valves the two most common

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.280 
biological valves the two most common
biological<00:02:18.450> valves

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
biological valves

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.000 
biological valves
are<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.769> pig<00:02:20.640> valve<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:21.269> porcine<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.829> cow

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
are the pig valve or porcine and the cow

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.720 
are the pig valve or porcine and the cow
valve<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.609> bovine<00:02:24.510> valve<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:25.980> an<00:02:26.310> example

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
valve or bovine valve this is an example

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.199 
valve or bovine valve this is an example
of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.450> porcine<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.620> pig<00:02:28.859> valve<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:30.030> is

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
of the porcine the pig valve and this is

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.020 
of the porcine the pig valve and this is
an<00:02:30.329> example<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.590> bovine<00:02:32.459> or

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
an example of the bovine or

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.960 
an example of the bovine or
cowbell<00:02:33.719> what's<00:02:34.230> interesting<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
cowbell what's interesting is that the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.530 
cowbell what's interesting is that the
pig<00:02:36.359> valve<00:02:36.689> is<00:02:37.079> literally<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.549> pigs<00:02:38.819> valve<00:02:39.150> of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
pig valve is literally the pigs valve of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.910 
pig valve is literally the pigs valve of
the<00:02:40.349> company<00:02:41.420> harvests<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> valve<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the company harvests the valve of the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.819 
the company harvests the valve of the
pig<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.540> creates<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.780> stent<00:02:46.170> around<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
pig and creates the stent around it and

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.800 
pig and creates the stent around it and
so<00:02:46.950> you're<00:02:47.069> actually<00:02:47.220> using<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.939> pigs<00:02:48.480> valve

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so you're actually using the pigs valve

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.039 
so you're actually using the pigs valve
the<00:02:49.260> white<00:02:50.099> part<00:02:50.549> again<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.299> sewing<00:02:51.599> cuff

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
the white part again is the sewing cuff

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.309 
the white part again is the sewing cuff
and<00:02:52.349> then<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.250> see<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.930> valve

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and then you can see the the valve

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.449 
and then you can see the the valve
tissue<00:02:55.859> inside<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.810> cow<00:02:58.439> valve<00:02:58.859> is<00:02:59.280> not

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
tissue inside the cow valve is not

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.909 
tissue inside the cow valve is not
actually<00:02:59.909> the<00:02:59.939> cow's<00:03:00.209> valve<00:03:00.569> it's<00:03:00.840> cow<00:03:01.409> per

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
actually the cow's valve it's cow per

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.800 
actually the cow's valve it's cow per
car<00:03:02.340> diem<00:03:02.549> which<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.030> lining<00:03:03.269> around<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
car diem which is the lining around the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.530 
car diem which is the lining around the
heart<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.590> they<00:03:04.799> make<00:03:05.340> into<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> valve<00:03:06.329> in

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
heart that they make into a valve in

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.080 
heart that they make into a valve in
other<00:03:06.689> words<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.530> not<00:03:07.650> valve<00:03:08.099> tissue<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.790> you

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
other words it's not valve tissue it you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.000 
other words it's not valve tissue it you
can<00:03:09.239> often<00:03:09.510> think<00:03:09.689> of<00:03:09.780> as<00:03:09.989> small<00:03:10.470> pieces<00:03:10.859> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
can often think of as small pieces of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.000 
can often think of as small pieces of
leather<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.720> made<00:03:13.169> into<00:03:13.379> about<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.919> just

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
leather that is made into about it just

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.259 
leather that is made into about it just
happens<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> be<00:03:15.060> from<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:16.049> cow<00:03:16.439> so<00:03:17.090> what's<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
happens to be from a cow so what's the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.220 
happens to be from a cow so what's the
difference<00:03:18.689> well<00:03:18.870> both<00:03:19.349> are<00:03:19.620> very<00:03:19.739> good<00:03:20.099> the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
difference well both are very good the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.740 
difference well both are very good the
advantage<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:23.220> biological<00:03:23.639> valve<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.540> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
advantage of a biological valve is that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.780 
advantage of a biological valve is that
you<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.409> not<00:03:25.590> need<00:03:25.979> any<00:03:26.310> blood<00:03:26.609> thinners

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you do not need any blood thinners

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.750 
you do not need any blood thinners
except<00:03:27.389> perhaps<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:28.229> baby<00:03:28.680> aspirin<00:03:29.280> each<00:03:29.489> day

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
except perhaps a baby aspirin each day

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.860 
except perhaps a baby aspirin each day
the<00:03:31.340> biological<00:03:32.340> valves<00:03:32.549> do<00:03:33.030> not<00:03:33.180> make<00:03:33.629> any

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the biological valves do not make any

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.259 
the biological valves do not make any
clicking<00:03:34.290> sound<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.519> downside<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.239> a

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
clicking sound the downside to a

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.199 
clicking sound the downside to a
biological<00:03:36.449> valve<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.799> may<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.549> last

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
biological valve is that it may not last

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.830 
biological valve is that it may not last
forever<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.379> we<00:03:41.069> typically<00:03:41.549> will<00:03:42.120> put<00:03:42.659> these

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
forever so we typically will put these

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.710 
forever so we typically will put these
