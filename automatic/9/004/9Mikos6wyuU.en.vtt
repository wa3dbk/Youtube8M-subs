00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
virtually instantly so he can move well

that Marvel might have had in this fight

that Marvel might have had in this fight
would<00:05:32.750> have<00:05:32.840> been<00:05:32.990> his<00:05:33.110> energy<00:05:33.500> projection

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
would have been his energy projection

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.060 
would have been his energy projection
abilities<00:05:34.669> but<00:05:35.330> DC's<00:05:36.080> Captain<00:05:36.470> Marvel<00:05:36.800> does

abilities but DC's Captain Marvel does

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.370 
abilities but DC's Captain Marvel does
have<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.669> extreme<00:05:38.150> stamina<00:05:38.720> of<00:05:38.840> Atlas<00:05:39.169> which

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
have the extreme stamina of Atlas which

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.070 
have the extreme stamina of Atlas which
allows<00:05:39.680> him<00:05:40.039> to<00:05:40.280> take<00:05:40.880> on<00:05:41.120> virtually<00:05:41.630> any<00:05:41.840> kind

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
allows him to take on virtually any kind

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.830 
allows him to take on virtually any kind
of<00:05:42.229> damage<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.830> be<00:05:43.280> pretty<00:05:43.580> well<00:05:43.880> unharmed<00:05:44.600> by

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
of damage and be pretty well unharmed by

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.980 
of damage and be pretty well unharmed by
it<00:05:44.900> so<00:05:45.530> odds<00:05:45.979> are<00:05:46.430> he<00:05:46.910> would<00:05:47.030> be<00:05:47.150> able<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.479> take

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
it so odds are he would be able to take

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.440 
it so odds are he would be able to take
the<00:05:48.200> hits<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.970> Marvel<00:05:49.970> would<00:05:50.180> throw<00:05:50.419> out

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
the hits that Marvel would throw out

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.500 
the hits that Marvel would throw out
with<00:05:50.720> his<00:05:50.840> energy<00:05:51.080> projection<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:52.240> not<00:05:53.240> be

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
completely destroyed by it and then he'd

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.350 
completely destroyed by it and then he'd
be<00:05:55.940> able<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.180> go<00:05:56.360> back<00:05:56.630> at<00:05:56.900> Marvel<00:05:57.350> with<00:05:57.889> his
