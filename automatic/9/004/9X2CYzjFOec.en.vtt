00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:15.990
 the bny we here the video will be more 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.410
 a gadget with a blog design I'm 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.570
 half-hoarse so do not repair my voice 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.269
 but anyway this contraption here is that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:44.700
 people are going to learn today, I'm going to use a 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:48.840
 village could see you show 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.010
 try to try to put it to me too 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.570
 but sometimes it gives a bug today that I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:07.229
 I put up here to stay 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:10.320
 prissy and line it there maybe 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.210
 today will be about this gadget here 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 so go there for the tutorial coming back 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 so let's start there, I'll go 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 do up front has trouble 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 It's not because I'm going to make it that big. 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 everything and only then start doing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 I think the two then continue then 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:40.100
 let's make base that is ice block 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:45.409
 It's time to put the big piston in here. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.399
 so here is the correct base 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.180
 after we have made it to the base we will go 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.840
 put on 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.810
 let's make the connection system of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.610
 piston and the first of the first system 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.259
 here in the front so that's what we're going 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.259
 put a block here count nine 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.810
 123456789 after that they will put two 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.090
 receptors here 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.170
 these two front four of law this 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.850
 that leaves normal 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.070
 now is to put two blocks here is like this 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.440
 that we'll put a button and here that 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.020
 can put the network story here 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.520
 here here now make a ladder 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.520
 even about sobe here 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:49.330
 so let's go up to the history network 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.520
 put a button to go on 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.530
 flashes and the opportunity the system 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.750
 then it will move to the part of the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.420
 system 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.130
 let's go there first system that is popular 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.720
 ump bloch another place here up here 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:12.670
 also 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:16.150
 now I'll also put here here 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.000
 is the basis we do put our but 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 Our people explain our gag 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.850
 story says toni and our repeater and 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.310
 redstone so torch now I'm going to put 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.709
 a network story here and here in 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.060
 also up 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:43.360
 then repeating the old man there with 34 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.380
 of law that will already put a repeater 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.110
 to put here after the continuity 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.050
 the two also with 4 of law will pick up from 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.350
 new flooring do not know that I took to it 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.660
 here is not this one put two overturned 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.570
 down 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.180
 facing the slime blog here 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.640
 You can exactly put our beloved 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.090
 Ice, then I'll call here for people. 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.220
 see if I position here to see if 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.220
 go there 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.270
 so we will not continue the second 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.810
 part but in the second part we'll go 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.370
 put four blocks in front 1 2 1 2 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.960
 3 4 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.420
 we will do the same lic system is 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:38.450
 jump one button raise other 422 boot 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:43.140
 here are three here one ahead 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:47.100
 now a torch rates here and here 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.950
 repeating here with four of law 12 to 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.860
 that also with 4 to continue a 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.800
 here audit up here same thing 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.680
 here we will call also put our 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.330
 here are two down and forward 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.770
 block off and let's put the ice and 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.510
 here too the same thing was 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 put four blocks do that same 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.280
 system here and there only doing the same 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.450
 four blank system 4 block them 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.190
 right rights 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.990
 let's call that we saved a test that only 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.430
 to take a test 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.430
 are 10 to test the cow does not have the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.500
 working perfectly and like me 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.230
 I told you to continue, it 's just you do the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.060
 same thing put the two and I repeat 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.960
 24 block the story and do the same 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.630
 system 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.900
