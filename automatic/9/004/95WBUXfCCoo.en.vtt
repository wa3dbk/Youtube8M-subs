00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
rest because we don't really let

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.490 
rest because we don't really let
ourselves<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:20.810> i<00:02:21.380> already<00:02:21.740> said<00:02:22.040> um<00:02:23.500> and

ourselves do it as i already said um and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500 
ourselves do it as i already said um and
i<00:02:24.680> was<00:02:24.800> just<00:02:24.830> thinking<00:02:25.430> before<00:02:25.760> i<00:02:25.970> started

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
i was just thinking before i started

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.340 
i was just thinking before i started
filming<00:02:27.020> what<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.950> lived<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.460> world<00:02:29.350> we

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
filming what if we lived in a world we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.290 
filming what if we lived in a world we
live<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.860> world<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:31.970> live<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.210> a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
live in a world but what if we live in a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.830 
live in a world but what if we live in a
different<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.780> where<00:02:34.240> everybody's<00:02:35.240> basic

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
different one where everybody's basic

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.170 
different one where everybody's basic
survival<00:02:36.500> needs<00:02:36.740> were<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.400> taken<00:02:37.940> care<00:02:38.150> of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
survival needs were just taken care of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.320 
survival needs were just taken care of
we<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.810> grew<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> lot<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.800> our<00:02:39.920> own<00:02:40.070> food<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.790> we

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
we all grew a lot of our own food and we

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.450 
we all grew a lot of our own food and we
lived<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.630> more<00:02:41.930> closely<00:02:42.470> knit<00:02:42.860> communities

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
lived in more closely knit communities

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.190 
lived in more closely knit communities
so<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.820> everybody<00:02:44.300> definitely<00:02:44.900> had<00:02:44.990> enough

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
so that everybody definitely had enough

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560 
so that everybody definitely had enough
to<00:02:45.350> eat<00:02:45.530> well<00:02:46.250> that's<00:02:46.490> number<00:02:46.820> somewhere<00:02:47.300> safe

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
to eat well that's number somewhere safe

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.520 
to eat well that's number somewhere safe
to<00:02:47.600> live<00:02:48.020> um<00:02:48.880> had<00:02:49.880> access<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.480> clean<00:02:50.720> water<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
to live um had access to clean water and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
to live um had access to clean water and
just<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.280> basic<00:02:52.760> kind<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.090> biological<00:02:53.270> things

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
just the basic kind of biological things

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.810 
just the basic kind of biological things
any<00:02:54.170> animal<00:02:54.620> looks<00:02:54.830> for<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.700> was

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
any animal looks for what if that was

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.860 
any animal looks for what if that was
all<00:02:55.940> taken<00:02:56.120> care<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:57.460> how<00:02:58.460> much<00:02:58.670> work<00:02:59.450> do<00:02:59.810> you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
all taken care of how much work do you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.000 
all taken care of how much work do you
think<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.230> would<00:03:00.380> do<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.490> setting<00:03:03.010> what

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
think you would do in that setting what

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.140 
think you would do in that setting what
i<00:03:04.040> would<00:03:04.610> do<00:03:04.790> if<00:03:05.180> i<00:03:06.310> had<00:03:07.310> my<00:03:07.520> basic<00:03:07.850> survival

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
i would do if i had my basic survival

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.560 
i would do if i had my basic survival
needs<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.780> met<00:03:09.080> by<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> nature<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.890> whatever

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
needs just met by the nature of whatever

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.000 
needs just met by the nature of whatever
situation<00:03:11.570> we<00:03:12.050> were<00:03:12.200> on<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:12.650> alternate

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
situation we were on in this alternate

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.570 
situation we were on in this alternate
planet<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.520> wouldn't<00:03:14.480> do<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.840> much<00:03:15.380> stuff<00:03:16.190> I

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
planet I wouldn't do that much stuff I

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.370 
planet I wouldn't do that much stuff I
don't<00:03:17.300> think<00:03:17.480> I'd<00:03:17.570> work<00:03:17.780> more<00:03:18.020> than<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.200> few

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
don't think I'd work more than a few

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.370 
don't think I'd work more than a few
hours<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.709> day<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.370> anything<00:03:20.300> unless<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.290> was

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
hours a day on anything unless I was

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.380 
hours a day on anything unless I was
really<00:03:21.800> creatively<00:03:22.190> compelled<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.880> and

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
really creatively compelled to and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.940 
really creatively compelled to and
especially<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:23.990> lately<00:03:24.380> I've<00:03:24.560> been<00:03:24.890> feeling

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
especially just lately I've been feeling

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.100 
especially just lately I've been feeling
I<00:03:25.550> would<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:25.940> spend<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.810> lot<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:26.990> time

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
I would just spend a lot of time

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.449 
I would just spend a lot of time
sleeping<00:03:28.360> because<00:03:29.770> that's<00:03:30.770> what<00:03:30.890> comes<00:03:31.250> up

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
sleeping because that's what comes up

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.490 
sleeping because that's what comes up
and<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.150> don't<00:03:32.450> always<00:03:32.540> get<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.870> decide<00:03:33.200> how

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
and you don't always get to decide how

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.560 
and you don't always get to decide how
much<00:03:33.620> rest<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.130> feel<00:03:34.310> like<00:03:34.490> having<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.150> it's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
much rest you feel like having and it's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.720 
much rest you feel like having and it's
not<00:03:35.780> always<00:03:36.140> about<00:03:36.440> your<00:03:36.890> diet<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.459> how<00:03:37.580> much

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
not always about your diet and how much

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.190 
not always about your diet and how much
energy<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.209> have<00:03:38.300> from<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.840> food<00:03:39.020> you're

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
energy you have from the food you're

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.100 
energy you have from the food you're
eating<00:03:39.230> sometimes<00:03:39.980> there's<00:03:40.910> stuff<00:03:41.600> going<00:03:41.630> on

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
eating sometimes there's stuff going on

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.920 
eating sometimes there's stuff going on
that's<00:03:42.760> deeper<00:03:43.760> than<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.940> it's<00:03:44.360> not<00:03:44.510> purely

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
that's deeper than that it's not purely

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.320 
that's deeper than that it's not purely
biological<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.580> it's<00:03:46.700> really<00:03:46.880> important<00:03:47.300> to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
biological and it's really important to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.360 
biological and it's really important to
let<00:03:47.420> yourself<00:03:47.750> rest<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.350> my<00:03:48.860> point<00:03:49.040> with<00:03:49.250> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
let yourself rest and my point with the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.590 
let yourself rest and my point with the
alternate<00:03:49.790> planet<00:03:50.650> example<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:52.190> that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
alternate planet example is just that

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.910 
alternate planet example is just that
this<00:03:53.600> belief<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.350> we're<00:03:54.500> supposed<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.770> be

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
this belief that we're supposed to be

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.949 
this belief that we're supposed to be
productive<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.730> thinking<00:03:56.570> about<00:03:56.630> what<00:03:56.720> it's

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
productive and thinking about what it's

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.340 
productive and thinking about what it's
doing<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.590> all<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.700> time<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:59.600> think<00:04:00.230> it's

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
doing and just all the time I think it's

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.020 
doing and just all the time I think it's
artificial<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.400> not<00:04:01.610> really<00:04:02.000> our

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
artificial and it's not really our

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.420 
artificial and it's not really our
natural<00:04:02.660> state<00:04:02.840> because<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.770> mean<00:04:04.130> look<00:04:04.310> at

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
natural state because I mean look at

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.050 
natural state because I mean look at
your<00:04:04.610> cat<00:04:04.910> if<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.600> have<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.750> cat<00:04:06.080> how<00:04:06.920> much<00:04:07.100> does

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
your cat if you have a cat how much does

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.140 
your cat if you have a cat how much does
your<00:04:08.270> cat<00:04:08.480> actually<00:04:09.140> do<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:10.340> pretty<00:04:10.670> much<00:04:10.880> just

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
your cat actually do it pretty much just

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.199 
your cat actually do it pretty much just
bees<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.570> cap<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.290> sleeps<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.850> that's<00:04:13.970> kind<00:04:14.180> of

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
bees a cap and sleeps and that's kind of

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.390 
bees a cap and sleeps and that's kind of
its<00:04:14.360> main<00:04:14.570> deal<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:15.170> mean<00:04:15.739> if<00:04:15.860> you<00:04:15.950> look<00:04:16.100> at<00:04:16.250> any

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
its main deal I mean if you look at any

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.880 
its main deal I mean if you look at any
animal<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.180> its<00:04:17.390> habitat<00:04:18.350> they're<00:04:18.859> just

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
animal in its habitat they're just

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.340 
animal in its habitat they're just
chillin<00:04:19.760> unless<00:04:20.390> they<00:04:20.690> need<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.959> take<00:04:21.080> care<00:04:21.289> of

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
chillin unless they need to take care of

chillin unless they need to take care of
their<00:04:21.440> basic<00:04:21.830> survival<00:04:22.100> needs<00:04:22.310> obviously

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
their basic survival needs obviously

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.150 
their basic survival needs obviously
humans<00:04:23.630> aren't<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:24.229> like<00:04:24.470> any<00:04:24.710> other<00:04:24.800> animal

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
humans aren't just like any other animal

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.570 
humans aren't just like any other animal
because<00:04:25.700> we<00:04:25.910> have<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:27.130> different<00:04:28.130> plane<00:04:28.550> of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
because we have this different plane of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.490 
because we have this different plane of
consciousness<00:04:28.850> we're<00:04:29.479> able<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.930> reflect<00:04:30.320> on

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
consciousness we're able to reflect on

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.210 
consciousness we're able to reflect on
on<00:04:30.830> things<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.460> not<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.850> act<00:04:32.919> out<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.130> a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
on things and not just act out of a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.040 
on things and not just act out of a
stimulus<00:04:34.430> response<00:04:35.050> instinctual

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
stimulus response instinctual

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.840 
stimulus response instinctual
consciousness<00:04:36.800> um<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> think<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.850> it's

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
consciousness um so I think that it's

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.719 
consciousness um so I think that it's
natural<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.419> do<00:04:41.630> some<00:04:41.960> work<00:04:41.990> but<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.740> natural

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
natural to do some work but it's natural

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.890 
natural to do some work but it's natural
to<00:04:43.760> rest<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.240> lot<00:04:44.419> more<00:04:44.720> than<00:04:45.310> people<00:04:46.310> do<00:04:48.010> so

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
to rest a lot more than people do so

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.510 
to rest a lot more than people do so
ultimately<00:04:50.900> it's<00:04:51.169> an<00:04:51.320> individual<00:04:51.830> choice<00:04:52.130> how

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
ultimately it's an individual choice how

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.060 
ultimately it's an individual choice how
much<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:53.030> let<00:04:53.150> yourself<00:04:53.450> rest<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.110> my<00:04:54.800> big

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
much you let yourself rest and my big

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.480 
much you let yourself rest and my big
thing<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.729> this<00:04:55.880> video<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.300> just<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.500> don't

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
thing in this video is just that I don't

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.779 
thing in this video is just that I don't

worthless if you need to rest for

worthless if you need to rest for
whatever<00:05:05.720> reason<00:05:06.140> if<00:05:06.380> it's<00:05:06.530> if<00:05:07.280> you're<00:05:07.490> tired

relationship if you're just tired of
being<00:05:13.070> alive<00:05:16.930> sometimes<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:18.050> just<00:05:18.169> need<00:05:18.380> to

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
being alive sometimes you just need to

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.350 
being alive sometimes you just need to
lie<00:05:18.680> on<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:18.950> floor<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:21.430> bliss<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.700> or<00:05:23.030> lie<00:05:23.240> on

doing something wrong if they feel that
impulse<00:05:32.090> because<00:05:32.539> well<00:05:32.810> what<00:05:32.990> what<00:05:33.470> does<00:05:33.590> that

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
impulse because well what what does that

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.500 
impulse because well what what does that
produce<00:05:34.070> if<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:34.640> do<00:05:34.700> that<00:05:35.260> um<00:05:37.060> but<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.210> answer

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
produce if I do that um but the answer

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.500 
produce if I do that um but the answer
is<00:05:38.539> that<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.229> produces<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.800> happier<00:05:40.510> deeper

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
is that it produces a happier deeper

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.080 
is that it produces a happier deeper
version<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:41.990> you<00:05:42.140> that's<00:05:42.440> able<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:43.010> allow<00:05:43.640> more

version of you that's able to allow more
parts<00:05:44.479> of<00:05:44.600> yourself<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:45.890> expand<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:46.700> flourish

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
parts of yourself to expand and flourish

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.270 
parts of yourself to expand and flourish
including<00:05:47.660> your<00:05:47.840> natural<00:05:48.590> desire<00:05:49.039> that

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
including your natural desire that

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.870 
including your natural desire that
arises<00:05:50.020> periodically<00:05:51.020> for<00:05:51.350> rest<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.640> the

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
arises periodically for rest so the

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.240 
arises periodically for rest so the
bottom<00:05:53.030> line<00:05:53.210> is<00:05:53.419> i<00:05:53.960> encourage<00:05:54.770> you<00:05:54.830> to<00:05:54.950> rest

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
bottom line is i encourage you to rest

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.250 
bottom line is i encourage you to rest
when<00:05:55.550> you<00:05:55.669> need<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.120> maybe<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:57.050> means

when you need to and maybe that means

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.779 
when you need to and maybe that means
