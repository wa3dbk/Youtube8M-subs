00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.440
 good friends 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.530
 here they have 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.040
 what I have done with him 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.910
 with the chaste 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.520
 can not see good lack the part of 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 back is to support it well now well with 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.060
 zeal but good is what I have done 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.800
 we did a little free action this is 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.919
 will move away like this as they can 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 see here I have already sunk a little more 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.800
 screws 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.160
 to the city because I had to get away from 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.090
 here 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 because he played 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.180
 on the inside as you can see 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.180
 it's done a little but he loves 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.910
 to do a little test 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 and you 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.710
 it seems to me 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.770
 put it right here 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.770
 to be a better place 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.820
 because they can not see 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 the promise is to lower the state 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.009
 well open of holes as in had 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.009
 the shape 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 two 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.240
 the cream 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.240
 Soriano 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 we open 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.810
 if we go 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.810
 we also know 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.200
 this stayed very well so you know 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.110
 give is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.430
 Well, it's a bit dirty with this 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.240
 to be doing the retouching 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.240
 and the thing 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.080
 I'll show you some pictures of how 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.520
 I put in but I tell them that good 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520
 I made myself a little invention 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.760
 Wolves 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.130
 the screws 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.740
 if you see how I put them in the background 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.390
 they are as loose the mask can be 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.480
 disassemble easily as 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.140
 it was the most comfortable way if I did not have to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.900
 have done an incredible job but 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.900
 good for the first test 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.240
 for our friend who wanted to see already in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.460
 march and this also goes pa 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.220
 simple tips that I do not remember very well 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.190
 the name that said he had to 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.680
 crane how I was going to put it and so 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.620
 well you're done this is the test already 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 after a test with the position for 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.900
 see how it works you can see 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.930
 for missing clips 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.470
 touch up with putty sand the defects and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.720
 well I think it's already already happened already 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.720
 I almost believe that 3 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.810
 Y 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.749
 It seems to me that I thought I was never going 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.560
 to finish I was already black and 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:35.810
 I was not able to and also man 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.120
 we thank you 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.010
 well I hope that 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.240
 I think it 's thanks to everyone for 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.150
 have had patience 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.930
 and good and for having followed the thread that 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.670
 it's not over yet 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.670
 and missing to be the part 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.670
 of paint touches and 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.250
 and inside you can improve the texture 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.560
 you know I'll put a foam rubber because here 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.069
 when he plays here and they lose their lives 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.430
 I was throwing and well you're done and the others 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.360
 I have what I will do is simply that it 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.150
 assign the light step of doing it again 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.890
 this 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.100
 once fine but more than once 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.100
 no longer 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.230
 it seems to me 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.680
 had to perform here 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.810
 sanding to be able to 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.240
 as you see the dust is 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.990
 and sanding to adjust 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.360
 but well I think it was worth it 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.449
 very happy with the work I have done 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.280
 and thanks to the woman who helps me not 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.980
 so far no 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.639
 it's not here but hey here he's been 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.220
 with me until the last until recently 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:04.870
 testing and everything 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:08.530
 drunk what did you think was split 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.530
 to think that I was not going to achieve it 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.849
 Well nothing, thank you very much 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.449
 and I hope to continue 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:25.199
 here in the forum I will not continue showing 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.539
 how will those of the eyes be painted 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.699
 renting is a challenge that you know more about here 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.720
 in the retouching of the eyebrows so that 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.850
 see more eyes 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.850
 but well I think it's already 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.700
 it's already lined up thank you very much 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.810
 and if they have any 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.639
 any question or whatever you already know 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.340
 here in the forum 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.909
 this is the maximum that opens it does not open more 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.259
 good the journey to being to something else 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.440
 I had to comment 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:02.810
 these are servos 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.849
 the verbs you use are to be you 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.580
 analog I'm saying analog 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.950
 so what happens with being analog 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.490
 what 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.400
 that good 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.229
 they can not be programmed if there 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.139
 had so much trouble putting the 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.389
 hinges and nothing because of course being 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.950
 digital that would have been digital 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.710
 well 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.900
 You know, he marked the beginning and the end of 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.820
 be you and as much as I'm wrong that 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.650
 one above, one below 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.080
 same is that role I connect it to zero 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.240
 tester and I tell you now your tour has 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.000
 changed now it 's from this point this 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.130
 point but being analogical you can not 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.230
 do that or you have to do it 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.660
 you have to do it very perfect from the 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.660
 principle because otherwise it would not work 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.840
 Well, guys, I hope you have them 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.840
 liked my video 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.270
 the next video will be with the most 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.969
 details trying to improve those of the 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.610
 screws those of the chins and 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:12.120
 and good 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:16.020
 more thanks 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.020
 and you know 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.680
 to continue 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.270
 until the end until the end chau guys
