00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
Ice Cream Sandwich you actually have to

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.099 
Ice Cream Sandwich you actually have to
go<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.970> development<00:02:43.970> down<00:02:44.480> here<00:02:44.690> developer

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
go to development down here developer

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.869 
go to development down here developer
options<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:46.129> scroll<00:02:46.430> down<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.579> little<00:02:46.670> bit

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
options you scroll down a little bit

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.190 
options you scroll down a little bit
you'll<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.120> something<00:02:47.629> called<00:02:47.780> window

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
you'll see something called window

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.559 
you'll see something called window
animation<00:02:48.920> scale<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.849> you<00:02:50.000> actually<00:02:50.209> get<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
animation scale and you actually get a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.349 
animation scale and you actually get a
huge<00:02:50.930> range<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:51.769> we<00:02:51.859> go<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.010> 10x<00:02:52.519> things

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
huge range so if we go to 10x things

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.649 
huge range so if we go to 10x things
become<00:02:53.780> really<00:02:54.489> really<00:02:55.489> animated<00:02:56.329> but<00:02:56.480> if<00:02:56.569> you

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
become really really animated but if you

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.140 
become really really animated but if you
turn<00:02:56.810> them<00:02:56.930> off<00:02:57.639> what<00:02:58.639> you'll<00:02:58.760> notice<00:02:58.849> is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
turn them off what you'll notice is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.089 
turn them off what you'll notice is
things<00:02:59.420> become<00:02:59.750> more<00:02:59.900> instant<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.620> feels

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
things become more instant it feels

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.069 
things become more instant it feels
faster<00:03:01.730> when<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:01.970> turn<00:03:02.209> screen<00:03:02.569> animations

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
faster when you turn screen animations

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.809 
faster when you turn screen animations
off<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.470> course<00:03:03.980> you're<00:03:04.129> taking<00:03:04.430> away<00:03:04.549> some<00:03:04.790> of

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
off of course you're taking away some of

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.789 
off of course you're taking away some of
the<00:03:04.970> eye<00:03:05.000> candy<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:05.720> in<00:03:06.049> my<00:03:06.170> opinion<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.709> makes

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
the eye candy but in my opinion it makes

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.589 
the eye candy but in my opinion it makes
the<00:03:06.980> device<00:03:07.190> feel<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.579> lot<00:03:07.940> faster<00:03:08.389> when<00:03:08.510> you

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
the device feel a lot faster when you

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.449 
the device feel a lot faster when you
turn<00:03:08.810> off<00:03:08.959> screen<00:03:09.230> animations<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:10.280> there's

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
turn off screen animations then there's

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.670 
turn off screen animations then there's
another<00:03:10.549> item<00:03:11.030> here<00:03:11.269> transition<00:03:12.049> animation

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
another item here transition animation

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.680 
another item here transition animation
scale<00:03:12.709> can<00:03:13.579> turn<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.909> off<00:03:13.970> too<00:03:14.389> that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
scale can turn that off too that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.509 
scale can turn that off too that
determines<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> animation<00:03:16.280> when<00:03:16.400> you

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
determines the animation when you

well we've got two choices you can hit
the<00:04:48.400> X<00:04:48.580> here<00:04:48.880> or<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.510> can<00:04:49.630> just<00:04:49.780> swipe<00:04:50.050> them

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290

the X here or you can just swipe them
off<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.590> screen<00:04:50.710> very<00:04:51.280> intuitive<00:04:51.790> way<00:04:51.820> to

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
off the screen very intuitive way to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.540 
off the screen very intuitive way to
close<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.510> tabs<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:54.070> are<00:04:54.220> back<00:04:54.370> to

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
close the tabs and you are back to

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.770 
close the tabs and you are back to
square<00:04:54.730> one<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.240> course<00:04:55.419> if<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.570> close

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
square one and of course if you close

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.540 
square one and of course if you close
the<00:04:55.930> last<00:04:56.080> tab<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.620> thinks<00:04:57.070> you're<00:04:57.190> closing

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
the last tab it thinks you're closing

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.720 
the last tab it thinks you're closing
the<00:04:57.640> app<00:04:57.790> completely<00:04:58.150> along<00:04:59.140> those<00:04:59.350> lines<00:04:59.730> to

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
the app completely along those lines to

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.060 
the app completely along those lines to
exit<00:05:01.240> applications<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.230> is<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.440> very

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
exit applications and this is a very

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.890 
exit applications and this is a very
obvious<00:05:03.640> thing<00:05:03.669> of<00:05:04.060> ice<00:05:04.180> cream<00:05:04.390> sandwiches<00:05:04.750> an

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
obvious thing of ice cream sandwiches an

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.540 
obvious thing of ice cream sandwiches an
obvious<00:05:05.230> feature<00:05:05.410> so<00:05:06.040> of<00:05:06.100> course<00:05:06.310> we<00:05:06.400> have<00:05:06.490> the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
obvious feature so of course we have the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.150 
obvious feature so of course we have the
multitask<00:05:07.090> UI<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.720> did<00:05:08.290> you<00:05:08.410> know<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.620> turn

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
multitask UI and did you know to turn

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.980 
multitask UI and did you know to turn
off<00:05:09.400> applications<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.150> force<00:05:10.419> close<00:05:10.690> them<00:05:10.900> you

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
off applications to force close them you

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.810 
off applications to force close them you
can<00:05:11.110> actually<00:05:11.260> swipe<00:05:11.830> them<00:05:12.100> out<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.430> your<00:05:12.550> task

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
can actually swipe them out of your task

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.820 
can actually swipe them out of your task
list<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.780> if<00:05:13.870> you've<00:05:13.990> got<00:05:14.110> an<00:05:14.230> app<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.440> is

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
took me a long time to figure out where

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.070 
took me a long time to figure out where
the<00:05:30.729> phony<00:05:31.000> settings<00:05:31.419> were<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.600> use<00:05:31.870> Google

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
the phony settings were I use Google

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.320 
the phony settings were I use Google
Voice<00:05:32.260> so<00:05:33.070> when<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.250> set<00:05:33.520> up<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.700> new<00:05:33.820> phone<00:05:34.090> I

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
into phone settings it's a little bit

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.200 
into phone settings it's a little bit
hidden<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.310> out<00:05:51.430> of<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.640> way<00:05:51.760> but<00:05:51.970> it<00:05:52.060> kind<00:05:52.180> of

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
hidden and out of the way but it kind of

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.610 
hidden and out of the way but it kind of
makes<00:05:52.390> sense<00:05:52.450> actually<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.110> have<00:05:53.289> the<00:05:53.440> phone

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620
