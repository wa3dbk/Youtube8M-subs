record about 1 hours worth of video the
overall<00:04:29.010> impression<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.640> that<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.000> MDV<00:04:30.680> 450

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
overall impression is that the MDV 450

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.790 
overall impression is that the MDV 450
from<00:04:31.980> Swan<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.850> little<00:04:33.210> tricky<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.600> use<00:04:33.960> the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
from Swan is a little tricky to use the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.550 
from Swan is a little tricky to use the
wind<00:04:35.280> noise<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.760> picks<00:04:36.000> up<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.360> also<00:04:36.750> very<00:04:37.200> bad

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
wind noise it picks up is also very bad

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.290 
wind noise it picks up is also very bad
indeed<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.400> might<00:04:38.610> need<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> do<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.060> little

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
indeed so you might need to do a little

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.659 
indeed so you might need to do a little
bit<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.480> modification<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.950> cut<00:04:41.160> out<00:04:41.310> some<00:04:41.340> of

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
bit of modification to cut out some of

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.180 
bit of modification to cut out some of
that<00:04:41.730> wind<00:04:41.970> noise<00:04:42.090> but<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.110> image<00:04:43.530> quality<00:04:43.740> is

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
that wind noise but the image quality is

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.560 
that wind noise but the image quality is
very<00:04:44.220> good<00:04:44.850> indeed

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
very good indeed

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.050 
very good indeed
even<00:04:46.169> matches<00:04:46.590> up<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.919> much<00:04:47.100> higher<00:04:47.490> cost<00:04:47.880> in

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
even matches up to much higher cost in

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.210 
even matches up to much higher cost in
