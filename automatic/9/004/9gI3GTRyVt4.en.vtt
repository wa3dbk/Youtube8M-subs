00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.059
 they are all boys and welcome back to those 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 two on the server or we are on the corner of the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 monkey and today we will talk about one 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 particularly insistent monkey e 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 particularly sad if it is very sad 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 this monkey because we can't 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 definitely play this title either 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.869
 because it is a king title because we are 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 talking about one of the coolest sagas 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.530
 of the whole world of videogames is one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 saga from which we could 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.200
 draw really very little 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 because this is a damn title 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.719
 title that has always been exclusive to sony 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 and that only now is it also released 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.780
 for xbox but but is not released for 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.100
 the fucking pc no because it looks ugly with 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.050
 porting they thought no but what the fuck 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 make a porting for baby set 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.539
 losers let's use it for consoles and that's it 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.010
 we are talking about metal gear 5 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.950
 cursed cursed to you and cursed 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 what an epic fuck that game 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.740
 unfortunately we cannot play with it 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 what is tremendously about our balls 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.960
 for two reasons one because we are lost 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 lots of metal gear 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 I played the first gold in full 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.799
 finished several times I loved it or 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.720
 play hardware 3 to 4 but not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.220
 I have been 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.870
 they ended up playing at home 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.780
 my cousin may have popping 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.390
 unlocking I played the chapter 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.880
 better for psp than peace walker and it was 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.940
 fantastic that game above all a 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.120
 game that adapted well to the psp e 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.470
 this solid metal gear 5 that news more 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.170
 known the role there is the coolest thing that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 they could do it on this 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.670
 last chapter probably also for 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.380
 new console entry 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.330
 generation facilitate said vabbÃ¨ 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.390
 now we can pump a little more 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.960
 although it will obviously make it available for 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.880
 ps3 and xbox 360 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.670
 but they will probably catch a little 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.800
 hand on the new generation of 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.840
 open world console a guys 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.790
 headline like this open world 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.400
 I wouldn't have missed it for nothing at 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.709
 exact world so congratulations for not 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.810
 let crap out for PC 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.970
 well I'm also raised because of the trailer 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.370
 we have seen there is there was 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.990
 making to cry for the music for the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.850
 settings for the fact that you can 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.110
 riding for new actions 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.310
 stand what snake can do it 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.040
 characters there is the sniper that madonna 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.230
 how much my rava with the sniper is 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.090
 beautiful in short boys and it seems 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.870
 to be really 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.019
 title king and we can't play it but 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.200
 we can't play it more beautifully 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.310
 it is also the fact that there will be will be 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.349
 very dynamic the admission or the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.560
 emissions possibly because we could 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.269
 really decide to do it like 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.950
 we wish we could get around 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.980
 the obstacle that did not happen before 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.980
 because good or bad it was a bit like a tunnel 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.209
 will now be there were several steps but 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.610
 they were very very forced while while 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.120
 here no here no longer exists and road e 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.269
 in fact many many on the internet have 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.950
 fear pain that somehow can 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.410
 to be undermined this saga but where where 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.510
 metal gear solid and really guys don't 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.519
 a body is wrong almost never wrong 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.019
 wrong or in half of ascoli 2 because the 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.239
 settings was too equal 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.610
 to the other but fundamentally it always has 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.410
 made of young people and the difference of 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.750
 other sagas this is a saga that has 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.380
 always known to reinvent itself in a way 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.549
 consistent and above all fun 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.230
 adding new features that were 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.970
 always pussies like this 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.230
 billions to sony of five portacci 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.639
 monsters that made me go out for pc 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.910
 we have already said amy stampa yesterday 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.920
 we have already said it, however it should be done ok 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.510
 guys let us know if this is too 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.819
 your monkey if you are mine 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.880
 consular so you will take this game 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:11.340
 and let us know what the games are there 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.340
 like to fuck you more ok
