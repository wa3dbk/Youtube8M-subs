00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.020 

Bradford<00:01:09.140> hits<00:01:09.320> toes<00:01:09.530> every<00:01:09.740> game<00:01:10.280> at<00:01:10.820> least

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
Bradford hits toes every game at least

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.120 
Bradford hits toes every game at least
one<00:01:11.240> or<00:01:11.390> two<00:01:11.590> doesn't<00:01:12.590> usually<00:01:12.680> get<00:01:12.890> him<00:01:13.010> on

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
one or two doesn't usually get him on

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.060 
one or two doesn't usually get him on
target<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.080> he<00:01:15.080> came<00:01:15.350> through<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.800> he<00:01:15.890> needs

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
target but he came through and he needs

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.930
