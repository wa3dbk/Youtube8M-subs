00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.100 
beds and that way they've get lots of
water<00:01:32.979> but<00:01:33.399> it<00:01:33.520> also<00:01:33.700> drains<00:01:34.119> out<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.990> gets

the package says one for every six
inches<00:01:44.350> i<00:01:44.560> usually<00:01:44.890> do<00:01:45.039> two<00:01:45.280> or<00:01:45.520> three<00:01:45.880> for

making<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.179> too<00:02:01.450> strict<00:02:02.020> I'm<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:02.890> kind<00:02:03.130> of

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
making it too strict I'm just kind of

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.690 
making it too strict I'm just kind of
poking<00:02:03.609> them<00:02:03.789> into<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.179> ground<00:02:05.429> so<00:02:06.429> I'm<00:02:06.490> kind

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
poking them into the ground so I'm kind

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.760 
poking them into the ground so I'm kind
of<00:02:06.759> making<00:02:06.939> triangles<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.080> really<00:02:08.530> like

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
of making triangles I really like

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.450 
of making triangles I really like
triangles<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.050> poke<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.280> can

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
triangles so I just poke it in you can

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.370 
triangles so I just poke it in you can
make<00:02:12.610> good<00:02:12.640> trough<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.600> fill<00:02:13.900> them<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.200> as

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
make good trough and fill them in as

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.890 
make good trough and fill them in as
well<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:15.370> I've<00:02:15.520> just<00:02:15.700> found<00:02:15.940> by<00:02:16.240> just<00:02:16.450> poking

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
well but I've just found by just poking

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
well but I've just found by just poking
them<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.260> they<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:17.890> really<00:02:18.370> well<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:20.530> for

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
them in they do really well and one for

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.190 
them in they do really well and one for
every<00:02:21.220> six<00:02:21.599> inches<00:02:22.599> or<00:02:22.810> so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
every six inches or so

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.750 
every six inches or so
oh but<00:02:23.500> I'm<00:02:23.590> doing<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.920> little<00:02:24.099> more<00:02:24.340> than<00:02:24.550> that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
oh but I'm doing a little more than that

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.089 
oh but I'm doing a little more than that
a<00:02:25.090> lot<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.080> times<00:02:26.319> too<00:02:26.500> I'll<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:26.800> sprinkle

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
a lot of times too I'll just sprinkle

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.350 
a lot of times too I'll just sprinkle
some<00:02:28.080> throughout<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.379> bed<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.150> then<00:02:31.150> go

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
some throughout the bed and then go

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.110 
some throughout the bed and then go
through<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:33.280> separate<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:33.970> out<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
through and really separate it out a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.800 
through and really separate it out a
little<00:02:34.330> bit<00:02:34.450> more<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.090> also<00:02:40.300> an<00:02:40.599> easy

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
little bit more so this is also an easy

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.229 
little bit more so this is also an easy
way<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.110> do<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.550> kind<00:02:42.849> of<00:02:42.910> spread

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
way to do it is just to kind of spread

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.500 
way to do it is just to kind of spread
them<00:02:43.450> out<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.630> little<00:02:43.840> bit<00:02:44.730> knowing<00:02:45.730> again<00:02:46.209> not

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
them out a little bit knowing again not

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.210 
them out a little bit knowing again not
every<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.170> them<00:02:47.319> is<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.890> take<00:02:50.220> kind

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
every one of them is going to take kind

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:00.240 
every one of them is going to take kind
of<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:51.690> spread<00:02:52.690> them<00:02:52.810> out<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.860> can<00:02:59.920> poke

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
of just spread them out so I can poke

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.220 
of just spread them out so I can poke
them<00:03:00.459> into<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.819> ground<00:03:00.849> about<00:03:01.299> an<00:03:01.540> inch<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.170> I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
them into the ground about an inch but I

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.680 
them into the ground about an inch but I
found<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.680> really<00:03:03.040> easy<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.420> put<00:03:04.660> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
found it's really easy just to put a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.530 
found it's really easy just to put a
layer<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.560> about<00:03:05.980> an<00:03:06.160> inch<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.489> soil<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:07.090> top<00:03:07.120> of

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
layer of about an inch of soil on top of

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.650 
layer of about an inch of soil on top of
them<00:03:07.660> too<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.349> then<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.519> way<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.209> that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
them too and then that way I know that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.289 
them too and then that way I know that
they're<00:03:10.810> covered<00:03:11.170> up<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.790> they've<00:03:12.790> got<00:03:12.819> some

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
they're covered up and they've got some

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.270 
they're covered up and they've got some
really<00:03:13.329> nice<00:03:13.870> fresh<00:03:14.380> compost<00:03:16.860> now<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.920> soil

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
really nice fresh compost now the soil

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.039 
really nice fresh compost now the soil
is<00:03:18.489> nice<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.970> moist<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.569> I'm<00:03:19.660> not<00:03:19.780> going<00:03:19.989> to

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
is nice and moist so I'm not going to

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.680 
is nice and moist so I'm not going to
water<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.470> quite<00:03:20.920> yet<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:22.180> gets<00:03:22.390> warmer

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
water it quite yet as it gets warmer

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.870 
water it quite yet as it gets warmer
during<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.290> days<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> grounds<00:03:24.579> kind<00:03:24.819> of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
during the days and the grounds kind of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.910 
during the days and the grounds kind of
dries<00:03:25.120> out<00:03:25.360> I'm<00:03:25.989> going<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.230> water<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:26.650> by

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
dries out I'm going to water it just by

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.410 
dries out I'm going to water it just by
missing<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.819> I'm<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.269> keep

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
missing it and I'm going to keep

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.750 
missing it and I'm going to keep
checking<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.590> my<00:03:30.100> corn<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.549> going<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
checking on it and my corn is going to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.190 
checking on it and my corn is going to
come<00:03:30.970> up<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.269> it's<00:03:31.389> going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.600> do<00:03:31.780> really<00:03:32.019> well

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
come up and it's going to do really well

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.549 
come up and it's going to do really well
just<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.980> did<00:03:33.130> last<00:03:33.190> year
