00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.570
 and when youtube friends like it 's so 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.890
 good as promised is debt 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:19.010
 this 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:21.620
 Today, Sunday , May 10 and 8, is my last 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.170
 day with the stack motto 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:29.140
 and I finish my cycle today and last package 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.630
 this I voted for later 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.490
 well my experience goes up with this 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.070
 good supplement 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.400
 with this supplement 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.440
 I do not think I use it with a diet 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.330
 right because I'm doing a diet 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.660
 ketogenic is a ketogenic diet is 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.160
 eat pure higher percentage of popular 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.950
 in fat 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.110
 then proteins and almost nothing of 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.170
 carbohydrates you can only consume 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.640
 30 grams of carbohydrates a day in a 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.670
 ketogenic diet this I'm already 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.110
 using to define 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 I go very well with the ketogenic diet 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.010
 but I 've been week and I've come down 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.659
 9 body fat this goes up a kilo 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.920
 of muscle 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.659
 body fat if I'm going down a lot 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 I want to reach an 8 or a 10 percent 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.590
 and afterwards I'm going to put back 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.119
 carbohydrates 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.119
 well this supplement united 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.570
 so to reduce the percentage of fat 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.020
 bodily 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.100
 if you do not feel anything different 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.770
 in fact I removed as you can see that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.620
 come well then pills the red 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 it's caffeine but I take it in the pac 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.280
 he always took it off because 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.530
 in the ketogenic diet can not be this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.350
 consume caffeine so they do not fire 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.409
 insulin in the body but shorten the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.140
 Ketosis ok and if I can recommend it 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.570
 well the truth 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.790
 and I could not tell you why 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.580
 I am a kilo of lean muscle mass 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.200
 with the kilo and a half more or less but not 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.200
 I really know if I owe the hormonal pro 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.820
 or my diet was left because it consumed 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.040
 a lot of protein a day consume 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.480
 approximately 250 grams when I continue 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.959
 consuming paying the term 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.150
 with about 250 grams of protein and more 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.019
 apart as another 200 of fat then 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.409
 yes it is quite and it is enough food 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.909
 what I have done to date but it is very 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.420
 good for the percentage of fat 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.700
 bodily 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.489
 this 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.080
 What can I say? I think in some 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.060
 three more weeks that I finish my diet 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.580
 ketogenic I will do nostra in 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.680
 reality 40 days more 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.010
 I'm going to do it until they reach my 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.660
 goal of 8 percent of the body and 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 I'm going to start putting carbohydrates but 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.890
 moderate or I will kill the cats 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.880
 before training and then nothing else 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.769
 I'm getting little by little because I get 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 nutritionists with which I go in this me 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.680
 they said that the diet is fine 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.480
 Ketogenic helps reduce fat 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.340
 body but when you put him 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.260
 carbohydrates you have to give the effect 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.720
 bounce then he told me that I think that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 I have to put them from space 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.340
 before training and after 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.180
 well that's all about the subject stuck in 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.760
 summary if I recommend it if your diet 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.099
 it's a volume that you consume that orchards and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 I recommend it but if you do a diet 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.870
 for definition is not not convenient 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.239
 for you to define me helped me 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.519
 is helping to define but really 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.980
 I wanted to gain weight has created metro 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.379
 volume this if in volume if you 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.659
 I recommend it in good definition 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.890
 Now I am with another supplement that 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:54.799
 that as propitious mind and is the mazda5 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.739
 magnesium and vitamin b6 this say that 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.129
 help to increase testosterone 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.549
 improve the dream this yesterday I took it and 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.400
 I slept then when brothers I can not 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.420
 say that it had turned out not in a day 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.730
 testing is free I'll like it 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.560
 tell the experiences with him with the 7 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.900
 m 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.859
 and with my pure champion protein and its 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.560
 zero because it is very good 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.039
 in relation quality-price is very very 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.400
 well the truth and well I feel more 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.160
 this 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.350
 what else can you say I think it's all for 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.870
 right now 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.680
 and they continue to train hard eating 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.140
 ok and you can talk between files and 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.590
 eat healthy to achieve 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.590
 the meters
