00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.900
 they had to turn around 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.240
 It puts you in the right place 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.130
 over the river 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.450
 out and you do not need to jump 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.910
 so strong and without any kind of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.620
 problems and this is missing a bit to see 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.020

 thing as are some little things 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.180
 ramps there that you do not have to catch but 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.240
 I was expecting something a little more 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.910
 tolerant worth eye 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.590
 when it happens that this one that has close 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.250
 we're going backwards so we do not have to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.430
 turn around 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 Nicaragua now does not want to leave the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.500
 park lady of the beginning of truth 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.659

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.610
 I have there very well high that was what 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.409
 this section is costing me government 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.079
 we have what we have we have quiet 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.310

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.530

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.129

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.659
 metro read today did not give the melody to 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.970
 see the goal to see what is not always for 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.230
 see the goal because I do not trust a hair will 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.599
 we turn around here 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.599
 here we have a zig zag container 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.250
 all right 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.650
 I can believe it, I can not and I can not 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.940
 the point was all calculated 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.940
 for not being able to catch the boy 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.250
 that is in front 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.940
 Boys 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.430
 the same minute trap the trap of 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.360
 6 checkpoints are missing guys 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.360
 I feel like you want to win 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.110
 we will make perfect stop but written 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:49.929
 also assaults perfect male I do not know 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.580
 provided that hopefully there 's another whopper and 

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:52.929
 in front of me, I am that crazy man who made him 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.330
 I exploded the car in my face and I won 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:57.330
 nothing pleases you to win 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.889
 the radio has won because of the trolley or 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.969
 those keys and brushed the bars that 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.889
 they exploit the car in the primer that 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.150
 I start with this principle 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.289
 possibly going to walk in 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.629
 a lot to say that it was not the house showed 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.009
 finally controls and especially in 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.060
 subscribe to the casino lots and see you 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:43.660

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:43.660
