00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 my name is bear and mayer pineda am 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.490
 agronomic engineering student 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.360
 We are studying the subject of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 phytopathology this time I'm going to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.020
 talk about an organic fungicide 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.920
 which is based on papaya leaves 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.750
 These are the quantities of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 which we are going to apply these materials 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.790
 are 3 pounds of papaya leaves this one 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.090
 stalk output 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.860
 this one pound a pound of lime 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 is the sheets of paper 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.180
 we crush them 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 we can liquefy if desired or just the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 we crush and put them in a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.379
 We put them in a container 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.750
 with a liter or a liter and a half of water 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.750
 the aloe we can fix it in pieces 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:10.600
 so that it is a greater concentration the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.780
 we also apply in the container that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 it stops to put it associate 30 minutes 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.770
 we add the lime 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.299
 we add the lime this we leave 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.010
 cook for 30 minutes which will have 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.820
 to be simmering 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.790
 we let it sit all day and the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.980
 next day we can pack it or 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.260
 apply already either here I already have a 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.970
 fungicide and has prepared which 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.830
 we can apply two two candle glasses 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.150
 this for a 20-liter pump 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.150
 we can apply it 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.230
 this advertising serves us as a 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.500
 preventive in front of the fungi 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.430
 It can also be like a repellent 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.310
 also this what does what the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.610
 aloe and the sheets of paper is that the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.080
 the scars of let's say when we can 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.810
 the plants this one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.410
 that comes out faster is the effect of the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.370
 blood and lime this what it does is that 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.100
 they are not, do not bring it in wounds 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.950
 of the plants because they 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.110
 Interested in entering the plant but the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.620
 warm protects her so that they heal 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.159
 faster wound 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.480
 We can apply this happiness to 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.480
 all different crops
