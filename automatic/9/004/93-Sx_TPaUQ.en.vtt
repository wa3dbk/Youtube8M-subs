00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:16.102
 Hello ! From Saint-Malo we took the Petit Corsaire 

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.084
 the boat we're currently on and we're going 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.110
 to Dinard 

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.733
 we landed at Dinard and we are on the moonlit promenade 

00:00:55.977 --> 00:01:00.077
 Dinard, the name comes from the Celtic din, the hill, and arz, the bear 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.179
 who represents Kingship, King Arthur and so we are 

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:06.205
 on the hill of King Arthur 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.399
 Dinard is a small fishing port until the middle of the 19th century 

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:44.271
 time English families fall in love with these places 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.150
 fall in love with this city, and soon it's all the aristocracy 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.230
 European and elsewhere who will meet in Dinard 

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.813
 of its heyday, Dinard retains an exceptional heritage 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.889
 at the level of architecture with its villas along the coast of Dinard 

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:04.417
 They are very different from each other and it is they 

00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:09.607
 which today allow Dinard to have the label City of Art and History
