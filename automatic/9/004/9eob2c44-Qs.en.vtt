 from this device it supports power 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.830

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.090
 acts of any but not any but in certain 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.950
 the driver may not exit the vehicle 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 means but but at the same time according 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.970
 of article 200 608 he is entitled 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.920
 read the testimony of the device well 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.370
 can you please commit all such 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.190
 actions

 disconnect 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.300

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.350
 battery can't connect battery 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.670
 because he goes on the wire drink but 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.810
 he should be given what you have 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.970
 when wrong stand i know the battery 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.740
 the opinion of them is not a problem hard here 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.300
 same bus is not the point just me 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.600
 the law has the right to be his 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.640
 vehicle 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.250
 well see if you think that i am 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.440
 broke let's go there i believe you that you 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.120
 say so better inspector delivered 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.840
 I have no reason to trust him 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.560
 let's create a protocol I'm in 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.190
 appropriate dates build it 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.040
 appeal naturally as I'm broke 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.900
 must drink one from to responsibility 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.340
 I'll tell you so when the inspector 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.140
 found ready to go 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.600
 take away the monsters that need to 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.620
 the production 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 Your room number is 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.569
 you can not clearly see you 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.159
 they will take it to us 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:07.810
 composition i mean i don't have this video 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.810
 you do not have a clear video 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.400
 act speed you know but may 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.079
 be I will not deny 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.109
 you know maybe i won't deny 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:26.500
 let's make up right away and there already 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:28.330
 court decision well, see this 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.000
 This side of the coin is different, that is, if 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.800
 here anyway there is someone to blame for 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.900
 This situation, that is, if I violated 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.070
 must bear answers if i am but 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.039
 if if friends have no clear much 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.180
 installation reasonably well without reason he 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.990
 not stopped if you do not have clear 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.150
 proving i mean you must 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.259
 match appropriate with 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.639
 Ukrainian legislation 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.470
 always stop me for some 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.860
 the reason that is you fixed 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.199
 speed violation clearly stopped 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:03.690
 drew up a protocol but if I do not deny 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:03.690
 what I broke then you can make up why 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.180
 well from according to 200 to write 2 articles with 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.340
 special stopariku nadia inspector you 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.620
 know what 200 c 1 to goat odessa 2 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.630
 remember if the inspector is completely sure 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.639
 clearly know that the driver violated something 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.289
 nothing interferes then i can that 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.289
 I say wrong or it seems so 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.640
 consonants punishing well let's me 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.270
 no problems were very nice 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.520
 to talk 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.990
 i just get to know you more i 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.690
 I do not know you can not certify 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.180
 look and everything i will go further i think 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:49.290
 that yes I wanted to read the potroshenko 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:52.100
 Sergey Anatolievich 2000 Plant 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.850
 escorted collar 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.850
 model of scriabin 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.460
 You have inspector Vavrynyuk was so have him 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:05.860
 two zeros 602 in my opinion was to lose 3 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:09.790
 days up is also possible the closer to shiva and 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.949
 Alexander Leonovich to 14 is very nice 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.260
 had a chat with you thanks machine 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:19.449
 It became so it seemed to cover exactly 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:21.250
 meetings I think well I don't even know 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.810

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.080

 reasonably well, it was nice to appropriate 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.910
 honestly hard i'm just going myself 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.570
 maybe it is not visible because of the fact that 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.170
 the time of day was not allowed so why 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:07:00.020
 a bit lacked 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:01.370
