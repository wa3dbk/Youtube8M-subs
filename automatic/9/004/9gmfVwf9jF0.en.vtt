00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 very good all to a new video a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.639
 informative video if you remember in 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.840
 2009 there was the 9th district movie with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.179
 very good score 18 out of 10 that very 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.660
 good and good I bring you this news that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.250
 it looks like it has announced to me district 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.250
 10 the continuation of the movie 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.980
 directed by neill blomkamp vale 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.290
 then good 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.510
 they have already made the sketches concretely 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.400
 18 pages of sketches 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.489
 storyboards but they say they do not want 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.500
 affirm or confirm that the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.030
 movie that is for the moment good to be 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.710
 doing little pictures are doing a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.070
 little bit of sketches to see how you can 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.110
 stay but good movie is not there two 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.610
 options can not do it or if they go 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.829
 to do then why they want to leave 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 a time a margin to decide what 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.910
 do but good 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.320
 it looks like it looks like I think so 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.290
 what they are going to do is a product because 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.300
 that has a lot of money and the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.909
 director also has a lot of money like that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.969
 what 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.969
 district 10 I think I could get there 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.659
 2015 end of 2015 2010 and 2016 not me 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.759
 I think it 's 2015 if it were done now it's 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.030
 if they confirm it now for the moment so 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.820
 what he puts here 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.190
 blue rodeo blue cam assured that of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.170
 moment can not commit to the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.000
 sequel then 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.979
 I do not want to commit because he says that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.259
 can go for long so good that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.899
 like 2015-2016 more or less if it 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.460
 will confirm if it is not confirmed by nothing 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.580
 there is but in principle you continue to sneak 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.100
 so all the people who liked 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.140
 different 9 will have to wait a lot 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.720
 more but good is good news for 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.509
 which could be that there was another 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.009
 part of the movie and nothing guys I leave you 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.479
 the link the information and as I say 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.649
 We always see each other in upcoming videos 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.649
 Thank you so much, goodbye
