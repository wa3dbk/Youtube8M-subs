00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
relationship because a lot of budgets

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.660

would<00:01:08.650> love<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.920> get<00:01:09.010> they<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.340> get<00:01:09.460> along

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
would love to get they that get along

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.510 
would love to get they that get along
really<00:01:09.850> well<00:01:09.970> but<00:01:10.450> these<00:01:11.440> two<00:01:11.710> they<00:01:11.860> seem<00:01:12.220> to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
really well but these two they seem to

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.270 
really well but these two they seem to
do<00:01:12.790> more<00:01:13.540> fighting<00:01:13.960> than<00:01:13.990> anything<00:01:14.440> else<00:01:14.890> but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
do more fighting than anything else but

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.770 
do more fighting than anything else but
I<00:01:15.340> think<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.820> they<00:01:15.940> secretly<00:01:16.360> love<00:01:16.630> each

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
I think that they secretly love each

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.450 
I think that they secretly love each
other<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.840> Bluebird<00:01:20.710> always<00:01:20.980> lets<00:01:21.190> green

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
other so and Bluebird always lets green

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.190 
other so and Bluebird always lets green
bird<00:01:21.670> eat<00:01:21.850> first<00:01:22.090> because<00:01:22.420> Greenberg<00:01:23.050> will

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
bird eat first because Greenberg will

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.980 
bird eat first because Greenberg will
Peck<00:01:23.440> Bluebird<00:01:23.950> on<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.310> head<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:24.990> Bluebird

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
still pretty shy we adopted these guys

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.399 
still pretty shy we adopted these guys
we<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.259> their

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we don't really know what their

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649 
we don't really know what their
situation<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:01.950> before<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.850> adopted<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.420> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
situation was before we adopted them but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.050 
situation was before we adopted them but
they're<00:02:03.869> pretty<00:02:04.080> friendly<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
they're pretty friendly so we think that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.100 
they're pretty friendly so we think that
they<00:02:06.420> were<00:02:07.080> with<00:02:07.289> an<00:02:07.470> owner<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:09.110> didn't

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
they were with an owner that didn't

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.900 
they were with an owner that didn't
abuse<00:02:10.380> them<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.830> didn't<00:02:11.220> necessarily<00:02:11.340> love

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
abuse them but didn't necessarily love

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.390 
abuse them but didn't necessarily love
them<00:02:12.180> too<00:02:12.300> much<00:02:12.420> either<00:02:13.069> they<00:02:14.069> don't<00:02:14.220> they
