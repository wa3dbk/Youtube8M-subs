jaggedness<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.960> NS<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.100> fact<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> was

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
jaggedness of NS to the fact that it was

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.190 
jaggedness of NS to the fact that it was
in<00:01:41.729> indiana<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> atmospheric<00:01:43.020> sun

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
in indiana look at the atmospheric sun

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.279 
in indiana look at the atmospheric sun
visors<00:01:43.649> flash<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.820> yep<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.359> jaggedness<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
visors flash up yep the jaggedness is

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.469 
visors flash up yep the jaggedness is
gone<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.859> anti-aliasing<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
gone because anti-aliasing is in and it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
gone because anti-aliasing is in and it
is<00:01:48.570> looking<00:01:48.960> decidedly<00:01:49.409> triple-a<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
is looking decidedly triple-a at the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
is looking decidedly triple-a at the
moment<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:51.810> let's<00:01:52.079> look<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> couple<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
moment now let's look at a couple of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.080 
moment now let's look at a couple of
specific<00:01:53.579> little<00:01:54.509> changes<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.229> build<00:01:55.560> 18

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
specific little changes in build 18

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.980 
specific little changes in build 18
signing<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.240> fact<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
signing with the fact that you now get a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.779 
signing with the fact that you now get a
nice<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.350> orange<00:01:58.799> blood<00:01:59.219> splatter<00:01:59.609> when

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
nice little orange blood splatter when

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.099 
nice little orange blood splatter when
you<00:01:59.909> shoot<00:02:00.179> aliens<00:02:00.570> making<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.929> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.079> easier

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
you shoot aliens making it a lot easier

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.639 
you shoot aliens making it a lot easier
to<00:02:01.439> tell<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.939> hit<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.479> sprinting<00:02:04.140> no

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
to tell when you hit them sprinting no

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.469 
to tell when you hit them sprinting no
longer<00:02:05.009> interrupts<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.119> sprint

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
longer interrupts things so I can sprint

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.509 
longer interrupts things so I can sprint
and<00:02:06.719> reload<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> same<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
and reload at the same time and it

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.309 
and reload at the same time and it
basically<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.269> works<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.170> all

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
basically it works like that for all

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.490 
basically it works like that for all
things<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:12.060> flamethrower<00:02:12.810> chick

these<00:02:13.650> effects<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.580> now<00:02:14.760> set

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
these effects out it can now set

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.050 
these effects out it can now set

changes to the map on summit are the the
ramp<00:02:49.440> from<00:02:49.680> pipe<00:02:49.950> junction<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.610> into<00:02:50.820> data

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
ramp from pipe junction up into data

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120 
ramp from pipe junction up into data
core<00:02:51.209> used<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> massive<00:02:52.170> bottleneck<00:02:52.800> was

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
core used to be a massive bottleneck was

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.070 
core used to be a massive bottleneck was
sometimes<00:02:53.760> not<00:02:54.030> enjoyable<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.720> usually

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
sometimes not enjoyable and usually

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.420 
sometimes not enjoyable and usually
turned<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.440> grenade<00:02:55.709> spam<00:02:55.950> there's<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.400> a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
turned it a grenade spam there's now a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.760 
turned it a grenade spam there's now a
staircase<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.290> allows<00:02:58.560> you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
staircase to the right that allows you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.800 
staircase to the right that allows you
to<00:02:58.800> bypass<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.520> ramp<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.600> very

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to bypass that ramp and that is very

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.140 
to bypass that ramp and that is very
important<00:03:01.320> for<00:03:01.739> gameplay<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.489> summit<00:03:02.940> that'll

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
important for gameplay on summit that'll

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.330 
important for gameplay on summit that'll
really<00:03:03.510> improve<00:03:03.930> things<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.350> heliport<00:03:05.070> I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
really improve things and heliport I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
really improve things and heliport I
don't<00:03:05.850> even<00:03:05.910> know<00:03:06.090> what<00:03:06.180> heliports<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
don't even know what heliports going to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.610 
don't even know what heliports going to
be<00:03:06.959> cold<00:03:07.530> anymore<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.350> just

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
be cold anymore but it is it is just

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.430 
be cold anymore but it is it is just
completely<00:03:11.390> changed<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.989> don't<00:03:13.350> know

remember but the lights still go out

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.600 
remember but the lights still go out
looking<00:06:14.800> even<00:06:15.130> better<00:06:15.160> with<00:06:15.520> the

atmospherics in the background and then

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.170 
atmospherics in the background and then

when the lights are out the buildings
are<00:06:19.270> unpowered<00:06:19.570> so<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:19.960> armory<00:06:20.410> there<00:06:20.590> is

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
are unpowered so that armory there is

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.730 
are unpowered so that armory there is
unpowered<00:06:21.070> it<00:06:21.280> will<00:06:21.490> sit<00:06:21.700> on<00:06:21.730> 0%<00:06:22.630> once<00:06:23.440> that

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.890 
unpowered it will sit on 0% once that
happens<00:06:24.190> you<00:06:24.280> don't<00:06:24.550> have<00:06:24.850> to<00:06:25.000> rebuild<00:06:25.540> you

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
happens you don't have to rebuild you

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.330 
happens you don't have to rebuild you
don't<00:06:26.050> have<00:06:26.169> to<00:06:26.290> select<00:06:26.590> to<00:06:26.800> build<00:06:27.010> a<00:06:27.130> power

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
don't have to select to build a power

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.950 
don't have to select to build a power
node<00:06:27.520> again<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:27.910> just<00:06:27.940> have<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.419> repair<00:06:28.780> that

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
node again you just have to repair that

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.050 
node again you just have to repair that
existing<00:06:29.440> power<00:06:29.650> node<00:06:29.890> so<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:30.400> goes<00:06:30.580> back<00:06:30.880> to

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
existing power node so it goes back to

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.670 
existing power node so it goes back to
normal<00:06:31.419> so<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:31.930> thing<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.200> take<00:06:32.350> away<00:06:32.410> is

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
normal so the thing to take away is

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.040 
normal so the thing to take away is
power<00:06:33.010> mode<00:06:33.250> still<00:06:33.580> work<00:06:33.850> the<00:06:34.090> same<00:06:34.300> way

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
power mode still work the same way

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.200 
power mode still work the same way
once<00:06:35.229> you've<00:06:35.470> built<00:06:35.740> one<00:06:36.039> on<00:06:36.250> an<00:06:36.370> empty<00:06:36.520> socket

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
once you've built one on an empty socket

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.939 
once you've built one on an empty socket
but<00:06:37.389> instead<00:06:37.659> of<00:06:37.810> starting<00:06:38.289> with<00:06:38.440> power<00:06:38.710> nodes

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
but instead of starting with power nodes

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.770 
but instead of starting with power nodes
everywhere<00:06:39.340> you<00:06:39.669> start<00:06:40.000> with<00:06:40.150> sockets

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
everywhere you start with sockets

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.290 
everywhere you start with sockets
everywhere<00:06:41.229> so<00:06:41.889> that's<00:06:42.430> the<00:06:42.729> change-up<00:06:42.909> and

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
everywhere so that's the change-up and

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.270 
everywhere so that's the change-up and
that's<00:06:43.509> what<00:06:43.900> that's<00:06:44.560> is<00:06:44.860> what<00:06:45.069> you<00:06:45.220> should

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
that's what that's is what you should

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.520 
that's what that's is what you should
take<00:06:45.550> away<00:06:45.789> from<00:06:46.000> that<00:06:46.270> that's<00:06:46.990> a<00:06:47.110> fairly<00:06:47.349> big

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
take away from that that's a fairly big

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.379 
take away from that that's a fairly big
gameplay<00:06:48.009> change<00:06:48.310> and<00:06:48.520> when<00:06:48.669> the<00:06:48.819> power<00:06:49.180> node

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
gameplay change and when the power node

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.420 
gameplay change and when the power node
is<00:06:49.509> back<00:06:49.690> up<00:06:49.900> and<00:06:50.020> repaired<00:06:50.409> it'll<00:06:50.919> have<00:06:51.400> a

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
is back up and repaired it'll have a

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.550 
is back up and repaired it'll have a
nice<00:06:51.759> little<00:06:52.000> effect<00:06:52.509> it'll<00:06:52.780> spherical

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
nice little effect it'll spherical

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.990 
nice little effect it'll spherical
effect<00:06:53.889> that<00:06:54.039> tells<00:06:54.250> you<00:06:54.340> what<00:06:54.460> is<00:06:54.550> powering

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
effect that tells you what is powering

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.110 
effect that tells you what is powering
the<00:06:55.210> buildings<00:06:55.720> in<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.620> room<00:06:56.979> now<00:06:57.699> that's<00:06:57.879> all
