00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
had a blast for one it was I don't think

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.310 
had a blast for one it was I don't think
it<00:00:50.300> was<00:00:50.420> harder<00:00:50.780> than<00:00:50.810> I<00:00:51.020> thought<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.200> was

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
it was harder than I thought it was

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.660 
it was harder than I thought it was
going<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.500> be<00:00:51.620> because<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.920> thought<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.579> was

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
going to be because I thought it was

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.729 
going to be because I thought it was
going<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.880> be<00:00:53.060> hard<00:00:53.960> for<00:00:54.350> sure<00:00:54.380> but<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.989> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
going to be hard for sure but the I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.350 
going to be hard for sure but the I
think<00:00:58.220> when<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.489> when<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.700> actually<00:00:58.940> show<00:00:59.329> up

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
think when you when you actually show up

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.660 
think when you when you actually show up
with<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.660> events<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.320> realize<00:01:00.739> kind<00:01:01.579> of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
with the events and you realize kind of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.119 
with the events and you realize kind of
how<00:01:01.790> little<00:01:02.149> time<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.360> have<00:01:02.630> to<00:01:03.129> get

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
how little time you have to get

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.950 
how little time you have to get
everything<00:01:04.369> under<00:01:04.729> control<00:01:04.850> coming<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.719> a<00:01:05.750> new

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960
