the<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.770> score<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.480> all

the for the score that is now we all
know<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> probably<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.530> swarm<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> dogs

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
know that probably the swarm of the dogs

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
know that probably the swarm of the dogs
are<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.030> best<00:01:06.060> kill<00:01:06.600> streaks<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> best

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

are the best kill streaks are the best
score<00:01:08.130> streaks<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.790> those<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.420> high<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
score streaks but those are so high and

like<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.479> said<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> best<00:01:40.229> bang<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.619> your

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
like I said it's the best bang for your

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.260 
like I said it's the best bang for your
buck<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.400> guess<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.000> trying<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
buck I guess that's what I'm trying to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.230 
buck I guess that's what I'm trying to
get<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.079> i<00:01:43.380> got<00:01:43.890> i<00:01:44.040> believe<00:01:44.280> 12<00:01:44.610> kills<00:01:44.880> with

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
get it so i got i believe 12 kills with

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
get it so i got i believe 12 kills with
the<00:01:45.329> lodestar<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.899> gameplay<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.070> was

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the lodestar this gameplay and it was

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649 
the lodestar this gameplay and it was
the<00:01:47.250> first<00:01:47.430> time<00:01:47.579> i<00:01:47.640> ever<00:01:47.850> use<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> kill<00:01:48.570> streak

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the first time i ever use a kill streak

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
the first time i ever use a kill streak
I<00:01:48.869> mean<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.439> similar<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> Reaper

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I mean it's very similar to the Reaper

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.740 
I mean it's very similar to the Reaper
to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> Reaper<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.060> mon<00:01:51.180> amour<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> three

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to the Reaper for mon amour for a three

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
to the Reaper for mon amour for a three
but<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.530> also<00:01:52.829> kind<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.399> different<00:01:53.759> because

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
but it is also kind of different because

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.109 
but it is also kind of different because
um<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:55.170> mean<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> feel<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> aims

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
um I mean it feel like it aims

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
um I mean it feel like it aims
differently<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
differently it's kind of different to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.399 
differently it's kind of different to
aim<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> guys<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.240> seen<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.840> as

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
aim but as you guys are seen here I'm as

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.749 
aim but as you guys are seen here I'm as
you<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.159> hard<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.490> used<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you see it's kind of hard to get used to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.760 
you see it's kind of hard to get used to
at<00:02:02.880> first<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.290> guys<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
at first but as you guys are going to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.380 
at first but as you guys are going to
see<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.130> bit<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> start<00:02:06.210> going

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979

off like midway through this kill streak
now<00:02:08.190> those<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.720> what<00:02:10.259> makes<00:02:10.470> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
now those you don't know what makes this

now those you don't know what makes this

the on the missiles when they hit the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.270 
the on the missiles when they hit the
ground<00:02:32.219> is<00:02:32.609> it<00:02:33.299> seems<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.019> be<00:02:34.049> nearly<00:02:34.709> double

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
ground is it seems to be nearly double

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.069 
ground is it seems to be nearly double
of<00:02:35.400> what<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.670> was<00:02:35.909> in<00:02:36.150> modern<00:02:36.389> warfare<00:02:36.420> 3<00:02:36.659> and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
of what it was in modern warfare 3 and

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.679 
of what it was in modern warfare 3 and
if<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.650> guys<00:02:37.799> can<00:02:37.980> also<00:02:38.129> see<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.269> bull<00:02:39.480> or

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
if you guys can also see the the bull or

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.879 
if you guys can also see the the bull or
the<00:02:39.840> missiles<00:02:40.169> seem<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.469> shoot<00:02:40.680> down

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
the missiles seem to shoot down

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.300 
the missiles seem to shoot down
literally<00:02:41.639> twice<00:02:42.060> as<00:02:42.299> fast<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.709> also<00:02:44.010> on

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
literally twice as fast so and also on

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.429 
literally twice as fast so and also on
top<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.879> I<00:02:45.090> feel<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.719> this<00:02:45.989> has<00:02:46.169> at

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
top of that I feel like this has at

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.039 
top of that I feel like this has at
least<00:02:46.889> one<00:02:47.069> more<00:02:47.579> Flair<00:02:48.000> than<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.569> Reaper<00:02:48.900> did

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
least one more Flair than the Reaper did

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.229 
least one more Flair than the Reaper did
modern<00:02:49.319> warfare<00:02:49.469> 3<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.280> overall<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:51.030> is

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
modern warfare 3 so overall this is

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.599 
modern warfare 3 so overall this is
literally<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.689> reaper<00:02:52.290> completely<00:02:53.040> revamped

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
literally a reaper completely revamped

literally a reaper completely revamped
and<00:02:53.939> ten<00:02:54.569> times<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.260> good<00:02:55.829> as<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.489> Reaper<00:02:56.760> in

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
and ten times as good as the Reaper in
