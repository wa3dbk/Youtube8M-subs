00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.560
 this is sinbad raised in captivity 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.840
 representative super feline not lion and not 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.360
 tiger liger weighing 408 kilograms 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.439
 Sinbad is almost 100 times more than home 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.080
 cats and twice as heavy as a lion or 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.880
 tetra 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.340
 Dr. Bhagavan and a raised sinbad 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 this bengal tiger weighs 226 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.550
 kilograms 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.680
 his adult male has a big head 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.280
 wide bones but he seems like a dwarf 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.079
 next to this huge whether its a gram 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 the head is bastet twice the head 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 Bengal tiger between the crown of the nose 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.440
 so much distance what happens 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.989
 huge construction width of these 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.449
 huge jaws and wide bones makes 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.730
 his serious opponent is good 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.730
 boy this leader is artificially bred 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.960
 in the wild they do not exist 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.940
 the result of crossing a lion and a tigress 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.210
 the result was an incredibly large 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.540
 hybrid 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.690
 in size and weight of the parent the game looks 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.619
 next to him dwarfs are just massive 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.869
 skull ligro 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.190
 40 percent more lego skull or 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.090
 tiger they have massive wide bones and 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:31.890
 they are huge sized walls of a lion together 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.649
 taken scientists are trying to understand why 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 hybrids like ligro so far 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.330
 more than their parents already know what 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.820
 ligers lack a gene that inhibits growth 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.369
 thanks to which they could be 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.920
 regular size they only live in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.509
 captivity but the degree of development of their body is not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.509
 unmatched in drive 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.039
 remember sasha jumping tiger who 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.700
 took out prey at the height of three and a half 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.649
 meters sinbad can get item on 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.649
 the same height without taking off the ground
