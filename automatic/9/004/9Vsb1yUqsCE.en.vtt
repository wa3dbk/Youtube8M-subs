of a quarter so they just put one little
arm<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.650> squeeze<00:02:04.490> right<00:02:05.000> through<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:06.110> she

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
arm in and squeeze right through and she

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.530 
arm in and squeeze right through and she
does<00:02:06.590> have<00:02:06.770> hold<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.220> shrimp<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.330> let's

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
does have hold to the shrimp so let's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.530 
does have hold to the shrimp so let's
see<00:02:08.690> if<00:02:08.780> she's<00:02:08.929> gonna<00:02:09.050> be<00:02:09.230> lazy<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.980> not<00:02:10.540> open

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
see if she's gonna be lazy and not open

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.430 
see if she's gonna be lazy and not open
up<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.840> jar<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.390> maybe<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.750> shows<00:02:15.260> how

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
up the jar but maybe that shows how

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.500 
up the jar but maybe that shows how
smart<00:02:15.800> she<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.610> if<00:02:17.000> she<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.300> figure

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
smart she is is that if she can figure

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.640 
smart she is is that if she can figure
out<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.690> way<00:02:17.840> where<00:02:18.020> she<00:02:18.140> doesn't<00:02:18.290> have<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> do

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
out a way where she doesn't have to do

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.420 
out a way where she doesn't have to do
that<00:02:18.680> much

these octopus actually have the ability
to<00:02:29.290> learn<00:02:29.709> by<00:02:30.189> observation<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.360> that's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
to learn by observation and that's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.899 
to learn by observation and that's
something<00:02:32.170> no<00:02:32.530> other<00:02:32.680> invertebrates<00:02:33.099> can<00:02:33.670> do

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
pull apart the octopus moves around with

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.140 
pull apart the octopus moves around with
its<00:02:46.689> arms<00:02:47.049> as<00:02:47.409> well<00:02:47.680> as<00:02:47.829> its<00:02:48.010> siphon<00:02:48.549> which<00:02:49.000> is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
its arms as well as its siphon which is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.660 
its arms as well as its siphon which is
also<00:02:49.359> used<00:02:49.689> for<00:02:49.810> respiration<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.430> if<00:02:51.519> she

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
also used for respiration so if she

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.960 
also used for respiration so if she
takes<00:02:51.879> a<00:02:51.970> lot<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.209> water<00:02:52.950> into<00:02:53.950> her<00:02:54.129> mantle

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
through her gills slits and then she

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.860 
through her gills slits and then she

pushes it out through her safe and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.649 
pushes it out through her safe and
really<00:02:59.079> fast<00:02:59.409> she<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.010> jet<00:03:00.549> across<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.389> tank

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
really fast she can jet across the tank

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:24.440 
really fast she can jet across the tank
really<00:03:02.139> fast
