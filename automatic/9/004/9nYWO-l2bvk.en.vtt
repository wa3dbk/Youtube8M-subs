because<00:01:32.549> although<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.119> looks<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> bit<00:01:33.450> bulky

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
because although it looks a bit bulky

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
because although it looks a bit bulky
and<00:01:33.990> chunky<00:01:34.470> yes<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> does<00:01:35.189> suit<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> headset

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and chunky yes it does suit the headset

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
and chunky yes it does suit the headset
but<00:01:36.390> usually<00:01:37.290> farm<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.890> these

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but usually farm when you got these

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
but usually farm when you got these
bulky<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.490> chunky<00:01:38.820> microphones<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> they

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
bulky and chunky microphones that they

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.240 
bulky and chunky microphones that they
are<00:01:39.600> terrible<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.200> bending<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
are terrible for bending or kind of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
are terrible for bending or kind of
putting<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.729> certain<00:01:41.909> position<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
putting in a certain position but as you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
putting in a certain position but as you
can<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> rubber<00:01:44.369> piece<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
can see it's got like a rubber piece in

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.490 
can see it's got like a rubber piece in
the<00:01:45.390> middle<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.659> allows<00:01:45.990> its<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the middle that allows its kind of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
the middle that allows its kind of
position<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.040> however<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.579> may<00:01:47.729> wish<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
position this however you may wish so

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
position this however you may wish so
which<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.009> we've

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
which you don't really see we've

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.830 
which you don't really see we've
headsets<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.149> allow<00:01:51.390> put<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> nice

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
headsets these they so allow put a nice

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
headsets these they so allow put a nice
curve<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.130> slater

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
curve in it and it will actually slater

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.920 
curve in it and it will actually slater
as<00:01:53.820> well<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.149> left<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:54.899> desk

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
as well actually left this on my desk

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.440 
as well actually left this on my desk
for<00:01:55.680> 24<00:01:56.219> hours<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.790> didn't<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
for 24 hours and it didn't go back to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.969 
for 24 hours and it didn't go back to
its<00:01:57.719> original<00:01:57.810> shape<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.710> obviously

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
its original shape which is obviously

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.429 
its original shape which is obviously
straight<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.939> big<00:02:00.390> props<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> BitFenix<00:02:00.990> for

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
straight so big props the BitFenix for

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
straight so big props the BitFenix for
making<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:02.189> very<00:02:02.399> nice<00:02:02.520> microphone<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
making a very very nice microphone so it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.719 
making a very very nice microphone so it
goes<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.960> far<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.229> connectivity<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.979> your<00:02:05.219> pc

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
goes as far as connectivity to your pc

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.980 
goes as far as connectivity to your pc
obviously<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> microphone<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
obviously have the microphone and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.680 
obviously have the microphone and
headset<00:02:07.200> 3.5<00:02:08.160> s<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:09.000> Lynn<00:02:09.209> leads<00:02:09.420> into

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
headset 3.5 s here this Lynn leads into

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.550 
headset 3.5 s here this Lynn leads into
a<00:02:09.929> female<00:02:10.679> 3.5<00:02:11.489> jack<00:02:11.819> which

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
a female 3.5 jack which

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.040 
a female 3.5 jack which
then<00:02:12.650> allows<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.280> connect<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.670> inline

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
then allows you to connect the inline

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.500 
then allows you to connect the inline
controls<00:02:15.050> which<00:02:15.319> essentially<00:02:15.709> three<00:02:16.130> pole

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
controls which essentially three pole

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.150 
controls which essentially three pole
adapters<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.780> seer<00:02:17.959> 3.5<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.650> either<00:02:18.860> end

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
adapters of a seer 3.5 on either end

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.949 
adapters of a seer 3.5 on either end
which<00:02:19.730> then<00:02:19.940> go<00:02:20.090> into<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.450> inline<00:02:20.840> remote

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
which then go into the inline remote

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.449 
which then go into the inline remote
which<00:02:21.290> obviously<00:02:21.530> has<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.739> mute<00:02:21.980> switch<00:02:22.220> for

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
which obviously has a mute switch for

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.309 
which obviously has a mute switch for
the<00:02:22.489> microphone<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.239> also<00:02:23.750> on<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.959> back<00:02:24.110> you

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the microphone and also on the back you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.199 
the microphone and also on the back you
have<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.530> volume<00:02:25.099> lever<00:02:25.459> here<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.910> goes<00:02:26.030> up

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
have a volume lever here that goes up

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.030 
have a volume lever here that goes up
and<00:02:26.330> down<00:02:26.390> loose<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.870> smoothly<00:02:27.170> which

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
and down loose and smoothly which

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.360 
and down loose and smoothly which
obviously<00:02:28.310> connect<00:02:28.730> into<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.890> 3.5<00:02:30.890> female

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
obviously connect into the 3.5 female

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.940 
obviously connect into the 3.5 female
connection<00:02:31.880> like<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.840> allowing<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.800> be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
connection like so allowing it to be

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.770 
connection like so allowing it to be
extended<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.180> obviously<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.569> other

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
extended and then obviously the other

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.570 
extended and then obviously the other
end<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:36.620> will<00:02:36.920> actually<00:02:37.220> go<00:02:37.400> into

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
end that's here will actually go into

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.400 
end that's here will actually go into
the<00:02:37.970> headset<00:02:38.480> which<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.989> obviously<00:02:39.230> really

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
the headset which is obviously really

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.050 
the headset which is obviously really
really<00:02:39.680> simply<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.190> plug<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.580> jack<00:02:40.790> into

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
really simply just plug the jack into

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
really simply just plug the jack into
the<00:02:41.269> headset<00:02:41.630> jack<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.530> actual<00:02:42.769> headset

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the headset jack on the actual headset

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.460 
the headset jack on the actual headset
like<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.970> away<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.390> go<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:45.230> good<00:02:45.440> thing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
like so and away you go the good thing

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.110 
like so and away you go the good thing
as<00:02:45.739> well<00:02:45.890> actually<00:02:46.130> liked<00:02:46.430> about<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.790> jacks

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
as well actually liked about the jacks

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.420 
as well actually liked about the jacks
fully<00:02:47.450> microphone<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.049> headset<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
fully microphone and headset on the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.100 
fully microphone and headset on the
actual<00:02:49.700> headset<00:02:50.000> itself<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.810> fact<00:02:51.019> that

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
actual headset itself is the fact that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.809 
actual headset itself is the fact that
they<00:02:51.500> are<00:02:51.530> actually<00:02:51.920> quite<00:02:52.010> tough<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.580> get<00:02:52.700> out

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
they are actually quite tough to get out

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.160 
they are actually quite tough to get out
there<00:02:53.150> as<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.420> can<00:02:53.510> see<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.720> takes<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.049> little

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
there as you can see it takes a little

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.199 
there as you can see it takes a little
bit<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.350> force<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.920> probably<00:02:55.489> even<00:02:55.580> more<00:02:55.910> on

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
bit of force and probably even more on

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.690 
bit of force and probably even more on
the<00:02:56.299> actual<00:02:56.540> headset<00:02:56.870> cables<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.549> props<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the actual headset cables so props the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.100 
the actual headset cables so props the
BitFenix<00:02:58.849> for<00:02:59.299> making<00:02:59.540> those<00:02:59.660> secure

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
BitFenix for making those secure

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.080 
BitFenix for making those secure
connections<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.950> obviously<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.670> hand<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
connections so that obviously in hand a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.120 
connections so that obviously in hand a
little<00:03:02.269> bit<00:03:02.390> movement<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.470> now<00:03:03.620> let's<00:03:03.799> move<00:03:03.950> on

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
little bit movement so now let's move on

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.009 
little bit movement so now let's move on
to<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.310> headset<00:03:04.700> guys<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.269> as<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.780> see

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
it's very much looking hits it's

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.860 
it's very much looking hits it's
actually<00:03:07.790> very<00:03:07.819> very<00:03:08.030> lightweight<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.599> it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870

obviously have the chrome bitfenix logo
on<00:03:12.380> here<00:03:12.650> obviously<00:03:13.340> they're<00:03:13.489> Jack's<00:03:13.700> we've

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
on here obviously they're Jack's we've

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.370 
on here obviously they're Jack's we've
already<00:03:14.060> talked<00:03:14.390> about<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.750> nice<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.080> secure

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
already talked about the nice and secure

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.270 
already talked about the nice and secure
once<00:03:15.590> they've<00:03:15.769> actually<00:03:15.920> got<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
once they've actually got the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.250 
once they've actually got the
connections<00:03:16.549> in<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.540> ear<00:03:17.660> cups<00:03:17.930> are<00:03:18.079> very

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
connections in and the ear cups are very

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.830 
connections in and the ear cups are very
very<00:03:18.440> comfortable<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.120> said<00:03:20.329> on<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> side

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
very comfortable like I said on the side

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.360 
very comfortable like I said on the side
there's<00:03:21.049> no<00:03:21.200> real<00:03:21.500> adjustability<00:03:22.010> because

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
there's no real adjustability because

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.830 
there's no real adjustability because
obviously<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.790> lot<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.329> adjustable

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
obviously a lot of it is adjustable

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.020 
obviously a lot of it is adjustable
through<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.200> actual<00:03:24.590> stretch<00:03:25.519> your<00:03:25.700> headband

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
through the actual stretch your headband

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.940 
through the actual stretch your headband
on<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.329> top<00:03:26.540> another<00:03:26.900> headset<00:03:27.109> quality<00:03:27.650> uses

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
on the top another headset quality uses

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.740 
on the top another headset quality uses
the<00:03:28.069> same<00:03:28.220> method<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.269> there's<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.510> little<00:03:29.630> bit

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
the same method but there's a little bit

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.930 
the same method but there's a little bit
of<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.959> complaint<00:03:30.410> from<00:03:30.680> me<00:03:30.769> really<00:03:31.280> there's<00:03:31.910> a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
of a complaint from me really there's a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.550 
of a complaint from me really there's a
little<00:03:32.090> bit<00:03:32.239> too<00:03:32.420> much<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.569> vertical<00:03:33.140> movement

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
little bit too much a vertical movement

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.720 
little bit too much a vertical movement
in<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.769> ear<00:03:33.829> cups<00:03:34.130> once<00:03:34.340> they're<00:03:34.519> on<00:03:34.549> your

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
in the ear cups once they're on your

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.250 
in the ear cups once they're on your
head<00:03:34.790> they<00:03:35.060> tend<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.359> just<00:03:35.569> flop<00:03:35.870> back<00:03:36.019> and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
head they tend to just flop back and

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.349 
head they tend to just flop back and
forwards<00:03:36.650> maybe<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.670> would<00:03:37.819> look<00:03:37.970> see<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.180> little

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
forwards maybe I would look see a little

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.020 
forwards maybe I would look see a little
bit<00:03:38.480> less<00:03:38.930> vertical<00:03:39.250> flexibility<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.760> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
bit less vertical flexibility in the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.759 
bit less vertical flexibility in the
actual<00:03:41.329> ear<00:03:41.510> cups<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.959> maybe<00:03:42.170> some<00:03:42.440> horizontal

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
actual ear cups of maybe some horizontal

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.590 
actual ear cups of maybe some horizontal
movement<00:03:43.489> just<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.730> allow<00:03:43.970> them<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.329> kind<00:03:44.540> of

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
movement just to allow them to kind of

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.729 
movement just to allow them to kind of
sit<00:03:44.870> more<00:03:45.019> comfortable<00:03:45.410> on<00:03:45.500> your<00:03:45.560> head

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
sit more comfortable on your head

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.410 
sit more comfortable on your head
although<00:03:46.370> these<00:03:46.519> are<00:03:46.730> very<00:03:46.940> very<00:03:47.120> lightweight

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
although these are very very lightweight

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.120 
although these are very very lightweight
and<00:03:47.600> after<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.380> while<00:03:48.500> you<00:03:48.709> won't<00:03:48.799> even<00:03:48.920> notice

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
and after a while you won't even notice

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.650 
and after a while you won't even notice
that<00:03:49.250> you're<00:03:49.489> wearing<00:03:49.819> them<00:03:49.940> it's<00:03:50.389> just<00:03:50.600> a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
that you're wearing them it's just a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.150 
that you're wearing them it's just a
little<00:03:50.780> big<00:03:50.959> thing<00:03:51.290> for<00:03:51.319> me<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.950> would

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
little big thing for me that I would

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.890 
little big thing for me that I would
have<00:03:52.400> generally<00:03:53.060> probably<00:03:53.389> I'd<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.780> have

closed<00:04:12.650> back<00:04:12.889> designs<00:04:13.220> I've<00:04:13.489> been<00:04:13.579> taking<00:04:13.910> on

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
closed back designs I've been taking on

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
closed back designs I've been taking on
the<00:04:14.180> move<00:04:14.329> with<00:04:14.720> your<00:04:14.870> mobile<00:04:15.019> device<00:04:15.530> that's

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
the move with your mobile device that's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.770 
the move with your mobile device that's
also<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.549> good<00:04:16.609> thing<00:04:16.910> as<00:04:17.000> well<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.450> obviously

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
also a good thing as well and obviously

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.690 
also a good thing as well and obviously
if<00:04:18.079> you're<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.350> local<00:04:18.620> an<00:04:18.919> event<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.340> stuff<00:04:19.549> as

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
if you're a local an event and stuff as

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.979 
if you're a local an event and stuff as
well<00:04:19.850> with<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.030> clothes<00:04:20.209> back<00:04:20.419> design<00:04:20.690> off<00:04:20.840> so

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
well with the clothes back design off so

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.630 
well with the clothes back design off so
you<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.140> cancel<00:04:21.380> out<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.890> fair<00:04:22.400> bit<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
you can cancel out a fair bit of

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.670 
you can cancel out a fair bit of
background<00:04:22.880> noise<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.599> but<00:04:24.169> overall<00:04:24.440> i've

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
my review of the BitFenix flow gaming

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.309 
my review of the BitFenix flow gaming
headset<00:04:44.240> now<00:04:44.389> other<00:04:44.599> than<00:04:44.779> the<00:04:44.930> issue<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.259> the

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
headset now other than the issue of the

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.439 
headset now other than the issue of the
rotation<00:04:45.770> on<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.520> actual<00:04:46.909> headset<00:04:47.210> just<00:04:47.389> to

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
rotation on the actual headset just to

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.640 
rotation on the actual headset just to
make<00:04:47.569> it<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.719> little<00:04:47.810> bit<00:04:47.960> more<00:04:48.050> comfortable

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
make it a little bit more comfortable

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.170 
make it a little bit more comfortable
and<00:04:48.800> probably<00:04:49.129> a<00:04:49.219> little<00:04:49.310> bit<00:04:49.490> more<00:04:49.669> durable

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
and probably a little bit more durable

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.089 
and probably a little bit more durable
I'd<00:04:50.840> say<00:04:51.139> it's<00:04:51.289> actually<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.620> very<00:04:51.740> very<00:04:51.949> good

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
I'd say it's actually a very very good

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.399 
I'd say it's actually a very very good
headset<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:53.210> looks<00:04:53.389> funky<00:04:53.779> it's<00:04:53.900> got<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.050> quirky

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
headset it looks funky it's got a quirky

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.019 
headset it looks funky it's got a quirky
design<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.189> I<00:04:55.219> really<00:04:55.520> do<00:04:55.639> like<00:04:55.819> the

design and I really do like the

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.339

detachable<00:04:56.360> microphone<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.050> actually<00:04:57.319> a

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
detachable microphone is actually a

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.260
