00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
 to swim to the flock is not any matter 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.440
 who yesterday is an American crocodile 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.700
 even futile death in general it's 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.269
 rather the alligators found at 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.269
 pool background 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.660
 here is the boom 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660
 okay 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.130
 then caught a crocodile in a pool 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.689
 it's a first for me I feel 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:35.309
 not really like a fish in the water 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.960
 but I intend to stay dry and not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.190
 take no chances to capture this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.580
 crocodile effect it is deeper 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 it's clever watch out if the scene 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.290
 does not come off the pole he can you 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.290
 lead to the bottom it would be ugly 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.979
 whenever I'm in the presence of a 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.339
 wild animal adrenaline rises in 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.530
 arrow 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.729
 I'm hot I'm sweating I'm nervous 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.729
 and I tremble even a little 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.620
 be careful shot with a quick jerk 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.790
 be careful 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.110
 so 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.690
 he's stuck nine doors 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 okay 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.729
 immobilized the I hold him I'm going to him 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:56.009
 shut up after I arrive because 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.159
 it's an American crocodile that is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.600
 that they risk nothing at all we will 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.340
 immediately relax in nature 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.330
 hoping they stay away 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.480
 swimming pools ready pretty much it's good 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.100
 he's a big guy 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.780
 it is heavy we whip the buttocks 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.280
 you have to be beefy I spent 20 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.290
 years of my life hunting down the crocodile 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.580
 American without ever seeing a single 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.170
 is now I see everywhere in the city 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.780
 for the survival of the species it's great 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.620
 but the population does not accept the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.620
 presence of the crocodile
