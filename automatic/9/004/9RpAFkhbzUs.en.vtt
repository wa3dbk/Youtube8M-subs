00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
this little B character after that I

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.080 
this little B character after that I
went<00:01:43.349> in<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.859> painted<00:01:44.249> the<00:01:44.459> sky<00:01:44.729> background

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
went in and I painted the sky background

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
went in and I painted the sky background
on<00:01:45.659> another<00:01:46.139> layer<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.679> I<00:01:47.039> make<00:01:47.249> sure<00:01:47.459> I<00:01:47.490> label

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
on another layer and I make sure I label

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.429 
on another layer and I make sure I label
each<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> these<00:01:48.420> layers<00:01:48.719> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.020> didn't<00:01:49.289> get

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
each of these layers so I didn't get

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.639 
each of these layers so I didn't get
lost<00:01:49.679> while<00:01:50.099> I'm<00:01:50.279> doing<00:01:50.579> them<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:51.560> painted<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
lost while I'm doing them I painted a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.609 
lost while I'm doing them I painted a
clouds<00:01:52.979> layer<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.539> can<00:01:54.719> see<00:01:55.020> through<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.469> B

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
clouds layer and I can see through the B

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.409 
clouds layer and I can see through the B
because<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> did<00:01:56.429> was<00:01:56.609> draw<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.880> outline

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:57.419 
because all I did was draw the outline

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:59.239 
because all I did was draw the outline
of<00:01:57.450> him<00:01:57.779> if<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.020> turn<00:01:58.229> him<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.499> off<00:01:58.709> you<00:01:58.859> can<00:01:59.009> see

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
of him if I turn him on off you can see

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.929 
of him if I turn him on off you can see
that<00:01:59.479> created<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.539> new<00:02:00.719> layer<00:02:00.929> here<00:02:01.759> filled<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that created a new layer here filled in

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179 
that created a new layer here filled in
the<00:02:03.090> color<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.990> case<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.529> started<00:02:04.889> using

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the color in this case I started using

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.359 
the color in this case I started using
the<00:02:05.849> square<00:02:06.119> hard<00:02:06.509> pastel<00:02:07.049> brush<00:02:07.349> and<00:02:07.679> then

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the square hard pastel brush and then

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.330 
the square hard pastel brush and then
finally<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.200> gray<00:02:10.500> color<00:02:10.530> over

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
finally I put in this gray color over

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.339 
finally I put in this gray color over
his<00:02:11.489> wings<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.349> I'll<00:02:13.349> switch<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.760> next

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
his wings here I'll switch to the next

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.740 
his wings here I'll switch to the next
image

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.270 

here's<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.900> next<00:02:20.170> image<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> series<00:02:20.920> so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
here's the next image in the series so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.860 
here's the next image in the series so
you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.580> see<00:02:21.819> where<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.090> left<00:02:22.330> off<00:02:22.569> with<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you can see where I left off with the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.650 
you can see where I left off with the
earlier<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.709> lowered<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.819> opacity<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
earlier one I lowered the opacity of the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.630 
earlier one I lowered the opacity of the
wings<00:02:25.900> layer<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.980> see<00:02:27.190> through<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
wings layer so you can see through it a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.390 
wings layer so you can see through it a
little<00:02:27.910> bit<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:29.080> started<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.680> add<00:02:29.830> some

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
little bit and I started to add some

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.320 
little bit and I started to add some
shading<00:02:31.500> using<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.099> fine<00:02:33.370> spray<00:02:33.790> airbrush

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
shading using the fine spray airbrush

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.380 
shading using the fine spray airbrush
tool<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:35.250> painted<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.430> over<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:36.940> separate

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
tool I painted this over on separate

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.449 
tool I painted this over on separate
layers<00:02:37.599> carefully<00:02:38.319> erasing<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.310> there

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
layers carefully erasing here and there

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.670 
layers carefully erasing here and there
and<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.390> last<00:02:40.690> layer<00:02:40.989> painted<00:02:41.530> some

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
and on this last layer painted some

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.650 
and on this last layer painted some
highlights<00:02:42.160> down<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.790> side<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.450> be

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
highlights down the side of the be

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.860 
highlights down the side of the be
really<00:02:44.560> easy<00:02:44.799> default<00:02:45.640> brushes<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.360> use

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
really easy default brushes I use

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.690 
really easy default brushes I use
multiply<00:02:47.799> normal<00:02:48.640> or<00:02:48.849> screen<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:50.140> my<00:02:50.290> layers

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
multiply normal or screen for my layers

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.100 
multiply normal or screen for my layers
so<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.730> highlights<00:02:52.209> here<00:02:52.390> would<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.690> screen

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
so the highlights here would be screen

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.770 
so the highlights here would be screen
the<00:02:53.590> shading<00:02:54.010> layers<00:02:54.220> or<00:02:54.459> multiply<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.540> B

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the shading layers or multiply the B

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.949 
the shading layers or multiply the B
layer<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.410> default<00:02:56.890> layer<00:02:57.450> close<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.720> one

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
layer is a default layer close this one

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.960

here<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.269> added<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.760> copied<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.910> whole<00:03:43.060> B<00:03:43.510> layer

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
here I added I copied the whole B layer

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.670 
here I added I copied the whole B layer
I<00:03:44.049> paste<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.680> into<00:03:44.889> itself<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.670> applied<00:03:46.510> some

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
I paste it into itself I applied some

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.620 
I paste it into itself I applied some
lighting<00:03:47.730> under<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.880> effects<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:52.450> goes

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
lighting under the effects as it goes

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.330 
lighting under the effects as it goes
off<00:03:52.900> screen<00:03:54.419> well<00:03:55.419> it<00:03:55.660> shows<00:03:56.290> apply<00:03:56.829> lighting

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
off screen well it shows apply lighting

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.390 
off screen well it shows apply lighting
and<00:03:58.319> created<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.470> on<00:03:59.620> this<00:03:59.919> new<00:04:00.130> layer<00:04:00.370> then

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
and created it on this new layer then

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.870 
and created it on this new layer then
erased<00:04:01.030> here<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:01.480> there<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
erased here and there so that the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.220 
erased here and there so that the
lighting<00:04:04.120> had<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.480> little<00:04:04.690> effect<00:04:05.049> of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
lighting had a little effect of

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.000 
lighting had a little effect of
darkening<00:04:05.769> on<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.579> side<00:04:07.590> go<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.799> next

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
darkening on this side go to the next

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.440 
darkening on this side go to the next
one<00:04:09.190> we're<00:04:09.310> almost<00:04:09.430> done<00:04:09.790> here<00:04:10.000> is<00:04:10.060> really

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
one we're almost done here is really

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.170 
one we're almost done here is really
quick<00:04:10.690> process<00:04:11.639> very<00:04:12.639> easy<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.269> do<00:04:14.700> all<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.760> the
