00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.290 
a little while ago I was discussing

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.260 
a little while ago I was discussing
theory<00:00:05.830> with<00:00:05.980> somebody<00:00:06.279> online<00:00:06.399> and<00:00:06.880> they

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
theory with somebody online and they

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.030 
theory with somebody online and they
brought<00:00:07.480> up<00:00:07.630> the<00:00:07.750> RCP<00:00:08.260> Canada<00:00:08.620> and<00:00:08.710> I<00:00:08.799> said

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
brought up the RCP Canada and I said

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.860 
brought up the RCP Canada and I said
that<00:00:09.160> I<00:00:09.190> didn't<00:00:09.520> support<00:00:09.820> the<00:00:09.940> RCP<00:00:10.480> Canada

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
that I didn't support the RCP Canada

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.720 
that I didn't support the RCP Canada
they<00:00:11.230> asked<00:00:11.440> me<00:00:11.559> why<00:00:11.769> and<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:12.040> said<00:00:12.280> well<00:00:12.519> it<00:00:12.610> was

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
they asked me why and I said well it was

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.089 
they asked me why and I said well it was
mainly<00:00:13.179> because<00:00:13.510> of<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:14.080> third<00:00:14.679> world<00:00:14.920> is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
mainly because of the third world is

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.249 
mainly because of the third world is
position<00:00:15.610> that<00:00:15.759> i<00:00:15.820> do<00:00:15.880> have<00:00:16.180> they<00:00:16.900> asked<00:00:17.080> me<00:00:17.170> if

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
position that i do have they asked me if

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.260 
position that i do have they asked me if
I<00:00:17.320> had<00:00:17.590> any<00:00:17.740> like<00:00:17.980> criticisms<00:00:18.760> like<00:00:19.090> real

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
I had any like criticisms like real

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.630 
I had any like criticisms like real
criticisms<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.529> line<00:00:20.710> that<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:21.039> RCP

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
criticisms of the line that the RCP

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.359 
criticisms of the line that the RCP
can't<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.090> holt<00:00:22.300> so<00:00:22.990> he<00:00:23.109> said<00:00:23.289> do<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:23.859> could

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
can't the holt so he said do you could

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.340 
can't the holt so he said do you could
you<00:00:24.460> do<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.580> video<00:00:24.820> on<00:00:24.970> it<00:00:25.269> and<00:00:25.390> then<00:00:25.840> I<00:00:26.019> sat<00:00:26.080> down

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
you do a video on it and then I sat down

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.630 
you do a video on it and then I sat down
I<00:00:26.470> thought<00:00:26.500> about<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.010> I<00:00:27.100> jotted<00:00:27.340> down<00:00:27.490> a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
I thought about it and I jotted down a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.000 
I thought about it and I jotted down a
few<00:00:27.760> ideas<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:28.539> then<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:28.990> realized<00:00:29.470> you<00:00:29.740> know

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
few ideas and then I realized you know

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.330 
few ideas and then I realized you know
this<00:00:30.310> could<00:00:30.550> be<00:00:30.760> a<00:00:31.029> small<00:00:31.510> book<00:00:32.129> there<00:00:33.129> was

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
this could be a small book there was

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.430 
this could be a small book there was
enough<00:00:33.730> they're<00:00:34.000> really<00:00:34.420> for<00:00:34.660> me<00:00:34.750> when<00:00:35.140> really

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
enough they're really for me when really

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.959 
enough they're really for me when really
talking<00:00:35.920> about<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.130> theory<00:00:36.430> that's<00:00:36.640> put

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
talking about the theory that's put

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.450 
talking about the theory that's put
forward<00:00:37.239> by<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.570> organization<00:00:38.410> that<00:00:39.340> it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
forward by the organization that it

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.030 
forward by the organization that it
could<00:00:39.610> be<00:00:39.760> made<00:00:40.000> into<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.629> whole<00:00:40.750> book<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
could be made into a whole book so

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.530 
could be made into a whole book so
that's<00:00:42.190> exactly<00:00:42.340> what<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.760> did<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:43.450> I've

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
that's exactly what I did so I've

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.900 
that's exactly what I did so I've
produced<00:00:43.870> this<00:00:44.110> new<00:00:44.320> book<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:45.370> bloody<00:00:45.610> feet

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
produced this new book the bloody feet

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.190 
produced this new book the bloody feet
of<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.420> RCP<00:00:46.989> Canada<00:00:47.379> now<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.760> title<00:00:49.480> may<00:00:49.870> seem

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
of the RCP Canada now the title may seem

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.170 
of the RCP Canada now the title may seem
rather<00:00:50.410> odd<00:00:50.680> but<00:00:51.010> it's<00:00:51.129> actually<00:00:51.430> referring

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
rather odd but it's actually referring

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.810 
rather odd but it's actually referring
to<00:00:52.480> something<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.989> Mao<00:00:53.440> had<00:00:53.739> said<00:00:54.010> he<00:00:54.670> called

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
to something that Mao had said he called

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.560 
to something that Mao had said he called
it<00:00:55.000> cutting<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> toes<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.680> fit<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.100> shoes

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it cutting the toes to fit the shoes

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.389 
it cutting the toes to fit the shoes
meaning<00:00:58.570> he<00:00:58.930> was<00:00:59.079> criticizing<00:00:59.590> people<00:00:59.949> for

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
meaning he was criticizing people for

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.930 
meaning he was criticizing people for
not<00:01:00.940> having<00:01:01.480> Theory<00:01:01.960> fit<00:01:02.489> reality<00:01:03.489> instead

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
not having Theory fit reality instead

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.560 
not having Theory fit reality instead
trying<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.509> make<00:01:04.660> reality<00:01:05.399> fit<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.549> theory<00:01:06.909> so

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
trying to make reality fit the theory so

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.840 
trying to make reality fit the theory so
he<00:01:07.930> accused<00:01:08.320> them<00:01:08.439> of<00:01:08.500> cutting<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.340> toes<00:01:09.580> to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
he accused them of cutting the toes to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.810 
he accused them of cutting the toes to
fit<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> shoes<00:01:10.299> instead<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.750> building<00:01:10.960> shoes

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
fit the shoes instead of building shoes

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.890 
fit the shoes instead of building shoes
specifically<00:01:12.820> for<00:01:12.880> these<00:01:13.240> people<00:01:13.540> feet<00:01:13.720> and
