casio g-shock
GW<00:00:13.519> 6901<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:16.970> what's<00:00:17.970> very<00:00:18.210> special<00:00:18.449> about

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
GW 6901 and what's very special about

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.480 
GW 6901 and what's very special about
this<00:00:19.050> watch<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.820> it's<00:00:20.820> actually<00:00:22.310> it's<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
this watch is it's actually it's got a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.420 
this watch is it's actually it's got a
very<00:00:23.760> retro<00:00:24.029> team<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:25.109> looks<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.279> old

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
very retro team it looks like a very old

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
very retro team it looks like a very old
fashioned<00:00:26.970> watch<00:00:27.150> except<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.779> being

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
fashioned watch except it's being

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
fashioned watch except it's being
updated<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.279> new<00:00:29.910> tough<00:00:30.210> solar

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
updated to have a new tough solar

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.229 
updated to have a new tough solar
technology<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:31.500> basically<00:00:32.000> stands<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
technology which basically stands for

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.630 
technology which basically stands for
Cassio's<00:00:33.829> proprietary<00:00:34.829> solar<00:00:35.280> charging

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
Cassio's proprietary solar charging

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.889 
Cassio's proprietary solar charging
technology<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:38.270> multiband<00:00:39.270> 6<00:00:39.660> which

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
technology and multiband 6 which

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
technology and multiband 6 which
basically<00:00:40.290> means<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.980> syncs<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> atomic

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
basically means it syncs with the atomic

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.010 
basically means it syncs with the atomic
clocks<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.640> basically<00:00:44.969> comes<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.629> tin

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
clocks so it basically comes in this tin

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.470 
clocks so it basically comes in this tin
says<00:00:46.649> g-shock<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:49.910> let<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.180> ahead<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
says g-shock and let me go ahead and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.810 
says g-shock and let me go ahead and
open<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> box<00:00:55.370> has<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.610> foam<00:00:57.539> piece

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
open up the box has this foam piece

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.840 
open up the box has this foam piece
manual<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> module<00:01:01.289> 3<00:01:01.620> 179<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
manual it's got the module 3 179 and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
manual it's got the module 3 179 and
what<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> module<00:01:03.570> basically<00:01:04.350> means<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.890> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
what the module basically means is it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
what the module basically means is it's
the<00:01:05.309> primary<00:01:05.790> electronic<00:01:06.479> component<00:01:06.960> that's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the primary electronic component that's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
the primary electronic component that's
inside<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.479> watch<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:10.430> controls<00:01:11.430> certain

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
inside the watch which controls certain
functions<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.930> such<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.670> one

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
functions which such as I think this one

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990 
functions which such as I think this one
has<00:01:15.060> multi<00:01:15.840> band<00:01:16.020> six<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.759> tough<00:01:17.759> solar

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
has multi band six and tough solar

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.649 
has multi band six and tough solar
technology<00:01:19.310> along<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.180> and

technology along with all the time and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.850 
technology along with all the time and
I'll<00:01:22.439> quickly<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.159> those<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> inside

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
I'll quickly go over those so and inside

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.300 
I'll quickly go over those so and inside
I<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> warranty<00:01:26.640> information<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:28.310> user

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.380 
features such as what is the battery
strength<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.950> low<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.819> high<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.060> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
strength so is it low is it high is it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.670 
strength so is it low is it high is it
medium<00:02:59.720> that's<00:02:59.900> basically<00:03:00.350> what<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
medium that's basically what the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.430 
medium that's basically what the
leftmost<00:03:00.950> indicator<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.570> case<00:03:02.630> it's<00:03:03.230> on

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
leftmost indicator is in my case it's on

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.630 
leftmost indicator is in my case it's on
high<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.660> I'm<00:03:05.660> gonna<00:03:05.900> try<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.470> see<00:03:06.890> if<00:03:07.340> we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
high and I'm gonna try and see if we

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.140 
high and I'm gonna try and see if we
didn't<00:03:07.910> even<00:03:08.150> capture<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:10.670> there<00:03:10.850> you<00:03:10.970> go

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
didn't even capture that so there you go

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.250 
didn't even capture that so there you go
it<00:03:11.359> says<00:03:11.600> charge<00:03:12.100> low<00:03:13.120> medium<00:03:14.120> high<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:14.930> then

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it says charge low medium high and then

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.170 
it says charge low medium high and then
I<00:03:15.290> have<00:03:15.560> PS<00:03:15.920> which<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.310> basically<00:03:16.640> Power<00:03:16.910> Save

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
I have PS which is basically Power Save

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.009 
I have PS which is basically Power Save
enabled<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:19.579> next<00:03:19.880> one<00:03:20.090> basically<00:03:20.660> has<00:03:20.840> the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
enabled the next one basically has the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.120 
enabled the next one basically has the
auto<00:03:21.200> illumination<00:03:22.100> mute<00:03:23.019> alarm<00:03:24.019> snows<00:03:24.709> and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
auto illumination mute alarm snows and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.300 
auto illumination mute alarm snows and
signal<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.660> those<00:03:26.870> are<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.310> primary

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
signal so those are the primary

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.069 
signal so those are the primary
functions<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.540> one<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.900> rightmost

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
functions and the one on the rightmost

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.099 
functions and the one on the rightmost
basically<00:03:30.950> shows<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.609> seconds<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.959> watch

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
basically shows the seconds of the watch

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.990 
basically shows the seconds of the watch
of<00:03:33.410> course<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.880> watch

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
of course you can see that the watch

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.050 
of course you can see that the watch
also<00:03:35.239> has<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.780> daylight<00:03:36.170> saving<00:03:36.680> and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
also has like daylight saving and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.750 
also has like daylight saving and
several<00:03:38.060> other<00:03:38.269> features<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:40.430> let<00:03:40.609> me<00:03:40.730> just

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
several other features and let me just

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.620 
several other features and let me just
quickly<00:03:41.030> cycle<00:03:41.870> through<00:03:42.819> some<00:03:43.819> of<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.329> modes

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
quickly cycle through some of the modes

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.050 
quickly cycle through some of the modes
that's<00:03:45.139> roll<00:03:45.410> time<00:03:47.290> alarm

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that's roll time alarm

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.550 
that's roll time alarm
stopwatch<00:03:51.980> timer<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:54.200> back<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.530> original

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
stopwatch timer and back to the original

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.830 
stopwatch timer and back to the original
mode<00:03:56.129> now<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.849> world<00:03:57.030> time<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.360> think<00:03:57.720> there

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
mode now in the world time I think there

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.440 
mode now in the world time I think there
are<00:03:57.870> 48<00:03:58.319> different<00:03:58.590> cities<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.580> which<00:03:59.760> you

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
are 48 different cities to which you

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.530 
are 48 different cities to which you
could<00:04:00.569> actually<00:04:00.750> have<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.260> watch<00:04:01.440> set<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
could actually have the watch set and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.920 
could actually have the watch set and
the<00:04:04.410> alarm<00:04:04.769> has<00:04:05.129> four<00:04:05.610> alarms<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.569> snooze

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
the alarm has four alarms and a snooze

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.460 
the alarm has four alarms and a snooze
mode<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:08.069> can<00:04:08.819> typically<00:04:09.269> like<00:04:10.080> once<00:04:10.349> you

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
mode so you can typically like once you

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.009 
mode so you can typically like once you
go<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.650> world<00:04:10.920> time<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:12.000> go<00:04:12.599> through<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
go to world time you can go through the

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.780 
go to world time you can go through the
different<00:04:13.050> wall<00:04:13.530> turns<00:04:13.800> by<00:04:14.069> hitting<00:04:14.580> the

another<00:04:24.840> thing<00:04:25.169> is<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:26.520> course<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.660> has<00:04:27.930> a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
another thing is of course it has a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.969 
another thing is of course it has a
backlight<00:04:29.010> illumination<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.620> for<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.770> what

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
backlight illumination and for that what

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.610 
backlight illumination and for that what
I'm<00:04:32.100> gonna<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.970> just<00:04:33.030> turn<00:04:33.990> off<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.200> flash

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
I'm gonna do is just turn off the flash

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.810 
I'm gonna do is just turn off the flash
and<00:04:36.710> there<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.800> see<00:04:38.010> that's<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.430> backlight

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
and there you see that's the backlight

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.360 
and there you see that's the backlight
elimination<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.990> there<00:04:40.889> is<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.040> mode<00:04:41.340> called

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
elimination and there is a mode called

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.020 
elimination and there is a mode called
Auto<00:04:42.030> al<00:04:42.660> where<00:04:43.229> you<00:04:43.979> actually<00:04:44.160> set<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.639> by

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
Auto al where you actually set that by

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.180 
Auto al where you actually set that by
holding<00:04:45.330> down<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:48.919> illumination<00:04:49.919> button

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
holding down the illumination button

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.730 
holding down the illumination button
which<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.370> basically<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.090> G<00:04:51.330> switch<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.350> once

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
which is basically the G switch and once

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.890 
which is basically the G switch and once
you<00:04:52.889> do<00:04:53.070> that<00:04:53.100> every<00:04:53.910> time<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.330> tilt<00:04:54.630> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
you do that every time you tilt the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.730 
you do that every time you tilt the
watch<00:04:55.520> say<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:57.060> look<00:04:57.840> at<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.110> time

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
watch say to look at the time

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.740 
watch say to look at the time
when<00:04:59.520> your<00:04:59.669> watch<00:04:59.910> kind<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.389> reaches

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
when your watch kind of reaches

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.510 
when your watch kind of reaches
approximately<00:05:00.900> about<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.800> 40<00:05:02.190> degree<00:05:02.490> angle

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
approximately about a 40 degree angle

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.969

the out of the light automatically

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.390 
the out of the light automatically
eliminates<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.639> is<00:05:05.789> great<00:05:06.150> feature<00:05:06.510> because

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
eliminates this is great feature because

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.500 
eliminates this is great feature because
you<00:05:08.400> know<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.550> don't<00:05:08.820> need<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.090> press<00:05:09.300> that

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
you know you don't need to press that

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.180 
you know you don't need to press that
button<00:05:09.720> let's<00:05:10.169> say<00:05:10.320> you're<00:05:10.500> carrying<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:11.010> bag

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
button let's say you're carrying a bag

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.040 
button let's say you're carrying a bag
of<00:05:11.220> groceries<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.450> know<00:05:12.570> you<00:05:12.630> don't<00:05:12.840> want

of groceries and you know you don't want

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.320 
of groceries and you know you don't want
to<00:05:13.110> know<00:05:13.289> what<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.590> time<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:13.830> it's<00:05:14.760> nighttime

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
to know what the time is it's nighttime

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.159 
to know what the time is it's nighttime
you've<00:05:16.080> just<00:05:16.320> killed<00:05:16.530> your<00:05:16.740> hand<00:05:17.070> wrist<00:05:17.430> and

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
you've just killed your hand wrist and

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.710 
you've just killed your hand wrist and
automatically<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.350> light<00:05:19.760> turns<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:21.060> to

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
automatically that light turns on to

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.810 
automatically that light turns on to
show<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:21.960> time<00:05:22.289> which<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.650> perfect<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.700> this

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
show the time which is perfect so this

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.760 
show the time which is perfect so this
is<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.030> great<00:05:24.330> watch<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.840> multiband<00:05:25.410> six

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
is a great watch the multiband six

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.529 
is a great watch the multiband six
feature<00:05:26.070> is<00:05:27.350> a<00:05:28.350> feature<00:05:28.680> which<00:05:29.070> helps<00:05:29.669> the

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
feature is a feature which helps the

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.990 
feature is a feature which helps the
claw<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.380> watch<00:05:31.710> automatically<00:05:32.610> sync

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
claw of the watch automatically sync

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.379 
claw of the watch automatically sync
with<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.750> atomic<00:05:34.310> clocks<00:05:35.310> located<00:05:36.270> around

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
with the atomic clocks located around

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.240 
with the atomic clocks located around
the<00:05:36.660> world<00:05:36.870> there's<00:05:37.139> one<00:05:37.320> in<00:05:37.470> Colorado<00:05:37.889> in<00:05:38.130> the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
the world there's one in Colorado in the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.089 
the world there's one in Colorado in the
US<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.910> think<00:05:39.360> there<00:05:39.720> are<00:05:39.750> two<00:05:40.050> in<00:05:40.229> Japan<00:05:40.650> one<00:05:40.950> in

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
US I think there are two in Japan one in

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.119 
US I think there are two in Japan one in
China

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
China

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.109 
China
in<00:05:42.279> Europe<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:43.449> I<00:05:44.409> may<00:05:44.679> be<00:05:44.739> missing<00:05:45.159> one<00:05:45.309> but<00:05:46.089> I

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:46.119 
in Europe and I may be missing one but I

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.609 
in Europe and I may be missing one but I
think<00:05:46.389> there<00:05:46.509> are<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.629> total<00:05:46.809> of<00:05:46.989> six<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:47.439> those

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:47.619 
think there are a total of six of those

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:50.489 
think there are a total of six of those
and<00:05:47.889> then<00:05:48.849> the<00:05:48.999> tough<00:05:49.179> solar<00:05:49.449> technology<00:05:50.229> is

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:50.499 
and then the tough solar technology is

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.600 
and then the tough solar technology is
the<00:05:51.099> one<00:05:51.279> which<00:05:52.239> basically<00:05:52.779> the<00:05:53.229> face<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:54.399> the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
the one which basically the face of the

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.820 
the one which basically the face of the
clock<00:05:55.389> the<00:05:55.749> one<00:05:55.899> that<00:05:56.050> you<00:05:56.199> see<00:05:56.379> inside<00:05:56.529> the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
clock the one that you see inside the

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.249 
clock the one that you see inside the
one<00:05:56.949> that's<00:05:57.129> in<00:05:57.279> black<00:05:57.519> is<00:05:58.089> actually<00:05:58.749> a<00:05:58.779> solar

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
one that's in black is actually a solar

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.809 
one that's in black is actually a solar
cell<00:05:59.529> so<00:06:01.050> really<00:06:02.050> in<00:06:02.199> very<00:06:02.949> bright<00:06:03.369> direct

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
cell so really in very bright direct

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.609 
cell so really in very bright direct
sunlight<00:06:04.059> the<00:06:04.479> watch<00:06:04.629> takes<00:06:04.989> about<00:06:05.199> five

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:05.619 
sunlight the watch takes about five

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.109 
sunlight the watch takes about five
minutes<00:06:05.649> to<00:06:06.099> completely<00:06:06.459> charge<00:06:06.729> which<00:06:06.999> is

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:07.119 
minutes to completely charge which is

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:09.889 
minutes to completely charge which is
great<00:06:07.389> because<00:06:07.599> you<00:06:07.929> would<00:06:08.289> never<00:06:08.499> have<00:06:09.009> to

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:09.899 
great because you would never have to

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:13.350 
great because you would never have to
charge<00:06:10.899> the<00:06:11.199> watch<00:06:11.729> at<00:06:12.729> any<00:06:12.909> point<00:06:13.209> of<00:06:13.300> time

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
charge the watch at any point of time

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.149 
charge the watch at any point of time
replacing<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.199> battery<00:06:14.499> you<00:06:14.709> don't<00:06:14.889> have<00:06:15.039> to

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
replacing the battery you don't have to

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.639 
replacing the battery you don't have to
do<00:06:15.309> with<00:06:15.429> that<00:06:15.610> often<00:06:16.139> probably<00:06:17.139> even<00:06:17.469> never

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:17.649 
do with that often probably even never

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:20.609 
do with that often probably even never
during<00:06:18.129> the<00:06:18.369> life<00:06:18.759> of<00:06:18.879> the<00:06:18.999> watch<00:06:19.179> so<00:06:19.899> that's

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:20.619 
during the life of the watch so that's

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:28.889 
during the life of the watch so that's
basically<00:06:21.189> the<00:06:21.339> Casio<00:06:23.399> GW<00:06:24.869> 6900<00:06:27.029> it's<00:06:28.029> a<00:06:28.389> quite

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:28.899 
basically the Casio GW 6900 it's a quite

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:32.359 
basically the Casio GW 6900 it's a quite
straightforward<00:06:29.439> watch<00:06:30.219> a<00:06:30.809> fantastic

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
could go ahead and buy another one

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:06.839 
could go ahead and buy another one
because<00:07:05.589> it<00:07:05.769> was<00:07:05.979> virtually<00:07:06.490> indestructible

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:06.849 
because it was virtually indestructible

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139 
the water by default is water resistant

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.829 
the water by default is water resistant
200<00:07:11.800> meters<00:07:12.159> which<00:07:12.789> is<00:07:12.819> great<00:07:13.329> because<00:07:13.689> if

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:13.839
