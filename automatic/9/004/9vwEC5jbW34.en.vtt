00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
hey the new sightings are fully complete

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.890 
hey the new sightings are fully complete
and<00:00:12.940> we've<00:00:13.940> taken<00:00:14.360> things<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.660> little<00:00:14.780> bit

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
and we've taken things a little bit

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.080 
and we've taken things a little bit
further<00:00:15.259> as<00:00:15.469> well<00:00:15.679> then<00:00:16.309> actually<00:00:16.670> labeled

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
further as well then actually labeled

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.990 
further as well then actually labeled
paths<00:00:17.800> so<00:00:18.800> if<00:00:18.890> we<00:00:19.010> look<00:00:19.039> at<00:00:19.220> this<00:00:19.369> sheet<00:00:19.699> here

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
paths so if we look at this sheet here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.460 
paths so if we look at this sheet here
we<00:00:23.000> can<00:00:23.150> see<00:00:23.359> that<00:00:23.539> these<00:00:23.720> are<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:23.930> names<00:00:24.140> for

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
we can see that these are the names for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.790 
we can see that these are the names for
all<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.650> different<00:00:24.949> locos<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:26.380> then<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:27.680> is

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
all the different locos and then this is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.009 
all the different locos and then this is
the<00:00:27.830> path<00:00:28.070> that<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.430> local<00:00:28.789> has<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.029> take<00:00:29.240> and

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
the path that that local has to take and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.960 
the path that that local has to take and
then<00:00:30.230> that's<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.560> side<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:30.980> ends<00:00:31.460> up<00:00:31.550> parked

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
then that's the side and ends up parked

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.720 
then that's the side and ends up parked
him<00:00:32.290> then<00:00:33.290> there's<00:00:33.469> a<00:00:33.559> map<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.130> siding<00:00:34.579> let's

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
him then there's a map the siding let's

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.810 
him then there's a map the siding let's
just<00:00:34.910> here<00:00:37.719> as<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:38.930> can<00:00:38.960> see<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.590> mean<00:00:40.489> it's<00:00:40.670> not

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
just here as you can see I mean it's not

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.569 
just here as you can see I mean it's not
complete<00:00:41.270> obviously<00:00:41.690> c1<00:00:42.170> which<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.160> just<00:00:43.399> over

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
complete obviously c1 which is just over

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.319 
complete obviously c1 which is just over
there<00:00:44.230> still<00:00:45.230> hasn't<00:00:45.379> been<00:00:45.530> finished<00:00:46.239> but<00:00:47.239> it

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
there still hasn't been finished but it

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.150 
there still hasn't been finished but it
will<00:00:47.480> be<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.550> if<00:00:49.820> we<00:00:49.969> just<00:00:50.120> look<00:00:50.450> at<00:00:50.600> one<00:00:51.160> you

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
will be so if we just look at one you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.479 
will be so if we just look at one you
can<00:00:52.370> see<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.350> class<00:00:54.350> away<00:00:54.590> vr<00:00:55.039> in<00:00:55.219> Blue

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
can see that the class away vr in Blue

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.660 
can see that the class away vr in Blue
has<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.989> take<00:00:57.170> path<00:00:57.410> 1<00:00:57.440> then<00:00:57.829> path<00:00:58.070> 3<00:00:58.370> and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
has to take path 1 then path 3 and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.380 
has to take path 1 then path 3 and
there's<00:00:59.059> path<00:00:59.359> 1<00:00:59.600> just<00:01:00.440> there<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.090> then<00:01:02.090> path

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
there's path 1 just there and then path

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.730 
there's path 1 just there and then path
3<00:01:03.190> all<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.250> way<00:01:04.640> down<00:01:04.939> to<00:01:05.409> exciting<00:01:06.939> which<00:01:07.939> is

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
3 all the way down to exciting which is
