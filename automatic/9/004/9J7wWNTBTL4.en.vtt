00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
by eight masonite board you don't need

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.459 
by eight masonite board you don't need
that<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> do

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
that this is just what I do

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
that this is just what I do
and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> start<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.460> by

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and then you want to start off by

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
and then you want to start off by
metering<00:00:51.140> your<00:00:52.140> main<00:00:52.410> light<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.800> your<00:00:52.920> key

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
metering your main light or your key

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
metering your main light or your key
light<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.600> coming<00:00:55.440> down

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
light which is going to be coming down

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.729 
light which is going to be coming down
on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> model<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.809> lights<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
on the model and on the lights for the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.439 
on the model and on the lights for the
back<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.120> ahead<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
back what I do is I just go ahead and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
back what I do is I just go ahead and
set<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:01.079> maximum<00:01:01.649> power<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.100> blow<00:01:02.309> out

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
set them at maximum power to blow out

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.539 
set them at maximum power to blow out
the<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> let's<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.199> ahead<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.409> meter<00:01:04.680> for

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the back so let's go ahead and meter for

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:17.779 
the back so let's go ahead and meter for
the<00:01:05.760> key

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:26.219 

okay<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.090> have<00:01:19.840> 16<00:01:24.390> okay<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.539> case<00:01:25.719> anybody's

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
okay I have 16 okay in case anybody's

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.459 
okay I have 16 okay in case anybody's
curious<00:01:26.579> these<00:01:27.579> head<00:01:27.969> these<00:01:28.270> heads<00:01:28.600> are<00:01:28.840> inter

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
curious these head these heads are inter

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.609 
fit and those are bear bulbs in the back
there's<00:01:33.189> no<00:01:33.310> diffusion<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:33.939> them<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.439> key

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
there's no diffusion on them the key

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.350 
there's no diffusion on them the key
light<00:01:35.799> has<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.039> beauty<00:01:36.459> dish<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.030> which<00:01:37.209> is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
light has a beauty dish on it which is

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.529 
light has a beauty dish on it which is
going<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.569> be<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:39.039> hardest<00:01:39.549> soft<00:01:40.329> light

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
going to be the the hardest soft light

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.480 
going to be the the hardest soft light
that<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.899> can<00:01:41.079> put<00:01:41.259> on<00:01:41.380> there<00:01:41.590> anything

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
that you can put on there anything

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.980 
that you can put on there anything
harder<00:01:42.819> than<00:01:42.939> that<00:01:43.060> you'll<00:01:43.270> probably<00:01:43.420> going

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
harder than that you'll probably going

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.380 
harder than that you'll probably going
bare<00:01:44.469> bulb

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.240 

so<00:01:50.140> let's<00:01:50.320> go<00:01:50.410> ahead<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.650> take<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.800> few<00:01:51.010> shots

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
so let's go ahead and take a few shots

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.230 
so let's go ahead and take a few shots
and<00:01:51.720> we'll<00:01:52.720> see<00:01:52.870> what<00:01:52.990> we<00:01:53.050> get<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.880> may<00:01:55.030> want

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
and we'll see what we get you may want

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.270 
and we'll see what we get you may want
to<00:01:55.330> take<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.600> look<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.080> notice<00:01:56.470> how<00:01:56.650> much<00:01:56.830> light

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
to take a look and notice how much light

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.490 
to take a look and notice how much light
might<00:01:57.760> be<00:01:58.330> spilling<00:01:58.720> onto<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.140> model<00:01:59.410> from

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
might be spilling onto the model from

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.520 
might be spilling onto the model from
the<00:01:59.590> background<00:02:00.480> in<00:02:01.480> that<00:02:01.810> case<00:02:02.080> what<00:02:02.320> you'll

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the background in that case what you'll

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.870 
the background in that case what you'll
need<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.770> do<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.100> either<00:02:03.250> move<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.550> model

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
need to do is either move the model

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.510 
need to do is either move the model
forward<00:02:04.450> or<00:02:04.600> back<00:02:05.230> if<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.920> want<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.190> little<00:02:06.400> bit

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
forward or back if you want a little bit

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.030 
forward or back if you want a little bit
of<00:02:06.640> spill<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.870> edges<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.560> models<00:02:08.830> body

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
of spill on the edges of the models body

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.540 
of spill on the edges of the models body
then<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.780> can<00:02:10.990> go<00:02:11.080> ahead<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.350> put<00:02:11.740> try<00:02:12.490> to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
then you can go ahead and put try to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.060 
then you can go ahead and put try to
move<00:02:13.030> her<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.210> little<00:02:13.360> bit<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> back<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.830> you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
move her a little bit to the back if you

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.440 
move her a little bit to the back if you
don't<00:02:15.190> want<00:02:15.370> any<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.790> light<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:16.300> you're

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
don't want any of that light then you're

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.030 
don't want any of that light then you're
gonna<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> move<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.260> model<00:02:17.440> away<00:02:17.740> from

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
gonna have to move the model away from

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.210 
gonna have to move the model away from
