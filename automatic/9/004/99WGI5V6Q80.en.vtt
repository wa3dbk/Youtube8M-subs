bit<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> cucumber<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.969> little<00:00:42.210> bit

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
bit of a cucumber up it's a little bit

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.639 
bit of a cucumber up it's a little bit
different<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> cucumber<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
different with the cucumber as you have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
different with the cucumber as you have
to<00:00:43.800> take<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.430> safety<00:00:44.730> guard<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.329> order

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to take this safety guard out in order

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.940 
to take this safety guard out in order
to<00:00:45.719> hold<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to hold it in so that's kind of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.020 
to hold it in so that's kind of
something<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.670> bit<00:00:47.820> different

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
something that's a little bit different

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
something that's a little bit different
about<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.140> pampered<00:00:49.530> chef<00:00:49.559> mandolin<00:00:50.370> right

wash<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.649> easy<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> take<00:01:49.979> apart

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
wash it it's pretty easy to take apart

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.170 
wash it it's pretty easy to take apart
and<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.939> here

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and right here

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.230 
and right here
is<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.390> you're<00:01:51.480> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.660> take<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
is where you're going to take the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
is where you're going to take the
attachment<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:55.230> wash<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.740> yes<00:01:56.220> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
attachment out to wash it yes it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.990 
attachment out to wash it yes it's
totally<00:01:56.760> translating<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:59.790> this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
totally translating right out like this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.620 
totally translating right out like this
and<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.770> folds<00:02:02.400> right<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.360> store

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and this just folds right you to store

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.790 
and this just folds right you to store
it<00:02:04.160> goes<00:02:05.160> in<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:06.270> wax<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.620> dirty

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
it goes in there is wax but it's dirty

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.520 
it goes in there is wax but it's dirty
leave<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.490> off<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.600> stores<00:02:09.990> nicely

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
leave it off and it just stores nicely

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.480 
leave it off and it just stores nicely
to<00:02:10.830> take<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.430> potato<00:02:13.130> come<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:14.280> me<00:02:14.459> a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
to take on that potato come with me a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.680 
to take on that potato come with me a
little<00:02:14.820> potato<00:02:18.560> okay<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.220> right<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
little potato okay then just right that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.300 
little potato okay then just right that
stores<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.170> there<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.950> box

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
stores up there and then this box

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.840 
stores up there and then this box
actually<00:02:23.700> will<00:02:24.390> attach<00:02:24.660> onto<00:02:25.550> right<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:26.760> at

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
actually will attach onto right here at

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.660 
actually will attach onto right here at
the<00:02:27.000> end<00:02:27.120> Oh<00:02:27.450> awesome

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the end Oh awesome

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.890 
the end Oh awesome
stores<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.850> rhymes<00:02:30.239> but<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.540> don't<00:02:30.690> even<00:02:30.750> know

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
stores it rhymes but I don't even know

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.110 
stores it rhymes but I don't even know
that<00:02:30.930> yeah<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> didn't<00:02:32.010> even<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.280> night

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that yeah I didn't even know that night

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.780 
that yeah I didn't even know that night
so<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.140> cons<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.130> actually

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
so the cons to this is actually

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
so the cons to this is actually
sometimes<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.600> can<00:02:36.720> be<00:02:36.750> harder<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.260> slice<00:02:37.650> some

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
sometimes it can be harder to slice some

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.380 
sometimes it can be harder to slice some
veggies<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.000> slice<00:02:39.209> um

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
veggies because you have to slice um

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.120 
veggies because you have to slice um
open<00:02:39.660> hand<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.920> won't<00:02:40.980> be

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
open hand like this and you won't be

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.800 
open hand like this and you won't be
able<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.340> use<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.670> finger<00:02:41.970> guard<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.630> right

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
able to use this finger guard like right

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.660 
able to use this finger guard like right
and<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.110> has<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.410> fit<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.010> hole<00:02:44.280> because

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and it has to fit in this hole because

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.580 
and it has to fit in this hole because
this<00:02:44.910> whole<00:02:45.120> mechanism<00:02:45.300> has<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.810> go<00:02:46.110> with<00:02:46.320> it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
this whole mechanism has to go with it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
this whole mechanism has to go with it
and<00:02:46.770> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:46.950> want<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> cut<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.700> fit<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and if you want to cut to fit in the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.229 
and if you want to cut to fit in the
hole<00:02:48.709> perfectly<00:02:49.709> right<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.970> also

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
hole perfectly right and I'm also

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.940 
hole perfectly right and I'm also
compared<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.959> other<00:02:52.050> mainland's<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.680> more

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
compared to other mainland's it's more

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.800 
compared to other mainland's it's more
expensive<00:02:53.130> probably<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.270> one<00:02:54.480> runs<00:02:54.630> about

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
expensive probably this one runs about

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.860 
expensive probably this one runs about
65<00:02:55.380> about<00:02:55.739> $6<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.970> $60<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.570> ones<00:02:57.780> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
65 about $6 it's $60 on other ones you
