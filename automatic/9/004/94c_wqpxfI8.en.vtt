use<00:00:40.579> it<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.050> first<00:00:42.079> thing<00:00:42.379> is<00:00:42.770> what<00:00:43.610> I'm

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
use it so the first thing is what I'm

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.410 
use it so the first thing is what I'm
going<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:43.940> be<00:00:44.090> bending<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.980> second<00:00:46.820> fret

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
going to be bending is the second fret

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.570 
going to be bending is the second fret
on<00:00:48.010> its<00:00:49.010> an<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.309> on<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.610> third<00:00:49.790> string<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.580> I'm

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
on its an a on the third string and I'm

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.329 
on its an a on the third string and I'm
going<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.760> bend<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.120> up<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:54.280> whole-step<00:00:55.510> so<00:00:57.339> make

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
going to bend it up a whole-step so make

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.430 
going to bend it up a whole-step so make
it<00:00:58.489> sound<00:00:58.640> like<00:00:58.760> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.490 

and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.579> down

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and then back down

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.350 
and then back down
then<00:01:04.710> pull<00:01:04.980> off<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> open<00:01:06.030> third<00:01:06.450> string

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
then pull off to the open third string

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.810 
then pull off to the open third string
and<00:01:09.170> finally<00:01:09.530> I'm<00:01:09.620> going<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.830> hit<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.220> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
and finally I'm going to hit the the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.849 
and finally I'm going to hit the the
second<00:01:11.150> fret<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.390> fourth<00:01:11.630> string

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.819 

now<00:01:19.859> that<00:01:20.490> may<00:01:20.759> seem<00:01:20.820> fairly<00:01:21.570> simple<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
now that may seem fairly simple but it

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.349 
now that may seem fairly simple but it
is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.250> bit<00:01:23.369> tricky<00:01:23.579> to<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> come

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
is a little bit tricky to get it to come

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.389 
is a little bit tricky to get it to come
out<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:25.079> it's<00:01:25.590> also<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.250> bit

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
out just right it's also a little bit

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.370 
out just right it's also a little bit
harder<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> bend<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.840> you're<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
harder to bend because you're on the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
harder to bend because you're on the
third<00:01:28.619> string<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.429> second<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
third string and not the second or the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.529 
third string and not the second or the
first

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
first

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.069 
first
as<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.899> often<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:32.030> plus<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.390> lower<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.899> get

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
as we often do plus the lower you get

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
as we often do plus the lower you get
down<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> fretboard<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.969> slightly

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
down on the fretboard this it's slightly

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
down on the fretboard this it's slightly
more<00:01:36.450> difficult<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> Bend<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.979> because

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
more difficult to Bend just because

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
more difficult to Bend just because
you're<00:01:38.729> close<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> nut<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.289> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you're close to the to the nut here so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
you're close to the to the nut here so
it's<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.969> a<00:01:42.060> challenge<00:01:42.270> or

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's a little bit of a challenge or

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
it's a little bit of a challenge or
maybe<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:44.789> get<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:47.369> once<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.969> get<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
maybe to get that up but once you get it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
maybe to get that up but once you get it
I'm<00:01:48.359> sure<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.079> it'll<00:01:49.319> be<00:01:49.350> worth<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.490> know

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I'm sure you it'll be worth it you know

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
I'm sure you it'll be worth it you know
don't<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.849> afraid<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.239> use<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> helper<00:01:51.840> finger

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
don't be afraid to use a helper finger

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.100 
don't be afraid to use a helper finger
you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.709> I<00:01:52.739> have<00:01:52.920> my<00:01:53.039> first<00:01:53.310> finger<00:01:54.110> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you can see I have my first finger just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830 
you can see I have my first finger just
helping<00:01:55.470> me<00:01:55.619> push<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.759> while<00:01:57.179> my<00:01:57.390> while<00:01:57.689> my

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
helping me push it up while my while my

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.240 
helping me push it up while my while my
middle<00:01:58.079> finger<00:01:58.319> makes<00:01:58.530> sure<00:01:58.679> that<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> stays

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
middle finger makes sure that it stays

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.880 
middle finger makes sure that it stays
on<00:01:59.459> the<00:01:59.549> fretboard<00:02:00.259> my<00:02:01.259> first<00:02:01.500> finger<00:02:01.649> can

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
on the fretboard my first finger can

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
on the fretboard my first finger can
help<00:02:02.069> push<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.060> it's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
help push it up and then really it's

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
help push it up and then really it's
just<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.450> matter<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.690> putting<00:02:10.079> that<00:02:10.319> lick<00:02:10.619> into

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
just a matter of putting that lick into

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.000 
just a matter of putting that lick into
the<00:02:12.450> rhythm<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.049> whatever<00:02:13.290> you're<00:02:13.590> doing<00:02:13.860> so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the rhythm of whatever you're doing so

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.199 
the rhythm of whatever you're doing so
if<00:02:14.069> you're<00:02:14.190> doing<00:02:14.310> something<00:02:14.579> like<00:02:14.670> catfish

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
if you're doing something like catfish

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.270 
if you're doing something like catfish
blues<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.049> very<00:02:16.290> slow<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:23.100> I'm

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
blues which is very slow and all I'm

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.210 
blues which is very slow and all I'm
doing<00:02:23.579> during<00:02:24.389> the<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.170> vocal<00:02:25.590> part<00:02:25.829> is<00:02:26.040> just

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
doing during the the vocal part is just

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:37.250 
doing during the the vocal part is just
hitting<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.880> low<00:02:27.030> E<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.480> that's<00:02:36.870> basically

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
hitting the low E and that's basically

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.240 
hitting the low E and that's basically
how<00:02:37.620> almost<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.370> entire<00:02:38.639> song<00:02:38.910> goes<00:02:40.250> for

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
how almost that entire song goes for

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.819 
how almost that entire song goes for
something<00:02:41.519> like<00:02:41.639> voodoo<00:02:41.910> child<00:02:42.359> it's<00:02:43.319> or

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
something like voodoo child it's or

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.240 
something like voodoo child it's or
voodoo<00:02:44.400> child<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.880> guess<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.150> should<00:02:45.329> say

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.860 

and<00:02:50.250> there's<00:02:51.209> going<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.510> subtle

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
and there's going to be subtle

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.569 
and there's going to be subtle
variations<00:02:52.379> depending<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.920> which<00:02:53.099> version<00:02:53.489> of

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
variations depending on which version of

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.550 
variations depending on which version of
this<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.909> hear<00:02:54.299> but<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:54.900> basically<00:02:55.079> playing

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this you hear but I'm basically playing

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.260 
this you hear but I'm basically playing
an<00:02:55.799> E

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
an E

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.750 
an E
and<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:57.900> I'm<00:02:58.020> doing<00:02:58.320> on<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.620> one<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.550> I'm

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
and what I'm doing on this one is I'm

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.370 
and what I'm doing on this one is I'm
not<00:02:59.910> really<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.420> not<00:03:00.480> really<00:03:00.690> pushing<00:03:01.080> down

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
not really I'm not really pushing down

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.310 
not really I'm not really pushing down
on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.680> third<00:03:01.860> string<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:03.990> power

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
on the third string so I get a power

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.850 
on the third string so I get a power
chord<00:03:04.680> instead<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:06.590> full-blown<00:03:07.590> major

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
chord instead of a full-blown major

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.010 
chord instead of a full-blown major
chord

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
chord

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.330 
chord
it<00:03:10.020> gives<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.350> slightly<00:03:10.770> different<00:03:10.890> sound

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it gives it a slightly different sound

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.360 
it gives it a slightly different sound
here's<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.820> powerful<00:03:15.830> so<00:03:16.830> I'll<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.130> something

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
here's the powerful so I'll do something

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.300 
here's the powerful so I'll do something
like<00:03:19.040> third<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.850> sixth<00:03:21.330> string<00:03:22.190> then<00:03:23.190> I'll

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
like third on the sixth string then I'll

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.490 
like third on the sixth string then I'll
hit<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.580> second<00:03:23.970> fret<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.540> e<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
hit the second fret the e this is the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.700 
hit the second fret the e this is the
octave<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.180> fourth<00:03:27.600> string<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.260> then

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
octave on the fourth string and then

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.080 
octave on the fourth string and then
I'll<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.040> maybe<00:03:29.370> hit<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.580> top<00:03:29.850> two<00:03:30.090> strings

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I'll like maybe hit the top two strings

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.220 
I'll like maybe hit the top two strings
open<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.050> then<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> lick<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.930> put<00:03:36.110> that

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
open and then the lick so you put that

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.210 
open and then the lick so you put that
all<00:03:36.380> together<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.770> you<00:03:36.860> get<00:03:36.920> something<00:03:37.130> like

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
all together and you get something like

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:47.120 
all together and you get something like
this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.089 

ah

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.770 

and<00:03:52.280> it's<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.640> little<00:03:52.819> bit<00:03:52.970> messy<00:03:53.150> as<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.629> can

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
and it's a little bit messy as you can

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.040 
and it's a little bit messy as you can
hear<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.049> occasionally<00:03:54.470> hit<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.920> wrong<00:03:55.069> strain

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.510 

and<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.470> doesn't<00:04:02.770> really<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.160> one<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.370> those

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
and it doesn't really is one of those

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.010 
and it doesn't really is one of those
things<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.820> doesn't<00:04:03.970> have<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.450> be<00:04:04.570> perfectly

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
things that doesn't have to be perfectly

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.720 
things that doesn't have to be perfectly
clean<00:04:05.290> all<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.620> time<00:04:05.770> it's<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.400> kind<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.610> an

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
clean all the time it's it's kind of an

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.170 
clean all the time it's it's kind of an
attitude<00:04:06.940> sound<00:04:08.460> as<00:04:09.460> I<00:04:09.670> was<00:04:09.820> thinking<00:04:09.970> about

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
attitude sound as I was thinking about

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.170 
attitude sound as I was thinking about
what<00:04:10.840> other<00:04:10.870> tunes<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.470> know<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.770> use<00:04:11.890> this

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
what other tunes I know that use this

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.640 
what other tunes I know that use this
are<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.540> gonna<00:04:13.630> go<00:04:13.810> my<00:04:13.960> way<00:04:13.990> by<00:04:14.290> Lenny<00:04:14.470> Kravitz

came<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.160> mine<00:04:18.390> which<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.690> same<00:04:19.900> lick

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.670 

second<00:04:22.790> fret<00:04:22.910> on<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> fourth<00:04:23.330> string<00:04:23.680> second

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680

on<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.500> 4th<00:04:27.800> string<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.640> it's<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.880> same<00:04:29.060> idea

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
on the 4th string so it's the same idea

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:40.060 
on the 4th string so it's the same idea
but<00:04:31.510> in<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> more<00:04:32.750> rock<00:04:32.960> context<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.470> I'm<00:04:39.860> sure

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
places I know I've heard that same idea

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.890

that's<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.800> what<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:45.980> could<00:04:46.190> think<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.460> off

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
that's just what I could think of off
