the dumbbell row with remote cable look
how<00:01:49.229> much<00:01:49.380> waste<00:01:49.590> water<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> ball<00:01:50.369> I'll

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
how much waste water on this ball I'll

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.260 
how much waste water on this ball I'll
bet<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:52.939> you<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:53.970> about

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
Olivia good method the cable actually

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.950 
Olivia good method the cable actually
offers<00:02:37.000> more<00:02:37.240> resistance

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
offers more resistance

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960 
offers more resistance
okay<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> dumbbell<00:02:38.980> because<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.670> resistance

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
okay a dumbbell because the resistance

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.630 
okay a dumbbell because the resistance
is<00:02:40.270> throughout<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.750> full<00:02:41.020> range<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.440> motion

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
concentrate on to keep the variation of

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.470 
concentrate on to keep the variation of
going<00:05:52.010> but<00:05:52.580> you're<00:05:52.760> stimulating<00:05:52.940> as<00:05:53.300> much

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
going but you're stimulating as much

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.510 
going but you're stimulating as much
muscle<00:05:53.720> as<00:05:53.930> possible<00:05:53.960> because<00:05:54.890> the<00:05:55.130> back<00:05:55.340> is

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
muscle as possible because the back is

muscle as possible because the back is
really<00:05:55.730> eight<00:05:56.510> layers<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.020> muscle<00:05:57.500> they

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
really eight layers of muscle they

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.550 
really eight layers of muscle they
really<00:05:58.370> gotta<00:05:58.520> concentrate<00:05:58.910> on<00:05:59.240> getting

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
really gotta concentrate on getting

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.260 
really gotta concentrate on getting
every<00:06:00.560> layer<00:06:00.830> and<00:06:01.610> like<00:06:01.850> I<00:06:01.880> said<00:06:02.090> earlier

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
every layer and like I said earlier

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.660 
every layer and like I said earlier
every<00:06:03.080> groove<00:06:03.320> all<00:06:03.890> right<00:06:04.040> well<00:06:04.160> that's<00:06:04.250> good

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670
