00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
very difficult challenge for us to try

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
very difficult challenge for us to try
to<00:00:58.890> balance<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> game<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> result<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to balance the game as a result of that

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
to balance the game as a result of that
you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.109> Saints<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> third<00:01:01.949> we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you know when Saints for the third we

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
you know when Saints for the third we
took<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> 11<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.270> Saints<00:01:03.660> Row<00:01:03.750> 4<00:01:03.809> they

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
took it up to 11 so on Saints Row 4 they

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
took it up to 11 so on Saints Row 4 they
want<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> take<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> 13<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.760> we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
want to take it up to 13 and so we

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.700 
want to take it up to 13 and so we
really<00:01:06.479> can't<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.140> regular<00:01:07.320> gangs

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
really can't just have regular gangs

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230 
really can't just have regular gangs
even<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.159> they're<00:01:08.280> wearing<00:01:08.430> Mexican<00:01:08.909> wrestler

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
even if they're wearing Mexican wrestler

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
even if they're wearing Mexican wrestler
masks<00:01:09.600> we've<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.140> even<00:01:10.380> further<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
masks we've got to go even further so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
masks we've got to go even further so
I've<00:01:11.010> got<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> aliens<00:01:14.689> having<00:01:15.689> aliens<00:01:16.110> in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I've got the aliens having aliens in

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
I've got the aliens having aliens in
Saints<00:01:16.619> Row<00:01:16.710> 4<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.220> allowed<00:01:17.700> us<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> expand

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Saints Row 4 really allowed us to expand

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.090 
Saints Row 4 really allowed us to expand
on<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:19.049> crazy<00:01:19.320> weapons<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.830> were<00:01:19.920> known

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
on these crazy weapons that were known

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310 
on these crazy weapons that were known
for<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.479> didn't<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.780> aliens<00:01:22.200> we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
for so if we didn't have aliens we

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840 
for so if we didn't have aliens we
probably<00:01:22.560> wouldn't<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.950> able<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> black

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
probably wouldn't be able to do a black

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.080 
probably wouldn't be able to do a black
hole<00:01:24.060> guy<00:01:24.270> super<00:01:25.100> overpowered<00:01:26.100> laser<00:01:26.400> rifles

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
the inflate or a plasma rocket

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.719 
the inflate or a plasma rocket
none<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.920> would<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.280> make<00:01:31.520> sense

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
none of that would really make sense

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.260 
none of that would really make sense
without<00:01:32.090> these<00:01:32.420> aliens<00:01:33.429> good<00:01:34.429> when<00:01:34.909> designing

the<00:01:35.479> rectifier<00:01:36.109> one<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.679> our<00:01:36.829> lead<00:01:37.280> animators

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the rectifier one of our lead animators

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.300 
the rectifier one of our lead animators
had<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.509> idea<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.840> put<00:01:39.109> a<00:01:39.289> tongue<00:01:39.649> inside<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
had the idea to put a tongue inside the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.010 
had the idea to put a tongue inside the
tip<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.880> when<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.359> opens<00:01:41.630> up<00:01:41.780> there's<00:01:41.960> a

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
tip of it when it opens up there's a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.480 
tip of it when it opens up there's a
tongue<00:01:42.289> inside<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.770> that's<00:01:42.829> wiggling<00:01:43.369> all

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
tongue inside and that's wiggling all

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.249 
tongue inside and that's wiggling all
around<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.119> after<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.420> created<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.049> he

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
around so after I created that he

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.190 
around so after I created that he
animated<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.490> gross<00:01:46.880> himself<00:01:47.390> out<00:01:47.569> so<00:01:47.959> bad

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
animated it and gross himself out so bad

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.709 
animated it and gross himself out so bad
that<00:01:48.890> he<00:01:49.130> requested<00:01:49.579> that<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.060> removed<00:01:50.539> the

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
that he requested that we removed the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:59.349 
that he requested that we removed the
