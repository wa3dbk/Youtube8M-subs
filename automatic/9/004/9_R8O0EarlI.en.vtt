00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
buttons are really reactive there is no

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
buttons are really reactive there is no
problem<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.670> grip<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
problem on it there is not much grip on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
problem on it there is not much grip on
this<00:01:27.420> case<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.740> plastic

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
this case because of this plastic

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450 
this case because of this plastic
material<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.780> helps<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.710> fact<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> has

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
material it helps the fact that it has

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
material it helps the fact that it has
like<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> border<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> TPU<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.560> bottom

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
like the border of TPU and the bottom

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
like the border of TPU and the bottom
part<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.670> assists<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
part it assists you a little bit the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
part it assists you a little bit the
middle<00:01:37.500> part<00:01:37.740> being<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> matte<00:01:38.310> finish<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
middle part being a matte finish it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
middle part being a matte finish it
gives<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.720> nice<00:01:40.020> touch<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.979> look<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
gives a nice touch when you look at it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.149 
gives a nice touch when you look at it
it<00:01:42.000> also<00:01:42.270> goes<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.470> above<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> screen

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it also goes a little above the screen

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.240 
it also goes a little above the screen
however<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.240> case<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:46.049> are<00:01:46.079> using<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
however in this case we are using the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.600 
however in this case we are using the
SGP<00:01:47.670> glass<00:01:48.450> TR<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> glass<00:01:50.159> shield

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
SGP glass TR which is the glass shield

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.429 
SGP glass TR which is the glass shield
so<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> raise<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> screen<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
so that is going to raise the screen a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
so that is going to raise the screen a
little<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.430> buy<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
little bit so don't go buy this as you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.240 
little bit so don't go buy this as you
can<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:55.079> screen<00:01:55.409> show<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.009> top

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
can see the screen show is going on top

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
can see the screen show is going on top
so<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:57.060> much<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> put<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> down<00:01:58.110> if

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so pretty much when you put it down if

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
so pretty much when you put it down if
you're<00:01:58.469> using<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.100> glass<00:01:59.520> shield<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.270> not

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
going to be able to protect the screen

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.429 
going to be able to protect the screen
for<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> put<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.350> again

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
for you put it down but then again

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.100 
for you put it down but then again

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you'll be hitting the glass shield and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.010 
you'll be hitting the glass shield and
not<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.680> screen<00:02:07.920> itself<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:09.179> border<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
not the screen itself the border of it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
not the screen itself the border of it
on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.410> TPU<00:02:10.739> part<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.310> looks<00:02:11.489> very<00:02:11.700> good<00:02:11.879> on

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the front

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.110 
the front
combines<00:02:13.140> very<00:02:13.470> good<00:02:13.709> if<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.520> had<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> black

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
combines very good if you had a black

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.020 
combines very good if you had a black
iPhone<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.170> definitely<00:02:16.890> will<00:02:17.040> vanish<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.790> it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
iPhone it definitely will vanish so it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.360

will<00:02:18.180> make<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.720> seems<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.380> there<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.650> no<00:02:20.069> case

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
will make it seems that there is no case

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.180 
will make it seems that there is no case
at<00:02:20.580> all<00:02:20.810> there's<00:02:21.810> different<00:02:22.260> colors<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:23.010> this
