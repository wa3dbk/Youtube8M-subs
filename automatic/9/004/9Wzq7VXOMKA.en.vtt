really quick obviously it has less or
lesser<00:00:08.849> specs<00:00:09.150> i<00:00:09.269> should<00:00:09.420> say<00:00:09.599> than<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.670> l7

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
lesser specs i should say than the l7

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.270 
lesser specs i should say than the l7
and<00:00:11.960> it<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> shows<00:00:13.440> already<00:00:13.740> when<00:00:14.130> you're

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and it kind of shows already when you're

and it kind of shows already when you're
just<00:00:14.429> looking<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> phone<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> 4<00:00:16.109> inch

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
just looking at the phone it is a 4 inch

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.740 
just looking at the phone it is a 4 inch
display<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.730> now<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.240> 4-inch<00:00:18.570> display

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
display I for now it's a 4-inch display

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.660 
display I for now it's a 4-inch display
true<00:00:19.109> color<00:00:19.289> IPS<00:00:20.300> also<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.779> WVGA<00:00:22.320> display

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
true color IPS also with a WVGA display

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.009 
true color IPS also with a WVGA display
so<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.330> hand<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> feels<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.930> little

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
so kind of in the hand it feels a little

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.230 
so kind of in the hand it feels a little
bit<00:00:25.199> more<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.279> plastic<00:00:26.490> II<00:00:26.820> feel<00:00:27.029> rather

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
bit more like the plastic II feel rather

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.080 
bit more like the plastic II feel rather
than<00:00:27.449> my<00:00:27.660> matted<00:00:28.439> back<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> l7<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
than my matted back of the l7 it is a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.640 
than my matted back of the l7 it is a
lot<00:00:30.480> smaller<00:00:30.720> though<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.410> grip<00:00:31.619> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
lot smaller though so you can grip it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
lot smaller though so you can grip it
very<00:00:31.920> well<00:00:32.099> those<00:00:32.610> point<00:00:32.910> 3<00:00:33.120> inches<00:00:33.450> value

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
very well those point 3 inches value

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
very well those point 3 inches value
really<00:00:34.230> make<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> difference<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
really make a difference here and it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340 
really make a difference here and it's
definitely<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.360> pocketable<00:00:36.719> phone<00:00:37.020> something

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
definitely a pocketable phone something

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.569 
definitely a pocketable phone something
that<00:00:37.440> will<00:00:37.530> fit<00:00:37.559> pretty<00:00:37.829> much<00:00:37.980> any<00:00:38.160> pocket<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that will fit pretty much any pocket you

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.299 
that will fit pretty much any pocket you
have<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.960> gets<00:00:40.140> only<00:00:40.590> smaller<00:00:40.739> from<00:00:41.160> there

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
have and it gets only smaller from there

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
have and it gets only smaller from there

sturdiness<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.080> these<00:01:07.229> phones<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.799> can

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
sturdiness to these phones so you can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.230 
sturdiness to these phones so you can
really<00:01:08.250> bounce<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
really bounce this thing around you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
really bounce this thing around you
probably<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.869> any<00:01:10.049> problems<00:01:10.290> so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
probably not gonna have any problems so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.450 
probably not gonna have any problems so

this is a bit of a special version of it
though<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.869> wanted<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.229> make<00:01:21.380> sure<00:01:21.409> to

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
though and I wanted to make sure to

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
cover this one the l5 and the l3 to do

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.609 
cover this one the l5 and the l3 to do
have<00:01:25.010> versions<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:26.210> are<00:01:26.270> dual<00:01:26.810> sim<00:01:27.140> capable

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.080 
have versions that are dual sim capable
there's<00:01:28.070> actually<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.430> button<00:01:28.670> right<00:01:28.790> here<00:01:28.820> to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
there's actually a button right here to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.460 
there's actually a button right here to
be<00:01:29.180> able<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.390> switch<00:01:29.600> between<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.080> two<00:01:30.110> sinks

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
be able to switch between the two sinks

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.050 
be able to switch between the two sinks
so<00:01:31.390> we're<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.420> going<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.659> take<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.869> look<00:01:33.080> here

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
so we're just going to take a look here

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.850 
so we're just going to take a look here
first<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.180> all<00:01:35.330> obviously<00:01:35.659> we're<00:01:36.590> dealing

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
first of all obviously we're dealing

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.490 
first of all obviously we're dealing
with<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.979> very<00:01:37.070> small<00:01:37.430> 3.2<00:01:38.330> inch<00:01:38.540> display<00:01:38.930> again
