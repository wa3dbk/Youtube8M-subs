ISM<00:00:38.129> tree<00:00:38.309> now<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.910> foresight<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.360> 10

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
ISM tree now I use the foresight with 10

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.779 
ISM tree now I use the foresight with 10
out<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> 5<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> class<00:00:43.379> mod<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:44.340> flicker

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
out of 5 with the class mod then flicker

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.720

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
pretty much 100% of the time then

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
pretty much 100% of the time then
emulate<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.750> arguably<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
emulate because that's arguably the the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
emulate because that's arguably the the

friends<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.290> stuff<00:02:07.439> make<00:02:07.979> sure<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.160> have

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
friends and stuff make sure you have

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
friends and stuff make sure you have
rice<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.360> right<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.259> solo

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
rice but right now this is just a solo

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.309 
rice but right now this is just a solo
build<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.970> next<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> motions

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
build and so next we have the motions

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.489 
build and so next we have the motions
tree<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:13.859> we<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.310> again<00:02:14.939> another<00:02:15.230> +5<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:16.499 
tree which we have again another +5 and

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.319 
tree which we have again another +5 and
accelerate<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.430> even<00:02:17.549> have<00:02:17.639> more<00:02:18.030> gun

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
accelerate so we even have more gun

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.199 
accelerate so we even have more gun
damage<00:02:18.749> and<00:02:19.049> then<00:02:19.709> I'm<00:02:19.980> using<00:02:20.040> Ward<00:02:20.700> because

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
damage and then I'm using Ward because

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.229 
damage and then I'm using Ward because
again<00:02:22.079> it's<00:02:22.319> over<00:02:23.010> power<00:02:23.219> level<00:02:23.519> 8<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.060> our

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
again it's over power level 8 so our

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.239 
again it's over power level 8 so our
shields<00:02:24.719> we<00:02:24.870> want<00:02:25.079> them<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.349> up<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.889> much<00:02:26.129> as

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:26.249 
shields we want them as up as much as

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.640 
shields we want them as up as much as
possible<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:27.629> 5<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.230> suspension

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
possible and then 5 for suspension

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.559 
possible and then 5 for suspension
because<00:02:29.189> when<00:02:29.430> I'm<00:02:29.549> healing<00:02:29.969> someone<00:02:30.329> like

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
because when I'm healing someone like

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.629 
because when I'm healing someone like
phase<00:02:31.170> locks<00:02:31.469> think<00:02:31.829> switch<00:02:32.189> the<00:02:32.400> grog<00:02:32.609> nozzle

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
phase locks think switch the grog nozzle

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.699 
phase locks think switch the grog nozzle
the<00:02:33.599> longer<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.079> they're<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.379> their<00:02:34.530> phase

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
the longer that they're in their phase

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.819 
the longer that they're in their phase
lock<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.189> more<00:02:35.400> healing<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.909> get<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.560> run

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
lock the more healing I get then I run

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.159 
lock the more healing I get then I run
fleet<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.689> I'm<00:02:39.810> running<00:02:39.989> around

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:40.169 
fleet because when I'm running around

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.289 
fleet because when I'm running around
the<00:02:40.349> map<00:02:40.530> trying<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.099> go<00:02:41.189> places<00:02:41.489> or<00:02:41.879> farming

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
the map trying to go places or farming

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.000 
the map trying to go places or farming
for<00:02:42.450> weapons<00:02:42.780> I'm<00:02:43.019> using<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.439> banshee<00:02:43.680> class

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
for weapons I'm using a banshee class

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.009 
for weapons I'm using a banshee class
mod<00:02:44.249> so<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.579> can<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.359> Roughrider<00:02:45.750> shield

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
mod so I can with the Roughrider shield

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.000 
mod so I can with the Roughrider shield
so<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.560> run<00:02:46.739> around<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:47.069> lot<00:02:47.280> faster<00:02:47.780> then

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
so I can run around a lot faster then

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.500 
so I can run around a lot faster then
converge<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.609> we<00:02:50.669> can<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:50.879> all<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> enemies

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
converge so we can get all the enemies

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990 
converge so we can get all the enemies
on<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.379> playing<00:02:52.620> field<00:02:52.919> right<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.519> same<00:02:53.730> spot

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
on the playing field right the same spot

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.659 
on the playing field right the same spot
and<00:02:54.299> most<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> time<00:02:54.930> Rouen<00:02:55.680> will<00:02:55.859> slide<00:02:56.129> every

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
and most the time Rouen will slide every

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.509 
and most the time Rouen will slide every
single<00:02:56.939> one<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:58.349> five<00:02:59.310> out<00:02:59.489> of

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
single one of them and then five out of

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.909 
single one of them and then five out of
five<00:02:59.730> on<00:03:00.000> Quicken<00:03:00.389> so<00:03:00.599> we<00:03:00.719> have<00:03:00.810> more<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.829> know

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
five on Quicken so we have more you know

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.280 
five on Quicken so we have more you know
more<00:03:02.189> phase<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> lot<00:03:02.669> faster<00:03:03.269> phase<00:03:03.480> locks<00:03:03.780> but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
more phase a lot faster phase locks but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.979 
more phase a lot faster phase locks but
again<00:03:04.889> this<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.699> awesome<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.359> we<00:03:06.599> even<00:03:06.780> get

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
again this it's awesome that we even get

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.159 
again this it's awesome that we even get
more<00:03:07.139> skill<00:03:07.409> points<00:03:07.439> at<00:03:07.799> level<00:03:07.980> 72<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.169> five

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
more skill points at level 72 and five

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.890 
more skill points at level 72 and five
out<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> five<00:03:10.829> on<00:03:11.189> subsequence<00:03:11.969> so<00:03:12.299> once<00:03:12.780> we

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
out of five on subsequence so once we

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.270 
out of five on subsequence so once we
kill<00:03:13.109> one<00:03:13.290> person<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.769> our<00:03:13.829> phase<00:03:14.040> lock

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
kill one person in our phase lock

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.189 
kill one person in our phase lock
there's<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.879> hundred<00:03:15.299> percent<00:03:15.359> chance<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.959> is

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
there's a hundred percent chance that is

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.499 
there's a hundred percent chance that is
going<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.439> go<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> another<00:03:17.040> enemy<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.209> only

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:18.509 
going to go to another enemy the only

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.719 
going to go to another enemy the only
reason<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.259> will<00:03:19.470> not<00:03:19.709> run<00:03:19.949> subsequence

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
reason that I will not run subsequence

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.849 
reason that I will not run subsequence
is<00:03:20.909> if<00:03:21.269> I'm<00:03:21.389> fighting<00:03:21.599> loaders<00:03:22.169> because

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
is if I'm fighting loaders because

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.569 
is if I'm fighting loaders because
they'll<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.250> sit<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:23.879> chase<00:03:24.239> around

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
they'll just sit there and chase around

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.909 
they'll just sit there and chase around
the<00:03:26.579> repair<00:03:27.120> loaders<00:03:27.720> though<00:03:28.169> I<00:03:28.470> can't<00:03:28.799> man

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
the repair loaders though I can't man

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.140 
the repair loaders though I can't man
with<00:03:29.040> their<00:03:29.159> cold<00:03:29.340> right<00:03:29.549> now<00:03:29.579> drawing<00:03:30.060> a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
with their cold right now drawing a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.399 
with their cold right now drawing a
blank<00:03:30.359> but<00:03:30.629> yeah<00:03:30.750> that's<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.079> only<00:03:31.259> time<00:03:31.379> I

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
blank but yeah that's the only time I

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.890 
blank but yeah that's the only time I
won't<00:03:31.769> use<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.400> then<00:03:33.180> I'll<00:03:33.419> go<00:03:33.569> more<00:03:33.810> in

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
won't use it and then I'll go more in

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.530 
won't use it and then I'll go more in
the<00:03:33.989> harmony<00:03:34.290> skill<00:03:34.620> tree<00:03:34.889> for<00:03:35.489> substance<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the harmony skill tree for substance and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.749 
the harmony skill tree for substance and
elated<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.799> we<00:03:37.979> get<00:03:38.220> more<00:03:38.459> health

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:38.759 
elated so we get more health

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.939 
elated so we get more health
regeneration<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:40.169> other<00:03:40.290> than<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.889> is

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
regeneration but other than that this is

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.280 
regeneration but other than that this is
the<00:03:41.220> build<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.729> use<00:03:42.090> running<00:03:42.569> around<00:03:42.659> solo

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
the build that I use running around solo

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.009 
the build that I use running around solo
in<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:43.500> game<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.979> like<00:03:44.699> it<00:03:44.939> I<00:03:45.150> feel<00:03:45.629> like<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:45.930> a

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
in the game I like it I feel like I do a

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.469 
in the game I like it I feel like I do a
bunch<00:03:46.379> of<00:03:46.470> damage<00:03:46.859> especially<00:03:47.549> since<00:03:48.269> when

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
bunch of damage especially since when

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.860 
bunch of damage especially since when
there<00:03:48.599> slide<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.379> then<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.739> get<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:49.919> hundred<00:03:50.129> and

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
there slide and then I get a hundred and
