so<00:02:28.599> that's<00:02:28.750> iPod<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:30.760> are<00:02:30.910> three<00:02:31.360> major

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
so that's iPod there are three major

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.720 
so that's iPod there are three major
breakthroughs<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.650> iPod<00:02:32.950> let's<00:02:33.400> take<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:33.580> look

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
breakthroughs in iPod let's take a look

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.270 
breakthroughs in iPod let's take a look
at<00:02:33.819> each<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:35.019> first<00:02:35.290> one<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.650> its<00:02:35.920> ultra

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
at each one the first one is its ultra

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640 
at each one the first one is its ultra
portable<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:37.569> if<00:02:37.810> we're<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> keep<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
portable so if we're going to keep a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.369 
portable so if we're going to keep a
thousand<00:02:39.129> songs<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.700> iPod<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:41.019> fits<00:02:41.260> in

on to iPod we don't - wait so we've

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.500 
on to iPod we don't - wait so we've
built<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.169> firewire<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:45.700> Apple<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.299> you<00:03:46.389> know

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
built in firewire now Apple is you know

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.360 
built in firewire now Apple is you know
invented<00:03:46.930> firewire<00:03:47.380> we<00:03:47.620> should<00:03:47.769> firewire<00:03:48.220> on

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
invented firewire we should firewire on

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.030 
invented firewire we should firewire on
every<00:03:48.639> computer<00:03:48.970> we<00:03:49.180> make<00:03:49.419> it's<00:03:50.349> built<00:03:50.739> into

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
every computer we make it's built into

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.190 
every computer we make it's built into
iPod<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.120> first<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.630> only<00:03:52.750> music

iPod it's the first and only music
player<00:03:53.410> with<00:03:53.470> firewire<00:03:54.150> why<00:03:55.150> because<00:03:56.019> it's

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
player with firewire why because it's

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.430 
player with firewire why because it's
fast<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:57.220> can<00:03:57.430> download<00:03:57.700> an<00:03:58.030> entire<00:03:58.139> CD<00:03:59.139> in

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
fast you can download an entire CD in

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.800 
fast you can download an entire CD in
the<00:03:59.859> iPod<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.459> 5<00:04:00.669> to<00:04:00.819> 10<00:04:01.000> seconds<00:04:01.359> an<00:04:01.599> entire<00:04:02.440> CD

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
the iPod in 5 to 10 seconds an entire CD

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.909 
the iPod in 5 to 10 seconds an entire CD
so<00:04:04.810> let's<00:04:04.959> take<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.109> look<00:04:05.290> at<00:04:05.380> how<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.590> compares

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
so let's take a look at how it compares

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.530 
so let's take a look at how it compares
with<00:04:06.040> USB<00:04:07.019> 5<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.200> 10<00:04:08.380> seconds<00:04:08.970> for<00:04:09.970> firewire<00:04:10.389> to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
with USB 5 to 10 seconds for firewire to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.839 
with USB 5 to 10 seconds for firewire to
load<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> CD<00:04:11.079> on<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.470> USB<00:04:11.799> player<00:04:12.190> you're<00:04:12.519> talking

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
load a CD on a USB player you're talking

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.690 
load a CD on a USB player you're talking
5<00:04:13.060> minutes<00:04:13.709> let's<00:04:14.709> talk<00:04:14.859> about<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.099> thousand

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
5 minutes let's talk about a thousand

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.110 
5 minutes let's talk about a thousand
songs<00:04:15.910> now<00:04:16.320> an<00:04:17.320> iPod<00:04:18.099> with<00:04:18.310> firewire<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:19.030> is

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
songs now an iPod with firewire it is

ever shipped and you can recharge this
10<00:05:09.070> hour<00:05:09.190> battery<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.820> one<00:05:10.150> hour<00:05:10.390> to<00:05:10.720> 80%<00:05:11.440> of

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
10 hour battery in one hour to 80% of

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.290 
10 hour battery in one hour to 80% of
its<00:05:11.620> capacity<00:05:11.740> on<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.400> fast<00:05:12.730> charge<00:05:13.440> one<00:05:14.440> hour

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
its capacity on a fast charge one hour

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.420 
its capacity on a fast charge one hour
but<00:05:16.300> maybe<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.780> coolest<00:05:17.320> thing<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:18.130> that<00:05:18.190> you

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
but maybe the coolest thing is that you

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.760 
but maybe the coolest thing is that you
know<00:05:18.520> firewire<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.270> firewire<00:05:19.750> cable<00:05:20.260> carries

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
know firewire the firewire cable carries

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.610 
know firewire the firewire cable carries
all<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.010> data<00:05:21.250> from<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.880> Mac<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.630> iPod<00:05:23.020> the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
all the data from the Mac to iPod the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.400 
all the data from the Mac to iPod the
firewire<00:05:24.130> also<00:05:24.490> has<00:05:24.580> power<00:05:24.910> on<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.420> and<00:05:25.630> so

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
firewire also has power on it and so

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.210 
firewire also has power on it and so
when<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.160> plug<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:28.300> your<00:05:28.420> Mac<00:05:28.680> it<00:05:29.680> actually

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
when you plug in to your Mac it actually

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.820 
when you plug in to your Mac it actually
charges<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:30.910> iPod<00:05:31.450> over<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.230> single

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
charges the iPod over that single

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.880 
charges the iPod over that single
firewire<00:05:33.640> cable<00:05:34.210> so<00:05:35.170> you<00:05:35.230> don't<00:05:35.380> have<00:05:35.560> another

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
firewire cable so you don't have another

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.460 
firewire cable so you don't have another
charging<00:05:36.760> cable<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.270> worry<00:05:37.450> about<00:05:37.720> it<00:05:37.870> charges

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
charging cable to worry about it charges

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.800 
charging cable to worry about it charges
over<00:05:38.650> firewire<00:05:39.180> every<00:05:40.180> time<00:05:40.390> you<00:05:40.480> plug<00:05:40.660> in

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
over firewire every time you plug in

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.480 
over firewire every time you plug in
your<00:05:40.900> map<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.320> might<00:05:41.440> say<00:05:41.590> well<00:05:41.770> what<00:05:42.460> happens

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
your map you might say well what happens

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.150 
your map you might say well what happens
