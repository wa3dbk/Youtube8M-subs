00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hello everyone today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:08.970
 the highly anticipated 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.530
 it was very design esad ribic transatlantic were at 15 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.059
 of 5 6% with his voice high 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.380
 two pianos 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 with 6 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.339
 2nd 4-4 in power and 4 12 and this apparent amplification 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.920
 the first channel devolved rather to sanctuaries the three operate according to 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.410
 normal christophe booster it carries before them 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.410
 graham band equalization 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 which stretches to attenuate the power of the canal 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.860
 born like that of the other channel with the extension 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.800
 but it was thibault of saint vincent 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.809
 at 15 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.920
 after 25 years of absence this year to this help 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.800
 the last ballot 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.150
 here allows to 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
 the channel swapped when we have no foot switch 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.440
 6 go believe 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.820
 second channel this second channel him and more 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.580
 6 devolved 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.790
 a bit more 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.980
 with a little more 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.130
 2 of great art 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.430
 and so they can chain on the 3-2 all empty 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
 h a small ali see 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.270
 so for saturations 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.110
 deep 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.440
 we will first listen 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 the channel m 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 you 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410
 here 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.040
 our teaching 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 we dig a little more 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.930
 hold the sea 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.920
 so we can as I told tignes 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880
 vim of the channel pulling the masters would have cost that l 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.209
 % 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.190
 I rest 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.379
 world 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.419
 we see that even a good difference 2 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.689
 we'll have to see what happens next 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.689
 five times reached m 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.809
 15-15 world 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.980
 twenty-five meters herself beautiful races 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.319
 we pass on the goal 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
 of the first channel so that standing mode 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.219
 she 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.279
 to go 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.459
 but 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 trouble 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.639
 launched by the way reviewed my blog 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 really grown up he's very strong 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:24.909
 by passing the 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.700
 the channel 2 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.869
 the p begins with the wind 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.219
 of all leaders 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.059
 kevin garn not too pushed 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:32.709
 1 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.459
 even my 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.799
 yes percentage 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:42.249
 I push a little well 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.249
 she 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.589
 so now we will switch to iphone mode 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.459
 note that this version 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.459
 more posed with more rage 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 she 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.509
 and now we go to 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.439
 two years from that we are really 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.529
 in the right way 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.529
 the most of this human race 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.099
 as on the other channel we can play the best that attracts you so there we will 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.099
 put to his right to start 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.270
 exceeding 15 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.270
 so 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.819
 at 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.539
 then by 25 voices alsace 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.770
 so 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.580
 to be quite complete point out 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.660
 so that this vice will hook up on a 4 August boat or on a boat 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.389
 mythos you saw during this test besides being really very beautiful this 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.539
 effort abounds with brief possibilities an amp that I recommend on this game I 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.010
 greet you well
