00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.660
 to make the shape steal in the house there 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.090
 two simple ingredients are needed 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 transparent silicone that you find at 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.960
 brico the cost is about 3 euros and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.540
 cornstarch or cornstarch found at 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 supermarket in the flour and ha section 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.000
 a cost of about one euro fifty 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.320
 let's start by measuring the two ingredients with 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.530
 a balance their ratio is 1 to 1 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.260
 that is, the quantities must be equal to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.050
 example I will use 30 grams of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050
 cornstarch and 30 grams of silicone 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.450
 we mix the mixture 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.890
 and when it will be quite compact 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.750
 we work with our hands to eliminate the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.750
 lumps and make it smooth 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.280
 therefore we choose the object of which 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.760
 we want the mold and insert it into the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760
 pasta 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.280
 working the edges to avoid it 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.280
 bolt suffered by the object 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.340
 we can leave for 24 hours we can 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.740
 remove the objects from the mold that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:03:05.590
 as you can see it is soft and does not create 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:03:09.150
 problems in the operation and now 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.150
 let's try it with dolphin 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.890
 as you can see the details are extremely 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.890
 alive 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.799
 then all you have to do is indulge yourself with 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.799
 the molds for your creations 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.990
 I hope you enjoyed them next time
