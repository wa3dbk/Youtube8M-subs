00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
not sure if they took it out of the game

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.039 
not sure if they took it out of the game
or<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.920> press<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.420> different<00:01:48.420> combination<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
buttons so we'll have to see there the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330 
buttons so we'll have to see there the
shooting<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> lot<00:01:52.500> better<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.070> ball

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
shooting is just a lot better the ball

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.889 
shooting is just a lot better the ball
feels<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:54.090> weight<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> know

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
feels like it has weight if you know

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
feels like it has weight if you know
what<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.049> mean<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.380> doesn't<00:01:55.740> seem<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
what I mean it doesn't seem like if you

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.999 
what I mean it doesn't seem like if you
kick<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.790> from<00:01:57.090> 40<00:01:58.079> yards<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.860> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
kick it from 40 yards out that it's just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.940 
kick it from 40 yards out that it's just
sores<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> just<00:02:00.570> speeds<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.290> goal<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
sores and just speeds to the goal or to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.069 
sores and just speeds to the goal or to
the<00:02:01.979> net<00:02:02.189> anymore<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> has<00:02:02.850> some<00:02:03.390> nice<00:02:03.630> weight

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the net anymore it has some nice weight

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.810 
the net anymore it has some nice weight
to<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.740> floats<00:02:05.219> through<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> air

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to it and it just floats through the air

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.760 
to it and it just floats through the air
as<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> shoot<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:06.810> always<00:02:07.049> good

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
as you shoot it so that's always good

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.040 
as you shoot it so that's always good

difficult<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.910> defend<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.360> actually<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.930> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
difficult to defend I actually like that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 
difficult to defend I actually like that
because<00:02:43.410> now<00:02:43.769> everyone's<00:02:44.700> gonna<00:02:44.849> kind<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.239> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
going to be able to go off on a couple

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.699 
going to be able to go off on a couple
of<00:02:53.430> skill<00:02:53.819> runs<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.660> feels<00:02:55.200> like<00:02:55.319> EA

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
of skill runs but just feels like EA

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.160 
of skill runs but just feels like EA
took<00:02:56.160> off<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.910> many<00:02:57.060> people's<00:02:57.480> four-star<00:02:58.019> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
took off so many people's four-star and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.930 
took off so many people's four-star and
five-star<00:02:58.590> skills<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.519> list<00:02:59.760> is

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
five-star skills it's the list is

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.880 
five-star skills it's the list is
getting<00:03:00.120> smaller<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.750> smaller<00:03:00.810> every<00:03:01.410> year<00:03:01.440> I

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
getting smaller and smaller every year I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.920 
getting smaller and smaller every year I
think<00:03:02.310> Ben<00:03:02.519> Arfa<00:03:02.849> even<00:03:03.090> lost<00:03:03.239> his<00:03:03.480> five-star

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930

they don't just paste down the wings and
cross<00:03:44.160> or<00:03:44.579> they<00:03:44.670> don't<00:03:44.819> just<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:45.060> over<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.389> top

what's<00:03:50.010> going<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.400> really<00:03:50.849> good<00:03:50.880> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
what's going to be really good and

what's going to be really good and
what's<00:03:51.870> going<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.109> be<00:03:52.260> really<00:03:52.769> bad<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.340> I

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
what's going to be really bad and I

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.009 
what's going to be really bad and I
think<00:03:54.060> that's<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.359> going<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.630> take<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> lot

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
it just really really is fine-tuned like

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.900 
it just really really is fine-tuned like
I<00:04:06.950> said<00:04:07.130> in<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.220> beginning<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.580> video

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
I said in the beginning this video

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.850 
I said in the beginning this video
everything<00:04:08.270> seems<00:04:08.720> fine<00:04:08.840> tune<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.440> actually

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
everything seems fine tune it actually

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.880 
everything seems fine tune it actually
feels<00:04:10.070> like<00:04:10.430> they<00:04:11.380> finished<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.530> lot<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.800> the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
feels like they finished a lot of the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.320 
feels like they finished a lot of the
stuff<00:04:13.160> they<00:04:13.340> wanted<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.850> throughout<00:04:14.150> the

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
stuff they wanted to throughout the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.060 
stuff they wanted to throughout the
course<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.750> years<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.290> adding<00:04:15.830> stuff

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
course of the years of adding stuff

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.710 
course of the years of adding stuff
together<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:16.730> think<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.209> year

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
together and I think this year

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.229 
together and I think this year
everything<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:18.830> comes<00:04:19.190> together<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:20.030> just

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
everything just comes together and just

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.740 
everything just comes together and just
plays<00:04:20.690> really<00:04:21.230> really<00:04:21.500> well<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:23.270> know<00:04:23.420> if

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.450 
plays really really well so you know if
