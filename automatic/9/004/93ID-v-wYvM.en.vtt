through a few of the main points to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in the world of HD there are three main

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.860 
in the world of HD there are three main
resolutions<00:00:37.770> 7<00:00:38.520> ATP<00:00:39.080> 1080i<00:00:40.080> and<00:00:40.530> 1080p

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
resolutions 7 ATP 1080i and 1080p
resolution<00:00:42.870> means<00:00:43.050> level<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> detail<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
resolution means level of detail and the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.280 
resolution means level of detail and the
number<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:44.970> refers<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.840> number<00:00:45.870> of

number actually refers to the number of

contrast<00:00:49.080> standard<00:00:49.769> definition<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.489> only<00:00:50.670> 480

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
contrast standard definition is only 480

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.689 
contrast standard definition is only 480
so<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.260> talking<00:00:52.410> about<00:00:52.650> a<00:00:52.800> big<00:00:53.160> jump<00:00:53.550> in

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so we're talking about a big jump in

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.110 
so we're talking about a big jump in
clarity<00:00:54.150> in<00:00:54.989> general<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.739> bigger<00:00:56.519> number<00:00:56.790> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
clarity in general a bigger number is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.750 
clarity in general a bigger number is
better<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.600> P<00:00:58.290> is<00:00:58.620> better<00:00:58.890> than<00:00:59.040> I<00:00:59.190> why

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
better and P is better than I why

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.210 
better and P is better than I why
because<00:01:00.570> P<00:01:00.900> stands<00:01:01.290> for<00:01:01.410> progressive<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
because P stands for progressive and

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.160 
because P stands for progressive and
progressive<00:01:02.730> output<00:01:03.150> makes<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.570> fast<00:01:03.839> motion

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
progressive output makes the fast motion

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.130 
progressive output makes the fast motion
in<00:01:04.410> sports<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.100> games<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.610> action<00:01:05.910> movies
