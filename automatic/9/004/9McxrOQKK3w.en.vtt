00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:16.920 

I<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:14.830> what<00:00:15.070> we<00:00:15.219> try<00:00:15.250> and<00:00:15.699> do<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:15.940> to<00:00:16.600> write

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
I think what we try and do is to write

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.349 
I think what we try and do is to write
in<00:00:17.289> a<00:00:17.410> way<00:00:17.439> that's<00:00:17.919> both<00:00:18.160> informative<00:00:18.910> but

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
in a way that's both informative but

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.630 
in a way that's both informative but
also<00:00:19.630> that<00:00:19.929> really<00:00:20.140> touches<00:00:20.710> people<00:00:21.160> as<00:00:21.400> we're

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640

it is going to be a two-way process we

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
are going to help the foundation develop

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.670 
are going to help the foundation develop
some<00:02:57.670> activities<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.330> be<00:02:58.780> used<00:02:59.050> at<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.530> new

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
some activities to be used at the new

some activities to be used at the new
poutine<00:03:00.069> center<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:02.050> are<00:03:02.080> going<00:03:02.560> to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
poutine center and we are going to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.920 
poutine center and we are going to
observe<00:03:02.980> what<00:03:03.760> happens<00:03:03.790> when<00:03:04.390> people<00:03:04.510> start

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
observe what happens when people start

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.180 
observe what happens when people start
using<00:03:05.200> these<00:03:05.530> activities<00:03:06.160> in<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.459> center<00:03:07.050> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
using these activities in the center and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:22.240 
using these activities in the center and
learn<00:03:09.190> from<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.150> process<00:03:10.360> ourselves<00:03:10.840> too
