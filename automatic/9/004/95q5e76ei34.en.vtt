well<00:00:14.040> with<00:00:14.220> chromatic<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.940> think<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.750> biggest

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
well with chromatic I think the biggest

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.700 
well with chromatic I think the biggest
success<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.860> it<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.810> has<00:00:19.560> no

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
success with it is is that it has no

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.670 
success with it is is that it has no
ammonia<00:00:20.040> in<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.820> has<00:00:21.150> no<00:00:21.360> odor<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.110> so

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
ammonia in it it has no odor to it so

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
ammonia in it it has no odor to it so

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
relaxing experience more high-end

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.160 
relaxing experience more high-end
experience<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.600> they're<00:00:30.780> coming<00:00:31.050> in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
experience that they're coming in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
experience that they're coming in
there's<00:00:31.380> no<00:00:31.500> strong<00:00:31.800> smell<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.430> another

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
there's no strong smell and another
thing<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.690> they're<00:00:34.140> realizing<00:00:34.620> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
thing is that they're realizing that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
thing is that they're realizing that
there's<00:00:34.890> no<00:00:35.040> staining<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> could<00:00:36.660> come<00:00:36.840> on

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
there's no staining so you could come on

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
there's no staining so you could come on
your<00:00:37.140> lunch<00:00:37.350> break<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:37.949> get<00:00:38.220> your<00:00:38.430> color<00:00:38.610> done

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
your lunch break and get your color done

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
your lunch break and get your color done
and<00:00:38.970> go<00:00:39.030> back<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> work<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.960> no<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.170> would

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and go back to work and no one would

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.479 
and go back to work and no one would
ever<00:00:40.470> know<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> had<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.130> color<00:00:41.280> done

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
ever know that you had your color done

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.770 
ever know that you had your color done
it's<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.870> great<00:00:43.140> tribute<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.760 

I<00:00:51.730> think<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:52.910> serves<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.480> different<00:00:54.110> client

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
I think it serves a different client

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.700 
I think it serves a different client
like<00:00:55.730> color<00:00:55.940> fusion<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.780> in<00:00:57.140> America<00:00:57.500> color

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
like color fusion and in America color

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.400 
like color fusion and in America color
gels<00:00:58.039> they<00:00:58.940> are<00:00:59.030> all<00:00:59.149> fantastic<00:00:59.449> products<00:01:00.290> and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
gels they are all fantastic products and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.439 
gels they are all fantastic products and
they're<00:01:00.500> all<00:01:00.680> for<00:01:00.980> certain<00:01:01.460> types<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:01.910> clients

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
they're all for certain types of clients

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.240 
they're all for certain types of clients
but<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:02.989> think<00:01:03.230> what<00:01:03.350> we<00:01:03.440> see<00:01:03.620> from<00:01:03.710> chromatics

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
but I think what we see from chromatics

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.690 
but I think what we see from chromatics
is<00:01:04.369> we<00:01:04.489> are<00:01:04.610> seeing<00:01:04.790> 100%<00:01:05.690> gray<00:01:05.930> coverage

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
is we are seeing 100% gray coverage

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.399 
is we are seeing 100% gray coverage
which<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:08.090> know<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.420> challenge<00:01:08.930> so

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
which we know is a challenge so

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.990 
which we know is a challenge so
chromatics<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.009> delivering<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.700> we're

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
chromatics is delivering that we're

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.389 
chromatics is delivering that we're
seeing<00:01:11.210> beautiful<00:01:11.780> reflection<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.649> I<00:01:13.159> think

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
seeing beautiful reflection and I think

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.969 
seeing beautiful reflection and I think
the<00:01:13.880> biggest<00:01:14.149> sell<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.409> hair<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.710> two

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the biggest sell is that the hair is two

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.039 
the biggest sell is that the hair is two
times<00:01:16.280> fortified<00:01:17.030> which<00:01:17.540> is<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.840> big

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
times fortified which is the big

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.780 
times fortified which is the big
difference<00:01:18.229> from<00:01:18.619> our<00:01:18.770> other<00:01:18.979> color<00:01:19.280> lines<00:01:19.549> as

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
difference from our other color lines as

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.940 
difference from our other color lines as
the<00:01:19.909> fifth-year<00:01:20.210> will<00:01:20.450> actually<00:01:20.860> keep<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
the fifth-year will actually keep the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.380 
the fifth-year will actually keep the
integrity<00:01:22.660> during<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.720> coloring<00:01:24.080> process

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.510 

my<00:01:32.200> favorite<00:01:32.500> part<00:01:32.710> which<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:32.920> create<00:01:33.220> Cindy

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
my favorite part which I create Cindy

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.820 
my favorite part which I create Cindy
now<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.090> clear<00:01:34.390> shade<00:01:34.810> we<00:01:35.470> have<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> clear

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
now is the clear shade we have a clear

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.350 
now is the clear shade we have a clear
shade<00:01:36.190> now<00:01:36.340> which<00:01:36.550> we<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.850> not<00:01:37.030> had<00:01:37.330> before

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
shade now which we have not had before

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.440 
shade now which we have not had before
in<00:01:37.960> our<00:01:38.080> Redken<00:01:38.620> family<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.250> we<00:01:40.090> used<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.420> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
in our Redken family and we used it a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.640 
in our Redken family and we used it a
lot<00:01:40.660> in<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.840> show<00:01:40.990> here<00:01:41.200> at<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.350> latin-american

symposium and it was it's amazing the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.050 
symposium and it was it's amazing the
power<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.370> do<00:01:45.580> we<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:45.730> haven't

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
power that it can do we just haven't

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.310 
power that it can do we just haven't
seen<00:01:46.150> anything<00:01:46.570> like<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.900> from<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.110> color

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
seen anything like that from a color

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.290 
seen anything like that from a color
line<00:01:47.560> before<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.310> ability<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.730> move<00:01:48.970> color

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
line before the ability to move color

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.800 
line before the ability to move color
but<00:01:49.510> yet<00:01:49.720> fortify<00:01:50.290> yet<00:01:50.590> give<00:01:50.770> high<00:01:51.100> shine

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
but yet fortify yet give high shine

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.060 
but yet fortify yet give high shine
beautiful<00:01:52.810> results

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.860 

we<00:02:00.520> are<00:02:00.670> seeing<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:01.000> lot<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.390> ombre

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
we are seeing a lot of that ombre

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.160 
we are seeing a lot of that ombre
technique<00:02:02.170> which<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.640> natural<00:02:04.390> base<00:02:04.870> or

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
technique which is the natural base or

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.840 
technique which is the natural base or
darker<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.040> then<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.340> out<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.700> light

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
darker and then going out to the light

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.160 
darker and then going out to the light
on<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.090> ends<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:07.870> think<00:02:08.020> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
on the ends the one I think that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.440 
on the ends the one I think that
Jennifer<00:02:08.560> Aniston<00:02:08.680> started<00:02:09.340> years<00:02:09.550> ago<00:02:09.670> but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
Jennifer Aniston started years ago but

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.820 
Jennifer Aniston started years ago but
we<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.869> caught<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.350> we're<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.560> oh<00:02:11.680> that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
we just caught on and we're like oh that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.260 
we just caught on and we're like oh that
it's<00:02:11.980> pretty<00:02:12.190> cool<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.550> not<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.970> roots

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
it's pretty cool it's not just roots

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.590 
it's pretty cool it's not just roots
