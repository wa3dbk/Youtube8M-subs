 go to our internet browser in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.219

 main 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 we go all the way down 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.920
 second poggino 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.270
 this will be our hoc package like 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.619
 you see it's the rubik's pvp showcase and that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.369
 precisely a package of hoc where there are 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.900
 mainly things for bbb 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:17.820

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:31.079

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.259
 which however is not very heavy and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.799
 as soon as it ends, it will finish downloading it 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.799
