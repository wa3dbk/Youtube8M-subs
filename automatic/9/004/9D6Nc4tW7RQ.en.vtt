informs<00:02:37.490> away<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.820> like<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:37.940> did<00:02:38.150> Gary<00:02:38.330> Cooper

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
informs away that like I did Gary Cooper

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.910 
informs away that like I did Gary Cooper
are<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.930> better<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.260> pick<00:02:39.380> up<00:02:39.500> normal<00:02:39.770> Gary

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
are you better to pick up normal Gary

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.740 
are you better to pick up normal Gary
Cooper<00:02:40.160> or<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.700> stair<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> informant<00:02:41.540> or<00:02:41.630> one

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
Cooper or the stair the informant or one

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.200 
Cooper or the stair the informant or one
or<00:02:41.780> something<00:02:42.020> like<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.290> was<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.620> anyway

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
or something like that it was but anyway

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.280 
or something like that it was but anyway
so<00:02:44.210> that's<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.510> if<00:02:44.630> you'd<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.990> see<00:02:45.140> that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
so that's that if you'd like to see that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.140 
so that's that if you'd like to see that
I<00:02:45.350> know<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.680> 9<00:02:46.280> skills<00:02:46.580> does<00:02:46.760> something<00:02:47.030> similar

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
I know a 9 skills does something similar

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.940 
I know a 9 skills does something similar
so<00:02:47.330> people<00:02:47.750> are<00:02:47.840> probably<00:02:47.960> go<00:02:48.170> mental<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.650> if

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
so people are probably go mental and if

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.170 
so people are probably go mental and if
you<00:02:49.100> draw<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.400> Isan<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.790> bit<00:02:49.940> more<00:02:50.090> original

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
you draw this Isan a bit more original

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.090 
you draw this Isan a bit more original
than<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.110> these<00:02:51.230> next<00:02:51.650> two<00:02:51.740> CDs

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
than that is what these next two CDs

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.130 
than that is what these next two CDs
ideas<00:02:52.460> are<00:02:52.640> about<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.150> let<00:02:53.270> me<00:02:53.420> know<00:02:53.450> which

stuff like that everyone loves a bit of

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.510 
stuff like that everyone loves a bit of
rage<00:03:08.420> come<00:03:08.690> with<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.990> thus<00:03:09.280> proper<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
rage come with it thus proper on the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.220 
rage come with it thus proper on the
line<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:10.970> match<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.660> sit<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:11.960> there<00:03:12.200> and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
line in the match you sit in there and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.140 
line in the match you sit in there and
it's<00:03:12.560> all<00:03:12.650> tense<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.250> show<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.880> stuff<00:03:14.030> like

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
it's all tense and show and stuff like

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.850 
it's all tense and show and stuff like
that<00:03:14.210> so<00:03:14.480> obviously<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.990> would<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.680> do

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
that so obviously I would like to do

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.990 
that so obviously I would like to do
something<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.520> involve<00:03:16.790> wager

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
something like that and involve wager

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.670 
something like that and involve wager
matches<00:03:17.210> but<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.480> thought<00:03:17.660> spice<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
matches but I thought spice it up a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.990 
matches but I thought spice it up a
little<00:03:18.800> bit<00:03:18.890> make<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.340> bit<00:03:19.490> different<00:03:19.850> and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
little bit make it a bit different and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.400 
little bit make it a bit different and
double<00:03:20.240> your<00:03:20.360> money<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:21.200> wager

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
double your money it's just wager

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.110 
double your money it's just wager
matches<00:03:21.710> but<00:03:21.950> with<00:03:22.070> double<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.460> odds<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:22.940> if

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
matches but with double the odds so if

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.330 
matches but with double the odds so if
you<00:03:23.240> wage<00:03:23.450> me<00:03:23.630> 100k<00:03:24.020> if<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.620> win<00:03:24.890> I'll<00:03:25.130> give

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
you wage me 100k if you win I'll give

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.820 
you wage me 100k if you win I'll give
you<00:03:25.400> 200<00:03:26.300> k<00:03:26.420> instead<00:03:26.630> but<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.500> lose<00:03:27.650> you

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
you 200 k instead but if you lose you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.900 
you 200 k instead but if you lose you
and<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.160> give<00:03:28.280> me<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> hundred<00:03:28.640> so

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and you have to give me a hundred so

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.810 
and you have to give me a hundred so
puts<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.660> bit<00:03:29.810> more<00:03:29.960> pressure<00:03:30.170> on<00:03:30.350> me<00:03:30.730> makes<00:03:31.730> it

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
puts a bit more pressure on me makes it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.130 
puts a bit more pressure on me makes it
a<00:03:31.910> bit<00:03:32.030> more<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.240> an<00:03:32.330> interesting<00:03:32.750> video<00:03:32.870> I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
a bit more of an interesting video I

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.900 
a bit more of an interesting video I

closer<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.330> you've<00:03:53.630> basically<00:03:53.780> got

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
closer to you and you've basically got

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.500 
closer to you and you've basically got
to<00:03:54.230> get<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.950> home<00:03:55.160> bit<00:03:55.400> before<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.150> chaser

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
to get to the home bit before the chaser

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.980 
to get to the home bit before the chaser
overtakes<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:58.130> my<00:03:58.459> idea<00:03:58.610> behind<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.480> for

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
overtakes you so my idea behind this for

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.990 
overtakes you so my idea behind this for
with<00:04:00.290> FIFA<00:04:00.740> was<00:04:00.980> basically<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.580> implement

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
with FIFA was basically to implement

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.090 
with FIFA was basically to implement
this<00:04:02.150> but<00:04:02.420> with<00:04:02.540> games<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.620> obviously<00:04:03.950> I'll

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
this but with games so obviously I'll

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.340 
this but with games so obviously I'll
start<00:04:04.370> on<00:04:04.520> 0<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.600> can<00:04:05.750> choose<00:04:05.959> where<00:04:06.320> you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
start on 0 and you can choose where you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.780 
start on 0 and you can choose where you
start<00:04:06.620> with<00:04:06.740> you<00:04:06.860> start<00:04:07.070> on<00:04:07.190> one<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.700> you

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
start with you start on one and you

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.330 
start with you start on one and you
might<00:04:07.910> win<00:04:08.090> 100<00:04:09.020> k<00:04:09.140> whether<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.709> start<00:04:09.950> on<00:04:10.100> two

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
might win 100 k whether you start on two

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.400 
might win 100 k whether you start on two
games<00:04:10.610> ahead<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.060> you'll<00:04:11.300> win<00:04:11.450> 50<00:04:11.810> K<00:04:11.930> whether

only one game head start and maybe I'll
say<00:04:37.290> this<00:04:37.440> one<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.770> 200k<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.490> obviously<00:04:39.000> the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
say this one to 200k and obviously the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.700 
say this one to 200k and obviously the
prices<00:04:39.540> can<00:04:39.660> vary<00:04:39.720> depends<00:04:40.260> on<00:04:40.320> how<00:04:40.410> much<00:04:40.560> you

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
prices can vary depends on how much you

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.830 
prices can vary depends on how much you
want<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.920> wager<00:04:41.100> how<00:04:42.090> much<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.330> wanna<00:04:42.600> win

if you won't have to pay me anything if

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.600 
if you won't have to pay me anything if
you<00:04:46.110> don't<00:04:46.320> do<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.470> I'll<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.250> giving<00:04:47.370> you

his coins if you manage to get to the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.130 
his coins if you manage to get to the
end<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.940> was<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.600> a<00:04:51.870> little<00:04:51.990> bit

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
end so that was I think a little bit

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.840 
end so that was I think a little bit
something<00:04:52.470> quite<00:04:52.740> interesting<00:04:53.040> obviously<00:04:53.730> in

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
something quite interesting obviously in

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.120 
something quite interesting obviously in
an<00:04:53.940> episode<00:04:54.180> if<00:04:54.510> someone<00:04:55.290> gets<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.650> three-game

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
an episode if someone gets a three-game

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.830 
an episode if someone gets a three-game
head<00:04:56.310> start<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:57.000> just<00:04:57.090> put<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.480> two<00:04:57.630> games

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
head start and just put the two games

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.210 
head start and just put the two games
that<00:04:57.930> there<00:04:58.140> might<00:04:58.260> win<00:04:58.500> or<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.800> four<00:04:58.980> games

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that there might win or the four games

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.830 
that there might win or the four games
or<00:04:59.370> whatever<00:04:59.460> it's<00:04:59.730> going<00:04:59.850> to<00:04:59.970> be<00:05:00.060> for<00:05:00.720> me<00:05:00.810> to

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
or whatever it's going to be for me to

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.720 
or whatever it's going to be for me to
catch<00:05:01.110> up<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.470> them<00:05:01.560> but<00:05:02.100> obviously<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.610> if

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
catch up to them but obviously if if

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.860 
catch up to them but obviously if if
they<00:05:02.850> start<00:05:03.090> if<00:05:03.210> they're<00:05:03.360> really<00:05:03.630> good<00:05:03.750> at

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
they start if they're really good at

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.630 
they start if they're really good at
FIFA<00:05:03.990> only<00:05:04.320> start<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.740> one<00:05:04.920> game<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.340> it's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
FIFA only start on one game and it's

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.950 
FIFA only start on one game and it's
like<00:05:05.760> backwards<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.270> forwards<00:05:06.630> over<00:05:06.720> who

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
like backwards and forwards over who

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.240 
like backwards and forwards over who
wins<00:05:07.170> we<00:05:07.350> might<00:05:07.470> have<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.680> split<00:05:07.830> up<00:05:07.890> to<00:05:08.130> two

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
wins we might have to split up to two

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.190
