kit<00:00:10.019> for<00:00:10.230> suit<00:00:10.410> making<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.420> everyone<00:00:12.420> should

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
kit for suit making and everyone should

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.459 
kit for suit making and everyone should
really<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:13.049> one

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
really have one

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.129 
really have one
but<00:00:13.980> then<00:00:14.160> food<00:00:14.880> processors<00:00:15.480> are<00:00:15.599> also<00:00:15.750> really

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
but then food processors are also really

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.980 
but then food processors are also really
really<00:00:16.800> useful<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.180> beauty<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.630> product

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
really useful the beauty of this product

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.590 
really useful the beauty of this product
is<00:00:19.140> its<00:00:20.000> because<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.119> don't<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.300> extra

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
is its because we don't have extra

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.470 
is its because we don't have extra
motors<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.289> use<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> motor<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.480> hand

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
motors we can use the motor of the hand

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.210 
motors we can use the motor of the hand
blender<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.050> power<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.769> means<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
blender to power this so it means the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
blender to power this so it means the
products<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> lot<00:00:26.760> lot<00:00:26.939> smaller<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.439> run
