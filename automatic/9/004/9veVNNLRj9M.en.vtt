all<00:00:01.380> right<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.560> guess<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.740> base<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:01.920> our

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
all right so guess the base of our

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.470 
all right so guess the base of our
country<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:02.970> know<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.330> ready

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
country and I know this is ready

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.030 
country and I know this is ready
stuffing<00:00:03.810> now<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:04.529> don't<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.770> add<00:00:04.920> this

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
stuffing now you don't have to add this

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.559 
stuffing now you don't have to add this
I<00:00:05.220> think<00:00:05.609> they<00:00:05.670> look<00:00:05.850> better<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.390> lot<00:00:06.509> of

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I think they look better and a lot of

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.460 
I think they look better and a lot of
functions<00:00:06.810> having<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.140> them<00:00:07.259> do<00:00:07.350> them

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
functions having on all them do them

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.560 
functions having on all them do them
it's<00:00:08.250> an<00:00:08.309> extra<00:00:08.550> beauty<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.330> palms

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
it's an extra beauty of the palms

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.990 
it's an extra beauty of the palms
beliefs<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.800> start<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.070> adding<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
beliefs and I start by adding the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.680 
beliefs and I start by adding the
sticker<00:00:12.710> which<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> line<00:00:14.070> pretty<00:00:14.309> much

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
sticker which is just a line pretty much

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.070 
sticker which is just a line pretty much
which<00:00:15.690> curves

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
which curves

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.359 
which curves
now<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.650> occur<00:00:16.890> about<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.130> far<00:00:17.250> as<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
now you can occur about as far as you

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.480 
now you can occur about as far as you
want<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.890> kind<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> make<00:00:20.010> him<00:00:20.130> go<00:00:20.220> out

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.889 
down and like that so I start by just
adding<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> few<00:00:42.390> lines<00:00:44.510> just<00:00:45.510> saying<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
adding in a few lines just saying I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.090 
adding in a few lines just saying I
don't<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> look<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:49.920> good<00:00:50.039> enough

don't like to look so that's good enough

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.240 
don't like to look so that's good enough
I<00:00:50.399> tried<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> configure<00:00:51.120> at<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> bottom<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
I tried to configure at the bottom and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
I tried to configure at the bottom and
soon<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.879> alright<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
soon as they go out alright so now you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
soon as they go out alright so now you
can<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.829> individual<00:00:56.160> leaves<00:00:56.250> there's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
can have the individual leaves there's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.459 
can have the individual leaves there's
quite<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> few<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.320> tedious

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
quite a few of them kind of it's tedious

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
quite a few of them kind of it's tedious
but<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.309> too<00:00:59.399> bad<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.059> gotta

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
but it's not too bad you just gotta

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.319 
but it's not too bad you just gotta
start<00:01:00.449> Draghi's<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> lines<00:01:02.149> make<00:01:03.149> sure<00:01:03.239> they

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
start Draghi's the lines make sure they

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
start Draghi's the lines make sure they
look<00:01:03.420> somewhat<00:01:04.199> natural<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.650> no<00:01:05.489> I'm

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
look somewhat natural you know no I'm

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.080 
look somewhat natural you know no I'm
going<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.090> kinds<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> crazy<00:01:06.510> directions<00:01:08.090> why

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
going all kinds of crazy directions why

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.250 
going all kinds of crazy directions why
should<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> make<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.570> generally<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> same

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
should I make them generally the same

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
should I make them generally the same
about<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:10.830> length<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.520> further

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
about the same length as I get further

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
about the same length as I get further
for<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> tip<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.330> make<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.570> shorter<00:01:12.810> when

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
for the tip I make them shorter when

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.600 
for the tip I make them shorter when
they<00:01:13.680> first<00:01:13.830> started<00:01:14.100> writing<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> middle<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they first started writing a middle I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
they first started writing a middle I
make<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> pretty<00:01:14.880> long<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.500> see<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.770> said

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
make a pretty long I see them as I said

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.999 
make a pretty long I see them as I said
to<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.250> tip<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.729> shorter

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
to get the very tip and I can be shorter

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.870 
to get the very tip and I can be shorter
so<00:01:20.009> there's<00:01:20.189> one

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.280 

if<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.000> want<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:26.930> get<00:01:27.020> another<00:01:27.170> piece

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
if you want to you can get another piece

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.230 
if you want to you can get another piece
of<00:01:27.350> paper<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.770> lay<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.159> over<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.939> base<00:01:29.119> of

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
of paper and lay it over the base of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.670 
of paper and lay it over the base of
that<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.630> hand<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.259> smearing<00:01:30.530> all<00:01:30.619> the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
that this hand is it smearing all the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:02:02.580 
that this hand is it smearing all the
place

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590
