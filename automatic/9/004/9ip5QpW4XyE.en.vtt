okay<00:00:01.620> Jason<00:00:02.070> since<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:02.820> can<00:00:03.060> can't<00:00:03.540> come<00:00:03.689> out<00:00:03.780> to

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay Jason since I can can't come out to

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay Jason since I can can't come out to
Virginia<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.650> show<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.339> how<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:06.200> do<00:00:07.200> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
Virginia and show you how to do the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.879 
Virginia and show you how to do the
engine<00:00:07.740> myself<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.990> figured<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.230> video<00:00:10.559> would<00:00:10.769> be

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
engine myself I figured a video would be

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.390 
engine myself I figured a video would be
the<00:00:11.040> next<00:00:11.280> best<00:00:11.340> thing<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:13.130> obviously<00:00:14.130> my

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
the next best thing so obviously my

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.070 
the next best thing so obviously my
engines<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> little<00:00:15.120> bit<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:15.660> because<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
engines a little bit different because I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.650 
engines a little bit different because I
have<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.470> SVD<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.400> distributor<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> while<00:00:18.449> you

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
have the SVD a distributor and while you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.679 
have the SVD a distributor and while you
have<00:00:18.840> DVD<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> i<00:00:19.830> figured<00:00:20.820> i<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.270> go<00:00:21.449> through

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
have DVD a i figured i would go through

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.929 
have DVD a i figured i would go through
a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:22.230> bit<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.740> step-by-step<00:00:23.279> procedure

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
a little bit of a step-by-step procedure

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.210 
a little bit of a step-by-step procedure
to<00:00:24.269> show<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to show you what it is you can do to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.390 
to show you what it is you can do to
tune<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.400> engine<00:00:27.199> first<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.800> you're

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
tune your engine first of all as you're

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.620 
tune your engine first of all as you're
looking<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> there's<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.420> much

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
looking at it there's not really much

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.860 
looking at it there's not really much

distributor<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.719> try<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.780> fire<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.079> your

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
distributor and try and fire up your

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.459 
distributor and try and fire up your
engine<00:00:46.820> now<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.480> your<00:00:48.629> engine<00:00:48.780> isn't<00:00:49.110> firing

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
engine now if your engine isn't firing

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990 
described the first thing that I would
do<00:00:54.360> after<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.870> spark<00:00:55.170> plugs<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.879> check<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
do after your spark plugs is check the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.720 
do after your spark plugs is check the
points<00:00:57.300> gap<00:00:57.480> go<00:00:58.350> remove<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> distributor<00:00:59.520> cap

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

now<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.890> get<00:02:20.129> up<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> batteries<00:02:20.849> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
now I have to get up to a batteries you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.360 
now I have to get up to a batteries you
also<00:02:21.330> hook<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.599> up<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.930> positive<00:02:22.890> portion

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
also hook it up to the positive portion

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
also hook it up to the positive portion
of<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> coil<00:02:23.849> usually<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> wire<00:02:24.660> that
