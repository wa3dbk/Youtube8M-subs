many many times in Pokemon showdown you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
many many times in Pokemon showdown you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
absolutely for sure because head charge

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
absolutely for sure because head charge
and<00:02:07.170> wild<00:02:07.469> charge<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.950> both<00:02:08.129> moves<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.700> will

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and wild charge are both moves that will

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.729 
and wild charge are both moves that will
hurt<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> user<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.509> recoil<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.530> again

hurt the user with recoil but again

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.940 
hurt the user with recoil but again
that's<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.009> good<00:02:11.220> thing

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
attack even more while charges electric

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.479

which<00:02:19.540> also<00:02:19.750> has<00:02:19.959> recoil<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:21.250> will<00:02:21.340> make

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
which also has recoil but will make

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.160
