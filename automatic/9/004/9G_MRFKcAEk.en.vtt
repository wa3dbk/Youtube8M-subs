00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
to beam over shadowed by one else but in

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.050 
to beam over shadowed by one else but in
the<00:00:16.830> rest<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> stage<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.699> did<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.910> make

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the rest the stage but what did you make

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.510 
the rest the stage but what did you make
of<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.180> move<00:00:18.529> yeah<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.920> wasn't<00:00:20.220> really<00:00:20.340> an

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
of that move yeah it wasn't really an

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
of that move yeah it wasn't really an
attack<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.630> know<00:00:21.720> he<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.960> just

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
attack I think you know he was just

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529 
attack I think you know he was just
getting<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.529> front<00:00:23.060> because<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.300> knew<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
getting in the front because we knew the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.210 
getting in the front because we knew the
road<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:25.140> narrow<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.099> were<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
road was really narrow and there were a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.099 
road was really narrow and there were a
lot<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.369> spectators<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.840> wanted<00:00:28.050> to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
lot of spectators on it so we wanted to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
lot of spectators on it so we wanted to
be<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> front<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:29.310> didn't<00:00:29.460> want<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.789> get

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
be in the front we didn't want to be get

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
be in the front we didn't want to be get
tangled<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:30.960> crash<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.769> know

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
tangled up with some crash you know

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.490 
tangled up with some crash you know
because<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> road<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:32.820> small<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.660> there

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
because the road was small and and there

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.750 
because the road was small and and there
were<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> spectators<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
were a lot of spectators because that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
were a lot of spectators because that
was<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.210> small<00:00:36.510> rodent<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
was really a small rodent we do it so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
was really a small rodent we do it so
the<00:00:38.250> plan<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.850> Cadel<00:00:39.149> near<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the plan was to have Cadel near the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.630 
the plan was to have Cadel near the
front<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.719> wasn't<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:39.989> attack<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:41.460> said

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
front it wasn't an attack you said

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
front it wasn't an attack you said
yesterday<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.239> were<00:00:42.360> maybe<00:00:42.540> two

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
yesterday that there were maybe two

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
yesterday that there were maybe two
stages<00:00:43.079> where<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.620> weren't<00:00:43.950> opportunities

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
stages where there weren't opportunities

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389 
stages where there weren't opportunities
to<00:00:45.270> gain<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.840> time<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.230> sky<00:00:46.829> was<00:00:47.100> today

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to gain back time on sky was today

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
to gain back time on sky was today
perhaps<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.539> case<00:00:48.690> i<00:00:48.719> missed

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
perhaps in that case i missed

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.040 
perhaps in that case i missed
opportunity<00:00:49.700> no<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:50.940> mean<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> missed

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
opportunity no not i mean not a missed

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
opportunity no not i mean not a missed
opportunity<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.399> never

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
opportunity because there was never

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.020 
opportunity because there was never
presented<00:00:54.210> itself<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:55.020> an<00:00:55.110> opportunity

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
presented itself to be an opportunity

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.430 
presented itself to be an opportunity
because<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.300> park<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> sky

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
because the park or the way that sky

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
because the park or the way that sky
riding<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> front<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> park<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
riding on the front just the park or you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.990 
riding on the front just the park or you
know<00:01:00.510> too<00:01:00.570> far<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> last<00:01:01.640> climb<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
know too far from the last climb to the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.080 
know too far from the last climb to the
finish<00:01:03.120> line<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.580> wasn't

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
finish line and you know it just wasn't

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.770 
finish line and you know it just wasn't
enough<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> distance<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.680> too<00:01:07.830> large<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:09.240> say

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
enough the distance was too large to say

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
enough the distance was too large to say
you<00:01:09.840> had<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> 30-second<00:01:10.680> advantage<00:01:10.799> over<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you had a 30-second advantage over the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
you had a 30-second advantage over the
top<00:01:11.729> you'd<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.689> caught<00:01:12.930> before<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.439> bottom

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
top you'd get caught before the bottom

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
top you'd get caught before the bottom
so<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> useless<00:01:15.180> effort<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so it would be a useless effort and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.270 
so it would be a useless effort and
let's<00:01:16.500> talk<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.920> happened<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
let's talk about what happened at the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.429 
let's talk about what happened at the
top<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> climb<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.939> punchy<00:01:18.689> Adele<00:01:18.990> we

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
top of the climb a punchy Adele we

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.530 
top of the climb a punchy Adele we
saw<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.830> teammate<00:01:20.250> wait<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.270> wasn't<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
saw one teammate wait but there wasn't a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
saw one teammate wait but there wasn't a
quick<00:01:21.689> wheel<00:01:21.869> change<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
quick wheel change that's because he is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730 
quick wheel change that's because he is
both<00:01:23.520> his<00:01:23.700> wheels<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:24.119> flat<00:01:24.360> too<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:25.380> yes

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
both his wheels were flat too really yes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
both his wheels were flat too really yes
he<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.580> trying<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> wheel<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.450> well<00:01:27.659> we

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
he was trying to get a wheel as well we

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.030 
he was trying to get a wheel as well we
had<00:01:28.490> five<00:01:29.490> flats<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> climb

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
had five flats on the way up to climb

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.960 
had five flats on the way up to climb
that<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.189> didn't<00:01:32.400> even<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.640> about<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that we didn't even know about in the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.510 
that we didn't even know about in the
car<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.720> Cummings<00:01:34.170> came<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.979> Cadel<00:01:35.310> he
