00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello everyone good here space killer 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.660
 welcome to a new video today 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.400
 I bring something other than what it is 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.730
 lately, I'm studying a game on my channel 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.530
 distinct nba 2k 13 and well I'll introduce you to 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.560
 my team the first thing the game is 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.440
 seemed the ultimate team of fifa my 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.789
 team with more kobe durant howard and 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.870
 lebron james lebron doing 4 but 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 of 4 open 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.540
 and good more than it is a good savage 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 also this kid is a savage 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.140
 this wine goes that there is with 92 of shot of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.130
 three 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.489
 and good comes to the green morrow 9 karl 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.850
 marx bogans and harrison barnes in the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 bench and you'll say good why 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 you start to comment in this game 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.530
 it's because here we are playing at 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 river if we win this game 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.480
 we get promoted to the next 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.200
 division and we have larry bird if what 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.030
 we lose we have nothing we are not 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 we have to see we play against a team 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 with so can rolling stones worth and a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 bestiality and good and we see the jump that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 I earn it and nothing else to start in a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 play that goes up steve nash the star 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.680
 for me from the team 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.990
 there goes kobe bryant the pass over 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 to play that crushes the hoop there is the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.580
 Momma just the first play but the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.009
 you will see it will answer and we see in are of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.240
 backs ball to work if you take the 2 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.600
 plus 1 and aa2 jaguar even to put the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.270
 Free shot moves the screen because 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 when you play at home giving him 272 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 can make the screen move and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.830
 there we will see there hard will not continue this 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.959
 sorry they are going to be canceled overnight 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.940
 acting 21 century start as I would say 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.350
 andres montes 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.930
 and but hey in the end he gets the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.970
 basket that feries them we see the bounce 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.920
 of the robertson ball for korver korver 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.570
 for wars and for another two more 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.880
 one of wars and establish that the lack 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.250
 sting and novak also turned the shot 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.410
 free there again bank andro turning 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.390
 howard plug and again he makes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.620
 night you are going to be afraid of the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.440
 darkness give kan after this 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910
 party and good I can not finish 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.990
 counterattack because it avoids lack in 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.420
 attack there goes the ball of steve nash more 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.400
 the wta for kobe bryant above kobe 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.940
 bryant what posterity 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.500
 tim duncan and well then let's go we do 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.300
 in the second room as you came 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.920
 could see even the previous game in 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.150
 the second room there for adam khan of 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.930
 new from behind that will happen this time 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.900
 so if another extra plug of kobe ​​bryant 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.100
 three players have made plugs and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.660
 there again james jumping and crushing 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.900
 when we are in the second part of the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.900
 nash steal is given to Lebron who 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.360
 it's another matte to put the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.180
 marker to one and well here I will do 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.170
 a few small adjustments what I do is 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.820
 press the whole team because I 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.410
 was in the last room and there was 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.070
 win this game I remember you for 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.380
 get alan reppert and I put him 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.780
 he also leaves the ball at maximum 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.770
 white guard stars and so on 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.530
 etc 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.510
 lebron pull play long and enter 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.989
 attention to get to 2 in the absence of 4 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.989
 minutes 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.489
 there the rebound goes what you lose care 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.459
 robertson be careful that we are not going to 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.340
 up we do not go up salted anymore 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.100
 canary and the ink stopper want 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.940
 durán pardon for lebron who does the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.320
 hook and the mind for inside 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.320
 to put one up 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.329
 and there we see oscar robertson again 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.609
 oscar verses to the vanguard worth ya 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.069
 up and crush in front of lebron 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.959
 poster hoisting there lebron james and there 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.790
 it takes off from beating to care and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.450
 recovery that is borne by kevin 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.250
 durant 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.280
 anibal ebro above lebron elusive for 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.590
 commit lack in attack inside there 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.700
 korver stops in the triple that is not going to 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.189
 ball for howard or orphan above 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.940
 looking for doubt lebron james and does 2 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.770
 more 1 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.710
 and well here I had the game almost 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.750
 fact arrived and howard lack of shot and 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.060
 you will say because you have put this 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.700
 Well, now you're going to see what he's going to do 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.890
 howard the first one is going to put those who 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.420
 you understand and you see nba you will know why 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.550
 I put this this has a lot of meaning 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.740
 there we see the second free throw that 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.970
 he also puts it in howard and here is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.930
 when I knew I had to win this 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.760
 match 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.700
 it does not matter what cord me pieces is triple 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.190
 being totally alone but there goes to 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.900
 take lebron four three two in the 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.360
 second in the possession clock there goes 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.570
 up to lebron inside to put 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.490
 difference plus 5 and there triple that two 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.200
