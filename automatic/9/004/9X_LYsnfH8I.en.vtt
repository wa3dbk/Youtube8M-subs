00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
thousand other athletes but I think

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.350

we're able to catch a little bit of the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
we're able to catch a little bit of the
attention<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.990> far<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.409> hopefully<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.770> can
