00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.790
 Hey guys do it yourself 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.590
 I'm driving the traffic here. 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.240
 I bottled up to make a 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.789
 video of one thing I already did 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.429
 had to have made some time to switch to 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.359
 you a seat belt tip 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.800
 're seeing here the seat belt he 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.339
 have here 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.329
 is this little button that is not to leave the 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.460
 belt buckle to be cool nÃ© 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.629
 being that looks like it is buckle of the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.379
 belt for those who walk with open windows 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:48.620
 This is here on the bench and here 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:52.190
 ends up spoiling it by ruining it 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.719
 seam of seat belt 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.809
 by the friction of the buckle grazing on the belt 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.390
 until the person enters and leaves the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.519
 car sit on bench 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.770
 before buckling the belt here 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.950
 stay purple in the favela here over time 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.260
 you can ruin the upholstery at 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.540
 stitching you have here has a detail of the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.400
 stitching that is taking place is a tip that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 I wanted to give it if you grab the buckle. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.080
 pull over here she falls 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.110
 but if you take her and put her up 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.640
 pull a little learning here 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:34.600
 it stays fixed and does not fall without you having the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:38.150
 risk of getting spoiled here 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.730
 padding their bank or whether it 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.640
 of leather and fabric I decided to do this 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.510
 because the game and several service 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.290
 cars 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.300
 Ideally, this little button here that 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:58.190
 hold the buckle he's a little 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.280
 more up to keep the buckle without 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.380
 make contact with the bank 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.930
 so this is it people I'm here at 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.710
 transit in the center of the river 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.420
 January 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.390
 If you liked, do not forget to give 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.760
 joinha underneath but this cool tip of the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.480
 canal do it yourself for you 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.250
 a hug 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.250
 and until the next video
