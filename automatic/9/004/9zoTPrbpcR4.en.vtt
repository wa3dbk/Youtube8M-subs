00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
such as Excel you'll most likely want to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.139 
such as Excel you'll most likely want to
strip<00:02:01.170> carriage<00:02:01.619> return<00:02:01.979> live<00:02:02.189> feeds<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.790> if

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
were entering returns in some of these e

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.640 
were entering returns in some of these e
I'll<00:02:11.579> copy<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.570> note<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.110> last<00:02:13.410> one

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I'll copy it the note from the last one

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.009 
I'll copy it the note from the last one
and<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.430> example<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
and for example if I was in here and I

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.530 
and for example if I was in here and I
hit<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> return<00:02:16.620> key<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.890> few<00:02:17.160> times<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:18.390> can

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
