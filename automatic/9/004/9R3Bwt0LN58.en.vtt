00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
hey guys today I'm gonna be showing you

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.000 
hey guys today I'm gonna be showing you
this<00:00:06.420> compound<00:00:06.839> bow<00:00:07.049> which<00:00:07.230> I've<00:00:07.410> made<00:00:07.620> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
this compound bow which I've made and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.070 
this compound bow which I've made and
today's<00:00:08.309> gonna<00:00:08.490> be<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.820> shooting<00:00:09.179> video<00:00:09.330> as

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
today's gonna be the shooting video as

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.690 
today's gonna be the shooting video as
you<00:00:10.260> can<00:00:10.380> see<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.710> bow<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> compound<00:00:11.460> bow

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
you can see this bow is a compound bow

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
you can see this bow is a compound bow
and<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.000> means<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.480> got<00:00:12.660> cameras<00:00:13.110> on

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
and that means that it's got cameras on

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.169 
and that means that it's got cameras on
the<00:00:13.349> ends<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> limbs<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.190> when<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.969> pull

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the ends of the limbs and when you pull

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
the ends of the limbs and when you pull
back<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.570> limbs<00:00:15.780> then<00:00:16.080> when<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.070> fold

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
back the limbs then when you get to fold

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.130 
back the limbs then when you get to fold
it<00:00:17.430> away<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.850> reduces<00:00:18.420> withdrawal<00:00:18.840> weight<00:00:18.990> at

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it away it reduces withdrawal weight at

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.870 
it away it reduces withdrawal weight at
the<00:00:19.199> very<00:00:19.410> end<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.160> hold<00:00:20.340> full<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the very end so you can hold full to a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
the very end so you can hold full to a
weight<00:00:21.029> back<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.539> much<00:00:21.750> less<00:00:21.960> effort<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
weight back with much less effort the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.470 
weight back with much less effort the
reason<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.670> bow<00:00:23.880> looks<00:00:24.029> pretty<00:00:24.300> ugly

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
reason that this bow looks pretty ugly

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.750 
reason that this bow looks pretty ugly
with<00:00:24.960> all<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> big<00:00:25.410> bits<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> plywood<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
with all the big bits of plywood on is I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.849 
with all the big bits of plywood on is I
originally<00:00:27.510> made<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> Corvette<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.710> oak

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
originally made the Corvette out of oak

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.919 
originally made the Corvette out of oak
and<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:29.760> strong<00:00:30.060> apart<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.660> one

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and it was very strong apart from one

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
and it was very strong apart from one
point<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:31.710> snapped<00:00:32.040> when<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.279> pulled

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
point which then snapped when I pulled

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.510 
point which then snapped when I pulled
it<00:00:32.669> back<00:00:33.020> I've<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.230> fixed<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.890> reinforced

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it back I've now fixed it and reinforced

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.040 
it back I've now fixed it and reinforced
it<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.850> plywood<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.840> take<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it all with plywood if they can take a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
it all with plywood if they can take a
decent<00:00:37.290> amount<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> Norway

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
decent amount of Norway

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060 
decent amount of Norway
so<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.450> let's<00:00:39.660> test<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> draw<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.890> how

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so now let's test the draw and see how

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.910 
so now let's test the draw and see how
well<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> latter<00:00:41.520> works<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:43.020> peaks<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.469> 14

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
well the latter works it peaks at 14

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
well the latter works it peaks at 14
pounds<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> draw<00:00:44.579> weight<00:00:44.730> thereabouts<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
pounds of draw weight thereabouts and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.279 
pounds of draw weight thereabouts and
then<00:00:45.629> goes<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.140> 9<00:00:46.469> pounds<00:00:47.809> at<00:00:48.809> moment

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
then goes down to 9 pounds at moment

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.479 
then goes down to 9 pounds at moment
after<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:49.620> weights<00:00:49.800> lighter<00:00:50.100> than<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
after all weights lighter than what I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
after all weights lighter than what I
was<00:00:50.670> looking<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.629> test<00:00:51.840> out

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
was looking for but I'm gonna test out

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.360 
was looking for but I'm gonna test out
first

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.619 

I<00:00:57.760> suspected<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> booze<00:00:59.030> not<00:00:59.300> shipped<00:00:59.510> in

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
I suspected the booze not shipped in

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.420 
I suspected the booze not shipped in
very<00:00:59.840> powerfully<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:00.559> I'm<00:01:00.770> gonna<00:01:00.949> tighten<00:01:01.190> up

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
very powerfully so I'm gonna tighten up

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.990 
very powerfully so I'm gonna tighten up
all<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.910> strings<00:01:02.210> increase<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.840> doorway

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
all of the strings increase the doorway

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.640 
all of the strings increase the doorway
now<00:01:05.000> those<00:01:05.360> much<00:01:05.690> better<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:06.049> think<00:01:06.380> with<00:01:06.500> all

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
now those much better I think with all

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.730 
now those much better I think with all
weight<00:01:06.770> peaks<00:01:07.040> at<00:01:07.190> around<00:01:07.310> 25<00:01:07.940> pounds<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.740> in

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
weight peaks at around 25 pounds so in

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.170 
weight peaks at around 25 pounds so in
comparison<00:01:10.190> this<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.700> bull<00:01:10.850> shootin

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
comparison this is the bull shootin

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.170 
comparison this is the bull shootin
beforehand<00:01:12.399> this<00:01:13.399> is<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.700> bow<00:01:13.850> shooting

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
beforehand this is the bow shooting

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.389 
beforehand this is the bow shooting
afterwards<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.200> with<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.560> higher<00:01:15.740> draw<00:01:16.040> it

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
afterwards and with the higher draw it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.790 
afterwards and with the higher draw it
has<00:01:16.550> much<00:01:16.880> less<00:01:17.090> noise<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.780> also<00:01:18.200> find<00:01:18.590> some

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
has much less noise I also find some

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.080 
has much less noise I also find some
powder<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:19.399> much<00:01:19.640> more<00:01:19.850> accurate<00:01:24.970> now<00:01:25.970> it's

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
powder it's much more accurate now it's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.090 
powder it's much more accurate now it's
time<00:01:26.270> for<00:01:26.299> some<00:01:26.570> slow<00:01:26.750> motion<00:01:27.140> at<00:01:27.259> 240<00:01:27.979> frames

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
time for some slow motion at 240 frames

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.529 
time for some slow motion at 240 frames
a<00:01:28.340> second<00:01:28.729> with<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.880> GoPro<00:01:29.330> hero3<00:01:29.660> block<00:01:34.539> here

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
a second with a GoPro hero3 block here

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.029 
a second with a GoPro hero3 block here
I'm<00:01:35.690> shooting<00:01:36.020> out<00:01:36.140> my<00:01:36.259> bedroom<00:01:36.470> window<00:01:36.800> to

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
I'm shooting out my bedroom window to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.430 
I'm shooting out my bedroom window to
see<00:01:37.310> how<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.520> arrow<00:01:37.759> flies<00:01:38.119> at<00:01:38.330> longer<00:01:38.509> winds

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.690 

at<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:42.590> longer<00:01:42.800> range<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.340> see<00:01:43.550> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
at this longer range you can see that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.460 
at this longer range you can see that
the<00:01:43.789> bow<00:01:43.940> isn't<00:01:44.149> actually<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.780> powerful<00:01:45.170> and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the bow isn't actually that powerful and

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.990 
the bow isn't actually that powerful and
it<00:01:45.560> takes<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.890> while<00:01:45.920> for<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.460> arrow<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.819> reach

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
it takes a while for the arrow to reach

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
it takes a while for the arrow to reach
the<00:01:47.240> target

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.840 

this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> me<00:01:53.009> shooting<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.670> two

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this is me shooting at some two

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
this is me shooting at some two
millimeter<00:01:54.360> thick<00:01:54.539> plywood<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> arrow

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
millimeter thick plywood and the arrow

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.929 
millimeter thick plywood and the arrow
easily<00:01:56.159> goes<00:01:56.340> straight<00:01:56.640> through

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
easily goes straight through

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 
easily goes straight through
now<00:01:57.810> sometime<00:01:58.259> only<00:01:58.469> two<00:01:58.710> plywood<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.280> it's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
now sometime only two plywood and it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.300 
now sometime only two plywood and it's
not<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> problem<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.350> bow<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.770> even<00:02:05.100> shoot

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
not a problem the bow can even shoot

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.130 
not a problem the bow can even shoot
through<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.820> when<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> levels<00:02:06.600> put<00:02:06.840> together

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.930 

so<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.380> let<00:02:10.590> me<00:02:10.709> explain<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:11.280> bit<00:02:11.519> about<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so now let me explain a bit about the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.839 
so now let me explain a bit about the
weapon<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.500> core<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.980> made<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.340> oak<00:02:14.550> but

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
weapon the core is made of oak but

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.729 
weapon the core is made of oak but
snapped<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.720> had<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.019> reinforce<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.650> on

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
snapped so I had to reinforce it on

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.059 
snapped so I had to reinforce it on
either<00:02:16.890> side<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> plywood<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.830> limbs

about and it's got this special core
wrapped<00:02:32.580> around<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.269> doesn't<00:02:33.510> cut<00:02:33.660> into

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
wrapped around it so it doesn't cut into

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.080 
wrapped around it so it doesn't cut into
your<00:02:34.019> fingers<00:02:34.349> or<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.680> bone<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.430> overall<00:02:35.849> I'm

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
your fingers or the bone so overall I'm

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
your fingers or the bone so overall I'm
quite<00:02:36.120> happy<00:02:36.690> with<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> performance<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.769> this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
quite happy with the performance of this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.800 
quite happy with the performance of this
bill<00:02:38.190> apart<00:02:38.549> from<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> lord<00:02:39.269> rahl<00:02:39.480> way<00:02:39.630> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
bill apart from the lord rahl way I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.660 
bill apart from the lord rahl way I
would<00:02:40.319> tighten<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> strings<00:02:41.160> even<00:02:41.489> more

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
would tighten up the strings even more

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.160 
would tighten up the strings even more
but<00:02:41.849> I'm<00:02:41.940> afraid<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.299> I'd<00:02:42.540> snap<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.019> bow

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
but I'm afraid that I'd snap the bow

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.710 
but I'm afraid that I'd snap the bow
