that<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.179> don't<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.509> research<00:00:12.960> backing<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
that we don't have research backing up a

that we don't have research backing up a
lot<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> things<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.730> recommend<00:00:15.179> from

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
listener he was a fan of the show and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.599 
listener he was a fan of the show and
had<00:01:00.719> started<00:01:01.079> doing<00:01:01.289> organics<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.949> home<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
had started doing organics at home and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.450 
had started doing organics at home and
then<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.390> started<00:01:03.750> playing<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.979> organic

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
then he started playing with the organic

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
then he started playing with the organic
approach<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> research<00:01:06.810> center<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.470> he

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
approach at the research center and he

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.840 
approach at the research center and he
was<00:01:08.400> using<00:01:08.610> things<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.340> sticky<00:01:11.340> traps

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
was using things like the sticky traps

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
was using things like the sticky traps
and<00:01:12.299> he<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.540> using<00:01:12.689> some<00:01:13.080> soaps<00:01:13.439> he<00:01:13.740> started

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and he was using some soaps he started

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
and he was using some soaps he started
using<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> orange<00:01:14.850> oil<00:01:15.000> products<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> orange

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
using the orange oil products and orange

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
using the orange oil products and orange
all<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> molasses<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> compost<00:01:18.360> tea

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
all and molasses and compost tea

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
all and molasses and compost tea
drenching<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> fire<00:01:19.799> ant<00:01:20.009> mounds<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.490> he

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
drenching the fire ant mounds and he

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
drenching the fire ant mounds and he
eliminated<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> fire<00:01:21.570> ants<00:01:21.750> from<00:01:21.869> his

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
eliminated the fire ants from his

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.530 
eliminated the fire ants from his
property<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.670> really<00:01:23.670> started<00:01:24.060> getting<00:01:24.090> into

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
property and really started getting into

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450 
property and really started getting into
all<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.990> he's<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.400> his

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
all this but he's the one he and his

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
all this but he's the one he and his
staff<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> ones<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> discovered<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
staff are the ones that discovered that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.859 
staff are the ones that discovered that
cornmeal<00:01:30.259> broadcast<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:32.220> shut<00:01:32.549> down

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
cornmeal broadcast would shut down

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
cornmeal broadcast would shut down
rhizoctonia<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> peanut<00:01:34.890> crops<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.759> they

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
rhizoctonia in peanut crops and they

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.050 
rhizoctonia in peanut crops and they
were<00:01:36.360> doing<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> research<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
were doing the research on it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.999 
were doing the research on it
unfortunately<00:01:39.229> he<00:01:40.229> mysteriously<00:01:41.270> retired

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
unfortunately he mysteriously retired

corn<00:02:00.719> meal<00:02:00.869> ideas<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.680> he<00:02:02.250> said<00:02:02.969> he<00:02:03.360> didn't

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
corn meal ideas and he said he didn't

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
corn meal ideas and he said he didn't
know<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.770> any<00:02:05.009> interest<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
know that there was any interest in that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.749 
know that there was any interest in that
anymore<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.129> things<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.610> we

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
anymore so one of the things that we

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.790 
anymore so one of the things that we
deal<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.170> University

that they're standing in what Joe did
and<00:03:26.199> he<00:03:26.470> just<00:03:26.709> kind<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:27.009> did<00:03:27.189> it<00:03:27.220> as<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> maverick

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
and he just kind of did it as a maverick

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.490 
and he just kind of did it as a maverick
you<00:03:28.209> don't<00:03:28.389> think<00:03:28.540> he<00:03:28.659> even<00:03:28.720> got<00:03:28.959> approval<00:03:29.470> to

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
you don't think he even got approval to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.659 
you don't think he even got approval to
do<00:03:29.769> this<00:03:29.949> but<00:03:30.669> he<00:03:30.819> used<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.569> typical<00:03:32.169> chemical

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
do this but he used the typical chemical

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.610 
do this but he used the typical chemical
program<00:03:33.669> on<00:03:33.939> some<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.299> his<00:03:34.419> test<00:03:34.720> trials<00:03:35.379> which

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
program on some of his test trials which

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.439 
program on some of his test trials which
is<00:03:35.769> what<00:03:35.949> they're<00:03:36.159> in<00:03:36.340> now<00:03:36.519> notice<00:03:36.909> the<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
is what they're in now notice the the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.969 
is what they're in now notice the the
height<00:03:37.689> of<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.989> cotton<00:03:38.319> right<00:03:38.530> up<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.829> their

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
height of the cotton right up to their

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.089 
height of the cotton right up to their
knees<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.579> then<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> next<00:03:40.530> shows<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
knees and then the next shows the

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.080 
knees and then the next shows the
organic<00:03:42.879> plots<00:03:43.449> and<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.370> big<00:03:45.609> difference

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
organic plots and the big difference

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.800 
organic plots and the big difference
here<00:03:46.359> again<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.229> caused<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.699> the<00:03:49.030> economic

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
here again is caused the the economic

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.349 
here again is caused the the economic
benefit<00:03:50.409> because<00:03:50.650> not<00:03:51.370> only<00:03:51.400> are<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:52.060> plants

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
benefit because not only are the plants

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.289 
benefit because not only are the plants
and<00:03:52.629> much<00:03:53.470> bigger<00:03:53.859> can't<00:03:54.519> even<00:03:54.639> walk<00:03:54.759> down<00:03:54.819> the

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
and much bigger can't even walk down the

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.599 
and much bigger can't even walk down the
aisles<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:55.989> looking<00:03:56.290> down<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.829> road<00:03:56.859> by

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
aisles this is looking down the road by

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.670 
aisles this is looking down the road by
the<00:03:57.669> way<00:03:57.939> but<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:58.810> big<00:03:59.019> difference<00:03:59.049> is

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
the way but the big difference is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.050 
the way but the big difference is
there's<00:04:00.159> more<00:04:00.280> bowls<00:04:01.030> per<00:04:01.810> plant<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:03.699> money

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
there's more bowls per plant the money

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.409 
there's more bowls per plant the money
is<00:04:04.359> on<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.930> right<00:04:05.290> side<00:04:05.650> again<00:04:06.419> Cornell
