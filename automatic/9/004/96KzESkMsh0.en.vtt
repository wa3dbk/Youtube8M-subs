as a clear coat it's just a barrier

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.840 
as a clear coat it's just a barrier
around<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.560> shoe<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.160> ever<00:02:27.280> scuff<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850

shoe<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.420> know<00:02:28.510> maybe<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.840> get<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.990> wet<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
shoe you know maybe you get a wet the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.800 
shoe you know maybe you get a wet the
outer<00:02:30.280> layer<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.300> get<00:02:31.420> ruined<00:02:31.540> which

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
outer layer is going to get ruined which

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.450 
outer layer is going to get ruined which
is<00:02:31.990> just<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.320> Polish<00:02:32.650> once<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.980> take<00:02:33.160> all<00:02:33.310> that

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
is just a Polish once you take all that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.370 
is just a Polish once you take all that
polish<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.270> shoe<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.780> actually<00:02:34.960> still

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
polish off the shoe is actually still

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.990 
polish off the shoe is actually still
intact<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.280> last<00:02:36.550> step<00:02:36.820> will<00:02:36.970> be

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
intact so the last step will be

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.270 
intact so the last step will be
protection<00:02:37.690> which<00:02:38.080> will<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.380> adding<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.920> Polish

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
protection which will be adding a Polish
