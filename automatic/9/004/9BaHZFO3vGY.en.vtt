 characters in a frame of insane dialogue and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.030
 of course he was irony this time closed 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.130
 the club is still a model 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.920

 inventory and reginald winslow's background 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.110
 the role of dealers acts incomparable 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.420
 Glados which after the series portal 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.310
 moved to a new level of sarcasm and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 thin jokes and behind the bar 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.500

 got generals kunk n mechanic doc 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 gangster steve and all the same max rabbit and 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.130
 finally when the last guest 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.050
 sits down 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.750
 table pre with wild bang 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.450
 flying away in the hall window and the game itself begins 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.430
 since the original mechanic of course 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.030
 changed little but overgrown with many 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.130
 details 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.440
 the most important thing is that the developers have entered 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.150
 tutorial for strangers to poker people 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.400
 this is standard teaching aids 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.950
 which introduces players to basic 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.540
 poker principles and concepts as well 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.120
 demonstrate all possible 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.250
 card combinations are actually all about 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:53.960
 than I said in the previous video by 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:55.940
 the first part of poker is visible to gamers 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.490
 not bored besides the traditional 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.310
 Texas Hold'em Teltel added 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.960
 Omaha one of the varieties of poker there 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.520
 there are no significant differences 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.240
 adapt themselves to every opponent 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.160
 4 cards in hand instead of the traditional 2 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.290
 but still a small feature when 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.260
 Only two of these four are counted. 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.360
 skate to the original and 4 prizes 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.490
 each of which could naturally 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.830
 take away your opponent by clearing his pockets 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.110
 these things then appeared team fortress 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.810
 2 and could be used by certain 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.360
 classes now it is much more varnishes 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.400
 but also to get them is more difficult and that you 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.380
 thought you just give a promo like 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.160
 weld do with their latest games 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.380
 nifiga 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.170
 First, the developers removed the shift 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.120
 difficulty putting all players equal 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.580
 conditions secondly our intelligence 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.350
 rivals increased markedly if earlier 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.630
 each of the four at the table 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.360
 played only in a certain style it 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.670
 were aggressive bluff cautious or 1 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.160
 randomly out of 3 now 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.620
 enemy behavior is constantly changing 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.480
 you may have gone through the interrogation school howled and 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.790
 But Ira proud that one by one 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.250
 eye movement are able to determine 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.320
 lie to you or not however here it is not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.990
 will help though of course the animation of the characters 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.690
 sometimes more than eloquently catch in 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.240
 the ballet is not always possible and right here on 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.160
 help comes another innovation 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.530
 Now we are able to order 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.570
 rival binge who will tell them 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.100
 language and at certain moments will become 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.350
 clear who and how to play 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.300
 strong drinks are purchased on 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.400
 special tokens that are given for 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.260
 victory in the tournament with their help we do not 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.020
 just take out the maxi from the rack 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.330
 bar forcing someone to carry alcohol but 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.730
 and change the whole style of the gaming room 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.010
 It looks like this is a special menu 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.990
 the ability to change the look has become chips and 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.050
 cards except the traditional option 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.940
 design which is already default 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.280
 there are five more each of which 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.650
 matches the opponent at the table then 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.710
 there we can create a style of 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.050
 brothers ventura borderlands and vildad 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.450
 sam and max series and latest style 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.550
 will be the entourage of the port as soon as we 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.480
 collect the whole set is changing not only these 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.970
 small items 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.110
 but also the entourage of the entire hall as well as the sound 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.450
 escort 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.980
 now with victory over somebody 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.840
 new setting we get both 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.790
 a unique reward that can 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.920
 rather unusual to look new about 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.710
 learn it yourself and let us become 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.540
 witness the exciting scenes of the sequel 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.250
 visibly stepped towards the atmosphere because 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.230
 poker is not just a game for money 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.020
 unless of course you are not a sports fan 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.880
 its parts this communication is just like 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.770
 someone discussing their household with friends 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.200
 problems let's say poker heroes night 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.670
 Claptrap talking to each other 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.250
 suggests bro poof become his 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.680
 bodyguard and he laughs at the dog 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.780
 in a suit that plays poker in the meantime 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.270
 eat questioning sam or his marriage 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.520
 a little robot flirts a warehouse with 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.500
 and all this happens under a wonderful sound 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.720
 jazz music under which even 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.420
 stylized main themes of borderlands 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.430
 and spree kinder when I heard my topic 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.880
 of the bards, then involuntarily began to click 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.220
 finger 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.380
 tact melody suddenly somewhere between 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.420
 discussing dubstep and jay works 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.000
 jay abramsa you can catch yourself on 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.130
 that I will hear the conversation raised 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 bid up and going 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.490
 go for broke 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.560
 well that means ltl did the job 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.390
 poker night takes you captive so that a 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.430
 during the game you stopped thinking 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.740
 authors can only be blamed for two 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.750
 things they never added multiplayer 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.230
 which I had hoped for some reason 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.360
 cheated oks 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.250
 against the background of those who never stop and chic 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.680

 when it carries on figs with those game stands 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.630

 god some blockbuster which is 10 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.220
 time is more expensive but it is the final 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.880
 stroke of the eternal question to take or not 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.400
