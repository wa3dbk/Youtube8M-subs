well<00:00:02.260> the<00:00:02.770> first<00:00:02.800> when<00:00:03.550> I<00:00:03.580> first<00:00:03.969> got<00:00:04.210> back

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:04.479 
well the first when I first got back

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:06.269 
well the first when I first got back
into<00:00:04.779> the<00:00:04.930> game<00:00:05.229> and<00:00:05.529> I<00:00:05.620> started<00:00:06.009> judging

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
into the game and I started judging

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.209 
into the game and I started judging
battles<00:00:06.970> I<00:00:07.180> saw<00:00:08.170> something<00:00:08.830> that<00:00:08.860> was<00:00:09.190> just

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
battles I saw something that was just

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.629 
battles I saw something that was just
incredibly<00:00:10.150> ridiculous<00:00:10.420> to<00:00:11.080> me<00:00:11.230> and<00:00:11.440> that<00:00:12.400> was

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
incredibly ridiculous to me and that was

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.350 
incredibly ridiculous to me and that was
they<00:00:13.509> would<00:00:13.660> have<00:00:13.840> battles<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:14.620> have<00:00:14.920> this

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
they would have battles and have this

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960 
they would have battles and have this
humongous<00:00:16.360> cypher<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.800> promoters<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.730> holes

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
humongous cypher the promoters the holes

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.900 
humongous cypher the promoters the holes
everybody<00:00:19.689> will<00:00:19.930> open<00:00:20.410> up<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.739> floor<00:00:21.070> right

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
everybody will open up the floor right

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.569 
everybody will open up the floor right
and<00:00:22.270> you<00:00:22.810> would<00:00:22.960> have<00:00:23.140> like<00:00:23.380> 20<00:00:23.919> by<00:00:24.099> 20<00:00:24.160> feet

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
and you would have like 20 by 20 feet

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.170 
and you would have like 20 by 20 feet
space<00:00:25.419> and<00:00:26.009> people<00:00:27.009> would<00:00:27.189> still<00:00:27.640> crashing

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
space and people would still crashing

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.999 
space and people would still crashing
into<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.540> crowd<00:00:28.809> and<00:00:29.140> that<00:00:29.559> didn't<00:00:29.919> make

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
into the crowd and that didn't make

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.370 
into the crowd and that didn't make
sense<00:00:30.070> because<00:00:31.000> in<00:00:31.300> my<00:00:31.450> days<00:00:31.719> you<00:00:32.110> dance

either at parties and at clubs and if

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.950 
either at parties and at clubs and if
you<00:00:35.800> dance<00:00:36.100> in<00:00:36.370> those<00:00:36.490> situations<00:00:37.390> you<00:00:37.630> really

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
you dance in those situations you really

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.710 
you dance in those situations you really
didn't<00:00:38.320> have<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.530> lot<00:00:38.770> of<00:00:38.800> space<00:00:39.240> you<00:00:40.240> know<00:00:40.420> and

and that was how I started doing the
Octagon<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.830> what<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.790> Octagon<00:01:13.330> really<00:01:13.870> does

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
Octagon and what the Octagon really does

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.120 
Octagon and what the Octagon really does
it<00:01:14.440> promotes<00:01:15.150> control<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:17.130> freestyle

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
it promotes control and freestyle

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.340 
it promotes control and freestyle
ability<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.760> if<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.690> look<00:01:19.840> at<00:01:19.960> everybody

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
ability and if you look at everybody

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.260 
ability and if you look at everybody
who's<00:01:20.530> ever<00:01:20.680> trained<00:01:21.100> by<00:01:21.280> me<00:01:21.460> they<00:01:21.610> all<00:01:21.790> share

is because that's what the Octagon

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.740 
is because that's what the Octagon
promotes<00:01:29.950> its<00:01:30.250> other<00:01:30.729> than<00:01:31.090> actually
