I've<00:00:10.380> got<00:00:12.259> to<00:00:13.259> make<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.530> video<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.009> basically

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
I've got to make this video I basically

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
I've got to make this video I basically
recorded<00:00:15.630> every<00:00:16.049> chest<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.039> after

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
recorded every chest that I got after

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.170 
recorded every chest that I got after
the<00:00:17.699> QbD<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:19.279> compile<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.460> together<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the QbD and compile it together to a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720 
the QbD and compile it together to a
very<00:00:21.510> long<00:00:21.689> video<00:00:22.220> if<00:00:23.220> you've<00:00:23.369> seen<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:23.699> other

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
very long video if you've seen my other

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.210 
very long video if you've seen my other
video<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.600> QT<00:00:24.990> review<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.439> stuff<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
video about the QT review and stuff you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
video about the QT review and stuff you
should<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.930> 17<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.920> think

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
should see that the first 17 I think

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.120 
should see that the first 17 I think
yeah<00:00:29.519> 17<00:00:30.000> lutz<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.539> being<00:00:31.529> repeated<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.980> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
yeah 17 lutz are being repeated in this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
yeah 17 lutz are being repeated in this
video<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.059> think<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.989> right<00:00:34.290> just

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
video but I think that's all right just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
video but I think that's all right just
because<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.579> showing<00:00:35.850> over<00:00:36.090> 100<00:00:36.480> kills<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because it's showing over 100 kills to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.060 
because it's showing over 100 kills to
see<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> drop<00:00:37.590> rate<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.040> far<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
see what the drop rate of so far and I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.060 
see what the drop rate of so far and I
hope<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.489> put<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.450> speed<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.800> clips

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
hope I put the speed of the clips

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.479 
hope I put the speed of the clips
quackety<00:00:44.820> um<00:00:45.500> some<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> groups<00:00:46.920> might<00:00:47.280> be

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
quackety um some of the groups might be

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
quackety um some of the groups might be
too<00:00:47.670> fast<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.710> just

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
too fast but I think it will be just

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
too fast but I think it will be just
fine<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.789> big<00:00:51.390> drops<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
fine because all big drops like the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.130 
fine because all big drops like the
crossbow<00:00:52.949> parts<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.969> visage<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.930> got

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
crossbow parts and a visage that I got

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.240 
crossbow parts and a visage that I got
is<00:00:56.719> slow<00:00:57.719> down<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> everyone<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.039> view

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is slow down so that everyone can view

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.270 
is slow down so that everyone can view
it<00:00:59.750> to<00:01:00.750> get<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.350> kills<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.010> use

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it to get all of these kills I use

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.000 
it to get all of these kills I use
several<00:01:02.670> different<00:01:02.789> methods<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.860> some<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
several different methods and some of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.310 
several different methods and some of
them<00:01:05.189> were<00:01:05.369> annoying<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.080> were

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
good fast and some of them were just

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.730 
good fast and some of them were just
annoying<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:10.950> i<00:01:11.159> had<00:01:11.340> lag<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> let's

would say upgraded to using it still
tied<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.490> faster<00:01:32.880> coast

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
tied for faster coast

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.640 
tied for faster coast
the<00:01:34.990> problem<00:01:35.409> with<00:01:36.210> QT<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.750> if<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.619> have

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
the problem with QT is that if you have

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.219 
the problem with QT is that if you have
lag<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.790> get<00:01:39.970> those<00:01:40.119> four<00:01:40.390> Souls<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:41.080> can

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
lag and you get those four Souls you can

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.530 
lag and you get those four Souls you can
pretty<00:01:41.409> much<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.799> say<00:01:42.070> bye-bye<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.670> anyhow

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
pretty much just say bye-bye to anyhow

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.810 
pretty much just say bye-bye to anyhow
you<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.869> left<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.229> your<00:01:44.259> health<00:01:44.590> bar<00:01:44.799> even<00:01:45.640> if

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
you have left in your health bar even if

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.620 
you have left in your health bar even if
you<00:01:46.000> have<00:01:47.670> next<00:01:48.670> armors<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.180> can<00:01:49.299> still<00:01:49.509> get

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
you have next armors you can still get

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.260 
you have next armors you can still get
killed<00:01:49.899> if<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.290> gets<00:01:50.470> 4<00:01:50.710> lakh<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.340> lately<00:01:52.000> I've

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
killed if it gets 4 lakh and lately I've

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.990 
killed if it gets 4 lakh and lately I've
had<00:01:52.450> some<00:01:52.630> problems<00:01:53.080> with<00:01:53.140> getting<00:01:53.799> over<00:01:54.460> 1k

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
had some problems with getting over 1k

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.859 
had some problems with getting over 1k
ping<00:01:55.330> spikes<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.399> have<00:01:57.430> over<00:01:58.149> 1000

ping spikes and when you have over 1000

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.039 
ping spikes and when you have over 1000
hang<00:01:59.110> its<00:02:00.210> some<00:02:01.210> of<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> actions<00:02:01.780> just

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
hang its some of the actions just

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.109 
hang its some of the actions just
impossible<00:02:02.380> like<00:02:02.770> dodging<00:02:03.100> fire<00:02:03.520> waves<00:02:03.820> and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.740 
doing just general stuff they we think
is<00:02:06.399> really<00:02:06.610> easy<00:02:06.729> on<00:02:07.060> us<00:02:07.090> it's<00:02:07.479> just

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
is really easy on us it's just

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.390 
is really easy on us it's just
impossible<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:10.350> I've<00:02:11.350> had<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> lot<00:02:12.069> of<00:02:12.130> kills

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
impossible so I've had a lot of kills

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.949 
impossible so I've had a lot of kills
where<00:02:12.580> I've<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.880> raged<00:02:13.180> because<00:02:13.600> those

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
where I've just raged because those

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.170 
where I've just raged because those
souls<00:02:14.440> through<00:02:14.739> either<00:02:14.860> fires<00:02:15.310> or<00:02:15.670> time<00:02:15.880> stops

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
souls through either fires or time stops

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.670 
souls through either fires or time stops
or<00:02:16.360> anything<00:02:16.630> I've<00:02:16.780> got<00:02:16.959> me<00:02:17.140> because<00:02:17.410> I've

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
or anything I've got me because I've

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.520 
or anything I've got me because I've
lagged<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.310> could<00:02:18.610> dodge<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:20.230> other<00:02:20.410> thing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
lagged and could dodge the other thing

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.920 
lagged and could dodge the other thing
that's<00:02:20.709> annoying<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.220> when<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.060> souls<00:02:22.720> are

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that's annoying is when the souls are

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.770 
that's annoying is when the souls are
sidestepping<00:02:23.730> which<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:25.030> means<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.450> you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
sidestepping which just means that you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.440 
sidestepping which just means that you
just<00:02:26.019> dodged<00:02:26.260> them<00:02:26.560> correctly<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.489> then<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
just dodged them correctly but then the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.009 
just dodged them correctly but then the
monster<00:02:29.549> all<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.819> glitch<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.569> it's<00:02:31.840> not

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
monster all of this glitch but it's not

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.720 
monster all of this glitch but it's not
the<00:02:32.049> way<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.290> should<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.489> aggressive

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the way it should be it not aggressive

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.789 
the way it should be it not aggressive
towards<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.569> just<00:02:34.840> wanders<00:02:35.290> off<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
towards you and just wanders off and

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.920 
towards you and just wanders off and
just<00:02:36.580> makes<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:37.239> hit<00:02:37.390> by<00:02:37.510> all<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> far

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
just makes you get hit by all the far

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.830 
just makes you get hit by all the far
shadows<00:02:38.319> either<00:02:38.560> way<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:39.630> should<00:02:40.630> get<00:02:40.780> it

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
shadows either way but should get it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.900 
shadows either way but should get it
fixed<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.230> my<00:02:41.320> opinion<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.820> I've<00:02:43.750> done<00:02:44.170> if<00:02:44.320> a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
fixed in my opinion so I've done if a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.259 
fixed in my opinion so I've done if a
mixed<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.060> range<00:02:46.359> kills<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.049> melee<00:02:47.410> kills<00:02:48.269> the

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
mixed of range kills and melee kills the

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.530 
mixed of range kills and melee kills the
melee<00:02:49.630> kills<00:02:50.019> are<00:02:50.260> faster<00:02:50.980> but<00:02:51.370> comes<00:02:52.299> with<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
melee kills are faster but comes with a

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.590 
melee kills are faster but comes with a
better<00:02:52.780> risk<00:02:53.049> but<00:02:53.410> then<00:02:53.590> again<00:02:54.299> more<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.450> more

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
better risk but then again more the more

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.990 
better risk but then again more the more
is<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.019> more<00:02:56.170> reward<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:59.280> after<00:03:00.280> did<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> lot<00:03:00.970> of

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
is the more reward so after did a lot of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000 
is the more reward so after did a lot of
me<00:03:01.209> like<00:03:01.390> hills<00:03:01.600> for<00:03:01.840> speed<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.350> range<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
me like hills for speed and range the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.319 
me like hills for speed and range the
business<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.850> my<00:03:04.090> lag<00:03:04.329> I<00:03:05.519> once<00:03:06.519> started<00:03:07.030> doing

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
business of my lag I once started doing

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.020 
business of my lag I once started doing
just<00:03:07.540> range<00:03:07.780> hills<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.200> pernix<00:03:08.910> assume<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
just range hills and pernix assume the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.240 
just range hills and pernix assume the
year<00:03:10.180> all<00:03:10.299> crossbow<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.769> say<00:03:11.980> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
year all crossbow and have to say that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.479 
year all crossbow and have to say that
it's<00:03:12.910> really<00:03:13.209> good<00:03:14.200> you're<00:03:15.100> getting<00:03:15.370> an

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
it's really good you're getting an

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.729 
it's really good you're getting an
average<00:03:15.850> i'd<00:03:16.090> say<00:03:16.390> six<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.140> eight<00:03:17.410> minute

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
average i'd say six to eight minute

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.770 
average i'd say six to eight minute
kills<00:03:17.950> an<00:03:18.130> average<00:03:18.430> using<00:03:19.030> still<00:03:19.299> hiding<00:03:19.569> and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
kills an average using still hiding and

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.500 
kills an average using still hiding and
read<00:03:19.989> nips<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:21.700> not<00:03:22.000> really<00:03:22.329> bad

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
read nips and that's not really bad

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.770 
read nips and that's not really bad
because<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.930> also<00:03:23.319> use<00:03:23.709> less<00:03:23.980> bruise<00:03:24.569> which

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
because you also use less bruise which

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.290 
because you also use less bruise which
just<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.950> great<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:28.490> my<00:03:28.640> opinion<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:31.300> then

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
just just great in my opinion and then

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.870 
just just great in my opinion and then
during<00:03:32.930> maybe<00:03:33.319> last<00:03:33.620> 10<00:03:34.010> or<00:03:34.040> 15<00:03:34.250> kills<00:03:34.700> I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
during maybe last 10 or 15 kills I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.160 
during maybe last 10 or 15 kills I
started<00:03:35.240> using<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.600> hybrid<00:03:35.990> I<00:03:37.120> i<00:03:38.120> sold<00:03:38.720> my<00:03:38.840> Torah

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
started using a hybrid I i sold my Torah

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.410 
started using a hybrid I i sold my Torah
so<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.130> only<00:03:40.640> had<00:03:40.910> my<00:03:41.150> pernix<00:03:41.600> left<00:03:41.810> and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
so that I only had my pernix left and

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.500 
so that I only had my pernix left and
you<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.800> pretty<00:03:45.800> effectively<00:03:46.340> melee<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.150> her

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
you can pretty effectively melee in her

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.880 
you can pretty effectively melee in her
neck<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:47.810> I'll<00:03:47.959> get<00:03:48.080> ahead<00:03:48.260> too<00:03:48.440> much<00:03:48.620> for<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
neck so I'll get ahead too much for the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.550 
neck so I'll get ahead too much for the
melee<00:03:49.069> attack<00:03:49.370> if<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.670> salsa<00:03:49.910> flicker<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:51.260> for

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
melee attack if you salsa flicker so for

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.470 
melee attack if you salsa flicker so for
the<00:03:51.620> first<00:03:51.770> three<00:03:52.130> phases<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.790> did<00:03:53.000> rapier

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
the first three phases I did rapier

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.720 
the first three phases I did rapier
using<00:03:53.870> terminal<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.500> assess<00:03:55.190> wicker<00:03:55.430> and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
using terminal and assess wicker and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.729 
using terminal and assess wicker and
then<00:03:56.450> on<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.690> last<00:03:56.900> phase<00:03:57.319> where<00:03:57.590> there's

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
then on the last phase where there's

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.340 
then on the last phase where there's
four<00:03:57.980> shadows<00:03:58.370> which<00:03:58.610> can<00:03:58.850> kou<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.540> switch<00:04:00.080> over

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
four shadows which can kou I switch over

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.930 
four shadows which can kou I switch over
to<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.769> year<00:04:00.950> old<00:04:01.130> crossbow<00:04:01.550> which<00:04:01.700> is

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
to the year old crossbow which is

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.759 
to the year old crossbow which is
actually<00:04:02.360> pretty<00:04:02.600> quite<00:04:03.080> effective<00:04:03.590> once

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
actually pretty quite effective once

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.910 
actually pretty quite effective once
you've<00:04:03.890> done<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.160> nine<00:04:04.310> hits<00:04:05.560> actually<00:04:06.560> it's

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
you've done the nine hits actually it's

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.830 
you've done the nine hits actually it's
really<00:04:07.070> well<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.550> when<00:04:08.209> she's<00:04:08.510> doing<00:04:08.750> the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
really well and when she's doing the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.509 
really well and when she's doing the
fire<00:04:09.019> wave<00:04:09.200> attack<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.620> can<00:04:09.769> just<00:04:09.950> tanks<00:04:10.340> will

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
fire wave attack you can just tanks will

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.800
