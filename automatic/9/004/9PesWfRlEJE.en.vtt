by having the performance aspect of the
focal<00:00:36.120> point<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.450> were<00:00:36.540> able<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
focal point we were able to make a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110 
focal point we were able to make a
stylish<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.920> forming<00:00:38.280> product<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> I'm

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
stylish the forming product that I'm

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990 
stylish the forming product that I'm
really<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.840> iconic<00:00:40.440> based<00:00:40.770> around<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
really is iconic based around just the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
really is iconic based around just the
simplicities<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.290> thinking<00:00:43.680> less<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
simplicities like just thinking less is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
simplicities like just thinking less is
more<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:45.000> construction<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.629> were<00:00:45.690> able<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
more this construction we were able to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
more this construction we were able to
have<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> midsole<00:00:47.399> in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
have actually a little bit of midsole in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
have actually a little bit of midsole in
the<00:00:47.820> front<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.600> mid<00:00:48.840> sole<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> heel

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the front then we have mid sole and heel

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
the front then we have mid sole and heel
to<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.070> well<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:50.700> comfortable

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to as well so it's a very comfortable

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.229 
to as well so it's a very comfortable
shoes<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.930> fact<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.230> has<00:00:52.410> free<00:00:53.120> notches<00:00:54.120> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
shoes the fact that has free notches in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
shoes the fact that has free notches in
it<00:00:54.390> free<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.110> based<00:00:55.410> around<00:00:55.590> siping<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
it free was based around siping which is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.270 
it free was based around siping which is
you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> act<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.260> cutting<00:00:58.590> rubber

you know the act of cutting rubber

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
you know the act of cutting rubber
notches<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.480> allows<00:01:00.899> us<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> really

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
notches which allows us to have a really

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
notches which allows us to have a really
flexible<00:01:01.859> shoe<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.789> saying<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.870> awesome

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
eating of it for like you know about

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
eating of it for like you know about
five<00:01:15.540> minutes<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.590> just

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
five minutes and then they can just

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.340 
five minutes and then they can just
assemble<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> line<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.509> less

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
assemble it right on the line it's less

really<00:01:23.430> cool<00:01:23.670> thing<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> uh<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.540> actually<00:01:24.869> put

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
really cool thing is uh we actually put

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.390 
really cool thing is uh we actually put
a<00:01:25.080> elastic<00:01:25.770> guested<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> tongue<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.290> that

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
a elastic guested on the tongue so that

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.740 
a elastic guested on the tongue so that
you<00:01:29.400> actually<00:01:29.520> could<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.240> laces<00:01:30.450> out

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you actually could take these laces out

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
you actually could take these laces out
and<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.040> wear<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.850> day

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
on the cool thing about that is forms

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.289 
on the cool thing about that is forms
are<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.159> forefoot<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.579> keeps<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.000> saw
