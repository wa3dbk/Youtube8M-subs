00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
that it's finally getting around there

will<00:00:23.640> start<00:00:23.910> from<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> very<00:00:24.180> beginning<00:00:24.480> you

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
will start from the very beginning you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
will start from the very beginning you
have<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> microphone<00:00:26.490> input<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> front<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
have a microphone input on the front and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.409 
have a microphone input on the front and
the<00:00:27.630> back<00:00:28.020> which<00:00:28.739> you<00:00:28.919> can<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.700> between<00:00:29.880> which

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
the back which you can go between which

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.120 
the back which you can go between which
is<00:00:30.450> great<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.290> you<00:00:31.410> need<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.680> plug<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is great when you need to plug in the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.500 
is great when you need to plug in the
front<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.550> haven't<00:00:32.790> found<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.210> iraq

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
front if you haven't found it in iraq

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.580 
front if you haven't found it in iraq
and<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> reach<00:00:34.350> behind

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and you don't have to reach behind

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
and you don't have to reach behind
something<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:35.880> good<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
something but it's also good that you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.050 
something but it's also good that you
can<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:37.050> between<00:00:37.350> two<00:00:37.649> mics<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> same

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
can a be between two mics on the same

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.170 
can a be between two mics on the same
signal<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.559> between<00:00:40.859> them<00:00:41.340> nice

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
signal and you can go between them nice

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.549 
signal and you can go between them nice
feature<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.879> DI<00:00:45.120> inputs<00:00:45.780> which

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
feature then we have the DI inputs which

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.970 
feature then we have the DI inputs which
are<00:00:46.910> not<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.210> typical<00:00:48.570> di<00:00:49.050> inputs<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:49.710> mic

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
are not your typical di inputs on a mic

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.349 
are not your typical di inputs on a mic
pre<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.179> their<00:00:51.329> own

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
pre they actually have their own

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.639 
pre they actually have their own
dedicated<00:00:52.070> transformer<00:00:53.149> before<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
dedicated transformer before the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.180 
dedicated transformer before the
discrete<00:00:56.600> solid-state<00:00:57.600> section<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.829> unit

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
discrete solid-state section of the unit

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.829 
discrete solid-state section of the unit
so<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.999> like<00:01:00.239> you're<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.629> through

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
so it's not like you're going through

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.389 
so it's not like you're going through
the<00:01:00.960> transformer<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.589> then<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> mic<00:01:02.129> pre

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the transformer and then the mic pre

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.979 
the transformer and then the mic pre
transformer<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.179> you<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> normal

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
transformer as you would with the normal

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.900 
transformer as you would with the normal
passive<00:01:04.379> di<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.640> coming

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
passive di but you're actually coming

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.570 
passive di but you're actually coming
out<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> DI<00:01:06.630> transformer<00:01:07.440> directly<00:01:08.220> into

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
out as the DI transformer directly into

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
out as the DI transformer directly into
the<00:01:08.700> active<00:01:09.090> circuitry<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.870> pre<00:01:11.270> has<00:01:12.270> two

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the active circuitry of the pre has two

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.010 
the active circuitry of the pre has two
inputs<00:01:13.040> one<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.390> buffered<00:01:15.390> input<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
inputs one is a buffered input with the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080 
inputs one is a buffered input with the
10<00:01:16.230> mega<00:01:16.500> ohm<00:01:16.650> input<00:01:16.890> impedance<00:01:17.190> before<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
10 mega ohm input impedance before the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.720 
10 mega ohm input impedance before the
DI<00:01:18.750> transformer<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.890> comes<00:01:20.190> directly<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
DI transformer and one comes directly to

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.290 
DI transformer and one comes directly to
the<00:01:20.970> primary<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.840> transformer<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
the primary of the transformer so this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.240 
the primary of the transformer so this
would<00:01:24.510> be<00:01:24.540> used<00:01:24.870> for<00:01:25.110> passive<00:01:25.590> pickups<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
would be used for passive pickups and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
would be used for passive pickups and
this<00:01:26.370> would<00:01:26.550> be<00:01:26.580> used<00:01:26.940> for<00:01:27.120> active<00:01:27.540> pickups

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this would be used for active pickups

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.110 
this would be used for active pickups
however<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> find<00:01:29.340> yourself<00:01:29.490> always

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
however if you find yourself always

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
using the input for active Pickett

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.160 
using the input for active Pickett
pickups<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.760> example<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.780> set<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
pickups for example you can set the

round little abs transformer that we
chose<00:01:46.700> after<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.450> lot<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.080> testing<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.680> what<00:01:49.310> the

commercially available transformers out
there<00:01:51.350> were<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:53.180> made<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.930> it's<00:01:54.050> very<00:01:54.170> easy

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
there were I made it so it's very easy

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.590 
there were I made it so it's very easy
though<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.890> use<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.270> different<00:01:56.270> input

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
though to use a different input

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.450 
though to use a different input
transformer<00:01:57.170> if<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.500> want<00:01:57.800> on<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.190> front<00:01:58.430> of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
very given to Barry White where you can

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.509 
very given to Barry White where you can
turn<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> mouse<00:04:07.750> into<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.200> moose<00:04:09.599> okay<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:12.370> we<00:04:12.489> I

other little lab products we have

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.479 
other little lab products we have
something<00:04:15.849> called<00:04:16.239> out<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.220> BP<00:04:18.220> which

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
something called out you I BP which

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.939 
something called out you I BP which
stands<00:04:18.880> for<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.239> between<00:04:19.389> fades<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.680> that

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
an output level trim which way I should

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.120 
an output level trim which way I should
get<00:04:43.810> back<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.169> faint<00:04:44.440> align<00:04:44.710> future

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
get back to the faint align future

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.710 
get back to the faint align future
what's<00:04:45.669> also<00:04:45.850> good<00:04:46.060> about<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.360> basil<00:04:46.630> on

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
what's also good about the basil on

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.650 
what's also good about the basil on
future<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:48.010> can<00:04:48.190> insert<00:04:48.639> into<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.270> at<00:04:49.419> line

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
future it you can insert into it at line

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.140 
future it you can insert into it at line
level<00:04:49.960> on<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.410> rear<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.979> if<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.190> want<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.669> if

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
level on the rear so if you want it if

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.680 
level on the rear so if you want it if
you<00:04:52.360> want<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.990> use<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.220> later<00:04:54.820> on<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.510> rather

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
you want to use it later on and rather

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.870 
you want to use it later on and rather
than<00:04:55.840> while<00:04:56.229> you're<00:04:56.440> actually<00:04:56.620> recording<00:04:57.490> you

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
than while you're actually recording you

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.640 
than while you're actually recording you
can<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.510> tap<00:04:58.720> into<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.199> rear<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.620> unit

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
can and tap into the rear of the unit

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.100 
can and tap into the rear of the unit
and<00:05:00.190> use<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.910> phase<00:05:01.120> alignment<00:05:01.360> feature<00:05:01.840> on

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
and use the phase alignment feature on

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.980 
and use the phase alignment feature on
its<00:05:02.290> own<00:05:02.440> without<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.860> microwave<00:05:03.990> another

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
its own without the microwave another

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.570 
its own without the microwave another
feature<00:05:05.169> we<00:05:05.470> have<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:05.710> output<00:05:06.040> level<00:05:06.340> trim

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
feature we have is output level trim

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.150 
feature we have is output level trim
which<00:05:06.729> comes<00:05:07.030> after<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.990> output<00:05:08.380> transformer

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
which comes after the output transformer

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.340 
which comes after the output transformer
so<00:05:09.850> you<00:05:10.300> can<00:05:10.539> turn<00:05:11.260> these<00:05:11.440> levels<00:05:11.770> up<00:05:12.300> really

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
so you can turn these levels up really

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.560 
so you can turn these levels up really
Roman<00:05:14.350> you<00:05:15.190> can<00:05:15.550> turn<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.880> levels<00:05:16.180> up<00:05:16.389> and

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
Roman you can turn the levels up and

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.629 
Roman you can turn the levels up and
really<00:05:16.960> saturate<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.710> output<00:05:18.039> transformer

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
really saturate the output transformer

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.790 
really saturate the output transformer
and<00:05:18.789> then<00:05:19.030> turn<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.510> level<00:05:19.810> down<00:05:19.960> after<00:05:20.680> the

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
and then turn the level down after the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.469 
and then turn the level down after the
output<00:05:21.160> transformer<00:05:21.820> nice<00:05:22.539> useful<00:05:23.020> feature

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
output transformer nice useful feature

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.600 
output transformer nice useful feature
and<00:05:25.479> as<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:26.410> say<00:05:26.620> it's<00:05:26.800> a<00:05:26.949> discrete<00:05:27.400> circuit

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
and as I say it's a discrete circuit

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.640 
and as I say it's a discrete circuit
path<00:05:27.970> completely<00:05:28.570> push<00:05:28.780> bowl<00:05:29.050> from<00:05:29.289> input<00:05:29.590> to

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
path completely push bowl from input to

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.350 
path completely push bowl from input to
output<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.449> think<00:05:31.810> that's<00:05:32.110> it
