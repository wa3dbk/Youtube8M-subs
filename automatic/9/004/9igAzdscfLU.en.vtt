something or something like that but he

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520 
something or something like that but he
actually<00:00:59.160> had<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.879> full<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.750> Scottish<00:01:01.199> squad

remember defenders of defending in the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.949 
remember defenders of defending in the
air<00:02:40.700> they<00:02:40.970> absolute<00:02:41.360> poor<00:02:41.630> when<00:02:41.810> they're

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959

attacking<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.650> seemed<00:02:42.890> likely<00:02:43.069> she<00:02:43.340> only<00:02:44.080> has

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
attacking it seemed likely she only has

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.199 
attacking it seemed likely she only has
had<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.709> decent<00:02:46.280> amount<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.790> fact<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.150> think

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
had a decent amount of fact I think

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.670 
had a decent amount of fact I think
she's<00:02:47.450> got<00:02:47.600> three<00:02:47.810> goals<00:02:48.050> from<00:02:48.170> an<00:02:48.319> hour<00:02:48.470> or

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
she's got three goals from an hour or

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.160 
she's got three goals from an hour or
two<00:02:49.010> goals<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.700> Roger<00:02:49.970> Johnson's<00:02:50.480> got<00:02:50.690> two<00:02:50.989> as

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
two goals and Roger Johnson's got two as

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.890 
two goals and Roger Johnson's got two as
well<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.340> good<00:02:52.610> attack<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.269> but<00:02:53.540> when<00:02:53.690> it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
well so the good attack in but when it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.180 
well so the good attack in but when it
doesn't<00:02:54.230> seem<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.709> very<00:02:54.799> good<00:02:55.069> in

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
doesn't seem like the very good in

thought when I played him he had a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.730 
thought when I played him he had a
hybrid<00:05:27.449> but<00:05:27.630> seeing<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:27.990> there<00:05:28.139> it's<00:05:28.380> actually

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
hybrid but seeing it there it's actually

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.360 
hybrid but seeing it there it's actually
a<00:05:28.770> Russian<00:05:29.099> squad<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.599> this<00:05:30.599> guy<00:05:31.370> started
