00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.840 

and<00:00:01.110> I'm<00:00:01.620> thinking<00:00:02.070> for<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> wall<00:00:03.600> color<00:00:04.110> scheme

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
and I'm thinking for a wall color scheme

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.140 
and I'm thinking for a wall color scheme
what<00:00:05.850> would<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.089> good<00:00:06.450> wall<00:00:06.750> color<00:00:07.230> scheme<00:00:07.710> be

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.509 

well<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.300> totally<00:00:12.660> optional<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.130> really

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
well it's totally optional to you really

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:25.750 
well it's totally optional to you really
it's<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> matter<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.929> preference

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.070 

so<00:00:26.760> make<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.570> doorway<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:30.080> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so make a little doorway like so it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.280 
so make a little doorway like so it
doesn't<00:00:31.500> look<00:00:31.560> too<00:00:31.830> bad

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.050 

well

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
well

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.230 
well
maybe<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:38.810> doesn't<00:00:38.990> have<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.260> be<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:39.620> high<00:00:40.240> well

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
maybe it doesn't have to be so high well

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.030 
maybe it doesn't have to be so high well
now<00:00:42.170> because<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.530> brings<00:00:42.650> me<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:42.890> another

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
now because that brings me to another

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.220 
now because that brings me to another
point<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.210> roof<00:00:45.220> which<00:00:46.220> I'll<00:00:46.430> touch<00:00:46.910> on<00:00:47.360> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
point the roof which I'll touch on a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.920 
point the roof which I'll touch on a
little<00:00:48.320> bit<00:00:48.830> later<00:00:49.220> but<00:00:50.150> we'll<00:00:50.330> go<00:00:50.480> ahead<00:00:50.600> and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
little bit later but we'll go ahead and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.220 
little bit later but we'll go ahead and
just<00:00:51.110> build<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.160> up<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.550> like<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.120> make<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
just build this up to like so make the

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:04.840 
just build this up to like so make the
four<00:00:54.530> exit<00:00:54.950> points<00:00:55.600> look<00:00:56.770> symmetrical<00:01:03.850> okay

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
four exit points look symmetrical okay

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:15.130 
four exit points look symmetrical okay
so<00:01:05.330> just<00:01:05.870> do<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.140> like<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:12.369> okay<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.080> now<00:01:15.080> we

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
so just do it like so okay and now we

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
so just do it like so okay and now we
can<00:01:15.710> build<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.250> walls

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 

it<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.080> depends<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it really depends on what you want the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.889 
it really depends on what you want the
walls<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:33.650> I'm<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.710> entirely<00:01:35.640> sure<00:01:35.869> what<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
walls to be I'm not entirely sure what I

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.910 
walls to be I'm not entirely sure what I
want<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> walls<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:38.250> I'll<00:01:39.530> let<00:01:40.530> me<00:01:40.680> see

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
want the walls to be I'll let me see

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.260 
want the walls to be I'll let me see
here

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.140 

hmm

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.090 

what<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:55.870> could<00:01:56.020> do<00:01:57.480> you<00:01:58.480> know<00:01:58.600> colors<00:01:59.440> have<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
what we could do you know colors have it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.670 
what we could do you know colors have it
has<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.370> subconscious<00:02:04.210> effect<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.380> brain

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.550 

so<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:09.009> color<00:02:09.280> palette<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.970> choose<00:02:10.540> kind<00:02:11.470> of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
so the color palette you choose kind of

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.970 
so the color palette you choose kind of
gives<00:02:11.860> an<00:02:12.100> impression<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.360> player<00:02:13.980> when

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
gives an impression to the player when

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.940 
gives an impression to the player when
they<00:02:15.100> first<00:02:15.430> join<00:02:15.550> your<00:02:15.940> server<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.950> depending

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
they first join your server so depending

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.680 
they first join your server so depending
on what<00:02:18.400> impression<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.120> give<00:02:19.420> will

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
on what impression you give will

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.350 
on what impression you give will
determine<00:02:20.640> whether<00:02:21.640> people<00:02:21.910> are<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.270> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
determine whether people are going to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.120 
determine whether people are going to
stay<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.690> server<00:02:22.930> or<00:02:23.140> not<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.920> use

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
stay on your server or not so if you use

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.550 
stay on your server or not so if you use
kind<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.460> like<00:02:24.580> bright<00:02:24.940> colors<00:02:25.560> happier

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
kind of like bright colors happier

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.310 
kind of like bright colors happier
colors<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.459> kind<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.820> makes<00:02:28.000> people<00:02:28.450> more<00:02:28.720> feel

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
here will be a tutorial section

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.390 
here will be a tutorial section
basically<00:05:36.970> what<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.570> what<00:05:37.870> not<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.199> do<00:05:38.590> to

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
basically what and what not to do to

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.600 
basically what and what not to do to
have<00:05:39.639> you<00:05:40.060> know<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.539> good<00:05:41.470> time<00:05:41.740> on<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.070> server

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
have you know a good time on the server

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.430 
have you know a good time on the server
and<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.520> that's<00:05:45.729> pretty<00:05:46.030> much<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.449> this<00:05:47.199> is

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
and so that's pretty much it this is

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.740 
and so that's pretty much it this is
basically<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.070> spawn<00:05:48.639> and<00:05:49.150> now<00:05:49.330> it<00:05:49.449> doesn't

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
basically the spawn and now it doesn't

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.990 
basically the spawn and now it doesn't
look<00:05:49.900> like<00:05:49.960> much<00:05:50.349> but<00:05:50.860> for<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.430> server<00:05:51.699> that

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
look like much but for the server that

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.040 
look like much but for the server that
I'm<00:05:52.150> making<00:05:52.599> which<00:05:53.199> is<00:05:53.380> a<00:05:53.409> pvp<00:05:54.690> rating<00:05:55.690> server

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
I'm making which is a pvp rating server

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.980 
I'm making which is a pvp rating server
you<00:05:56.830> don't<00:05:57.070> really<00:05:57.340> need<00:05:57.699> an<00:05:57.909> intricate<00:05:58.539> spawn

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
you don't really need an intricate spawn

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.460 
you don't really need an intricate spawn
so<00:05:59.979> when<00:06:00.310> they<00:06:00.430> jump<00:06:00.759> down<00:06:01.030> here

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
so when they jump down here

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.680 
so when they jump down here
um<00:06:03.100> you<00:06:03.580> don't<00:06:03.670> want<00:06:03.880> them<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.120> take<00:06:04.330> damage

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690

um you don't want them to take damage
