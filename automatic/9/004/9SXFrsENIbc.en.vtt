 I think she porcelain measau perry who 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.939
 decided to legalize and manufacture we 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.919
 pay income taxes and produce 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.449
 traditionally american drink 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.500
 thus preserving the national 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.660
 spirit 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.740
 main raw material service is corn 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.710
 grown 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.300

 yeast without which it can not do 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.640
 brewed in other containers 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.150
 the contents of two tanks mixed 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.000
 the resulting mixture wander and then 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.900
 there is a bulkhead aiming anwar al mabhu 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.790
 these are very strong risks if you look 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.910
 on the bottle tour the contents look like 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.240
 transparent and perfectly 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.020
 harmless 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.170
 but he has 10 mar characteristic taste 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 This is what he is most like. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.939

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.759

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.759
 want to be careful to do 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.000
 chuck miller of course we had no recipes 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.860
 from her late grandfather 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490
 who drove moonshine back in the dry years 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.620
 of the law 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.830
 before father it is thirties and 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.380
 not bad earned on this 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.130
 Miller wanted to renew 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.049
 brewing but did not want to have problems 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.799
 sber opa control alcohol and tobacco 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.799

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.610
 parking islands of childhood itself i 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.679
 spent a lot of time with a girl 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.249
 and he was busy quite a lot and I thought why 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.459
 I would not make money from the victims 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.400
 but I didn't want to have a problem with nature 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.700
 so I called and said that they say 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.160
 would like to open such a businessman they 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.020
 said the roads will only need to get 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.170

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.950

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.099
 when a man in the yard usually like 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.889
 arbitrary in the mountains where it was easier 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.919
 to hide 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.779
 the fact is that if you look at the map 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.619
 where are the shops in which 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.719
 my product is sold 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.969
