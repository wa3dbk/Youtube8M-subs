one point what could they be adding next
that's<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.609> doing<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.240> video<00:00:21.449> I'm

good diverse collection of attractions

good diverse collection of attractions
so<00:00:53.250> I'd<00:00:53.399> expect<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.000> same<00:00:54.270> diversity<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.199> the

so I'd expect the same diversity in the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
so I'd expect the same diversity in the
next<00:00:55.860> five<00:00:56.039> years<00:00:56.070> let's<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:56.969> start<00:00:57.149> off

receiving this next year so if your own
Park<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.740> sick<00:01:22.950> thugz<00:01:23.159> Grande<00:01:23.430> merica<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
Park is sick thugz Grande merica this is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
Park is sick thugz Grande merica this is
what<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:24.720> expect<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.290> park<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> receive

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
what I would expect the park to receive

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
what I would expect the park to receive
next<00:01:26.369> year<00:01:26.520> 2017<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> few<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:27.990> but

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
next year 2017 could be a few things but

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.510 
next year 2017 could be a few things but
I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.680> might<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.950> looking<00:01:29.280> at

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I think that we might be looking at

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
I think that we might be looking at
seeing<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.909> super<00:01:30.420> loop<00:01:30.630> come<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> park

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
seeing a super loop come to the park

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.620 
seeing a super loop come to the park
this<00:01:31.740> would<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:32.729> fit<00:01:33.240> they

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this would be a pretty good fit they

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.270 
this would be a pretty good fit they
could<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:33.990> another<00:01:34.290> thrill<00:01:34.680> ride<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
could use another thrill ride and of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
could use another thrill ride and of
course<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.119> six<00:01:36.420> bikes<00:01:36.570> works<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
course we know how six bikes works of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.390 
course we know how six bikes works of
course<00:01:37.380> we'll<00:01:37.590> try<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> market<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
course we'll try to market it as a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
course we'll try to market it as a
roller<00:01:38.700> coaster<00:01:38.790> even<00:01:39.390> though<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.689> know

roller coaster even though we all know
it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.710> everyone<00:01:40.799> kind<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it's not what everyone kind of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
it's not what everyone kind of
criticizes<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.000> things<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.570> things

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
criticizes these things but these things

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
criticizes these things but these things
really<00:01:43.079> aren't<00:01:43.409> bad<00:01:43.829> rides<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.820> only<00:01:45.000> thing

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
really aren't bad rides the only thing

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.460 
really aren't bad rides the only thing
that<00:01:45.299> stinks<00:01:45.509> about<00:01:45.689> them<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.140> Six<00:01:46.380> Flags

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
that stinks about them is when Six Flags

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.200 
that stinks about them is when Six Flags
tries<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> convince<00:01:47.369> us<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.880> their<00:01:48.000> roller

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
tries to convince us that their roller

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.780 
tries to convince us that their roller
coasters<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:49.140> course<00:01:49.409> may<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.590> by<00:01:49.829> 2017<00:01:50.520> Six

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
coasters of course may be by 2017 Six
Flags<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.420> over<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> whole<00:01:52.020> super

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
Flags is kind of over the whole super

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
Flags is kind of over the whole super
loop<00:01:52.740> thing<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.610> new<00:01:53.790> flat<00:01:54.149> ride<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.659> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
loop thing and a new flat ride will be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
loop thing and a new flat ride will be
hot<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.079> popular<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.070> might<00:01:56.280> install

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
hot and popular so they might install

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.789 
hot and popular so they might install
that<00:01:56.759> instead<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> 2015

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that instead as of right now in 2015

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
that instead as of right now in 2015
that<00:01:59.250> seems<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> good<00:01:59.939> possibility<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that seems like a good possibility and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
that seems like a good possibility and
if<00:02:00.990> Six<00:02:01.200> Flags<00:02:01.290> Great<00:02:01.560> America<00:02:01.680> were<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
if Six Flags Great America were to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.100 
if Six Flags Great America were to
receive<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> super<00:02:03.090> loop<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
receive a super loop then I think that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.780 
receive a super loop then I think that
you<00:02:04.200> could<00:02:04.380> expect<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.520> spot<00:02:05.759> where

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you could expect it in the spot where

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.600 
you could expect it in the spot where
ragin<00:02:06.420> Cajun<00:02:06.899> once<00:02:07.140> stood<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.979> 2018<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
ragin Cajun once stood and in 2018 I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.190 
ragin Cajun once stood and in 2018 I
think<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.179> we'll<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.390> seeing<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> next

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think that we'll be seeing the next

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.110 
think that we'll be seeing the next
roller<00:02:10.470> coaster<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.370> will<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.640> been<00:02:11.700> four

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
roller coaster this will have been four

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.650 
roller coaster this will have been four
years<00:02:12.150> since<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> last<00:02:12.930> Coast

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
years since the last Coast

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.090 
years since the last Coast
they<00:02:13.840> added<00:02:13.990> which<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.560> been<00:02:14.740> kalaiy

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
they added which will have been kalaiy

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.130 
they added which will have been kalaiy
ahthe<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.430> 2014<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.420> what<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.750> park<00:02:16.990> could

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
ahthe in 2014 and what the park could

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.590 
ahthe in 2014 and what the park could
use<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.890> really<00:02:18.640> good<00:02:18.880> multi<00:02:19.330> launch

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
use is a really good multi launch

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.380 
use is a really good multi launch
coaster<00:02:19.870> they<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.770> v2<00:02:21.100> vertical<00:02:21.820> velocity

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
coaster they have v2 vertical velocity

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.420 
coaster they have v2 vertical velocity
except<00:02:22.930> that's<00:02:23.110> an<00:02:23.320> intimate<00:02:23.860> impulse

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
except that's an intimate impulse

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.060 
except that's an intimate impulse
coaster<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> full<00:02:25.930> circuit<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.650> full

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
coaster it's not a full circuit a full

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.400 
coaster it's not a full circuit a full
circuit<00:02:27.670> coaster<00:02:28.090> by<00:02:28.210> premier<00:02:28.660> rides<00:02:28.960> would

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
circuit coaster by premier rides would

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.770 
circuit coaster by premier rides would
be<00:02:29.560> an<00:02:29.650> awesome<00:02:29.890> fit<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.640> 2019<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:31.660> that

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
be an awesome fit in 2019 I think that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.930 
be an awesome fit in 2019 I think that
they<00:02:31.870> should<00:02:32.050> expand<00:02:32.530> Hurricane<00:02:33.130> Harbor<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
they should expand Hurricane Harbor the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.400 
they should expand Hurricane Harbor the
last<00:02:34.090> time<00:02:34.270> they<00:02:34.420> will<00:02:34.540> have<00:02:34.570> expanded<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.260> was

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
last time they will have expanded it was

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.590 
last time they will have expanded it was
in<00:02:35.530> 2011<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.970> will<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.210> been<00:02:37.330> eight

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
in 2011 so this will have been eight

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.110 
in 2011 so this will have been eight
years<00:02:38.110> which<00:02:38.650> actually<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> long<00:02:39.550> time<00:02:39.850> so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
years which actually is a long time so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.460 
years which actually is a long time so
wouldn't<00:02:40.450> surprise<00:02:40.540> me<00:02:40.750> if<00:02:41.020> we<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.350> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
wouldn't surprise me if we see the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.560 
wouldn't surprise me if we see the
expansion<00:02:41.830> earlier<00:02:42.490> Hurricane<00:02:43.030> Harbor<00:02:43.240> is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
expansion earlier Hurricane Harbor is

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.940 
expansion earlier Hurricane Harbor is
one<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.810> those<00:02:43.960> water<00:02:44.200> parks<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.620> doesn't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
one of those water parks that doesn't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.100 
one of those water parks that doesn't
have<00:02:45.040> some<00:02:45.250> capsule<00:02:45.700> slides<00:02:46.000> we've<00:02:46.570> seen<00:02:46.840> Six

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
have some capsule slides we've seen Six

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.780 
have some capsule slides we've seen Six
Flags<00:02:47.230> install<00:02:47.710> some<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.950> those<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.340> previous

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
Flags install some of those at previous

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.520 
Flags install some of those at previous
parks<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.240> Six<00:02:49.480> Flags<00:02:49.570> New<00:02:49.810> England<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.290> six

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
parks like Six Flags New England at six

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.020 
parks like Six Flags New England at six
bikes<00:02:50.680> America<00:02:51.190> where<00:02:51.580> they<00:02:51.700> called<00:02:51.910> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
bikes America where they called it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.840 
bikes America where they called it
bonzai<00:02:52.630> pipelines<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.590> could<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.220> some<00:02:54.430> bonzai

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
bonzai pipelines I could see some bonzai

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.460 
bonzai pipelines I could see some bonzai
pipelines<00:02:55.300> going<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.780> at<00:02:55.960> Hurricane<00:02:56.350> Harbor

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470

at<00:02:56.770> Six<00:02:57.010> Flags<00:02:57.070> Great<00:02:57.400> America<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.240> finally<00:02:58.870> I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
at Six Flags Great America and finally I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.810 
at Six Flags Great America and finally I
think<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.350> they<00:02:59.470> should<00:02:59.500> add<00:02:59.890> some<00:03:00.280> family

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
think that they should add some family

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.880 
think that they should add some family

flying scooters at some fair parks these

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.900 
flying scooters at some fair parks these
are<00:03:05.350> great<00:03:05.590> family<00:03:06.070> attractions<00:03:06.580> they<00:03:06.730> don't

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
are great family attractions they don't

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.030 
are great family attractions they don't

the whole family can enjoy would work
great<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.650> concludes<00:03:12.100> my<00:03:12.310> five-year

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
great so that concludes my five-year

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.910 
great so that concludes my five-year
plan<00:03:13.120> for<00:03:13.150> Six<00:03:13.630> Flags<00:03:13.750> Great<00:03:14.050> America<00:03:14.230> if<00:03:14.740> I

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
plan for Six Flags Great America if I

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.560 
plan for Six Flags Great America if I
were<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.160> charge<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.640> park<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.390> is

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
were in charge of the park and this is

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.510 
were in charge of the park and this is
probably<00:03:16.900> what<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.410> would<00:03:17.740> do<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.160> think<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
probably what I would do I think that

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.920 
probably what I would do I think that
the<00:03:18.700> next<00:03:18.940> five<00:03:19.060> years<00:03:19.090> should<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.630> well

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
the next five years should be well

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.110 
the next five years should be well
rounded<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.770> I<00:03:20.860> think<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.280> my<00:03:21.520> predictions

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
rounded and I think that my predictions

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.570 
rounded and I think that my predictions
for<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.420> park<00:03:22.660> are<00:03:22.870> some<00:03:23.350> good<00:03:23.650> rides<00:03:24.130> because

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
for the park are some good rides because

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.190 
for the park are some good rides because
we're<00:03:24.850> seeing<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.150> new<00:03:25.270> roller<00:03:25.600> coaster<00:03:26.050> we're

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
we're seeing a new roller coaster we're

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.840 
we're seeing a new roller coaster we're
seeing<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.560> thrilling<00:03:26.950> flat<00:03:27.340> ride<00:03:27.580> and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
seeing a thrilling flat ride and

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.760 
seeing a thrilling flat ride and
expansion<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.660> waterpark<00:03:29.020> some<00:03:29.350> family

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
expansion to the waterpark some family

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.100 
expansion to the waterpark some family

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
rides and a dark ride as a good

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.530 
rides and a dark ride as a good
diversity<00:03:32.650> now<00:03:33.280> will<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:33.760> come<00:03:34.030> true<00:03:34.209> it's

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
diversity now will this come true it's

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.080 
diversity now will this come true it's
certainly<00:03:35.200> possible<00:03:35.530> but<00:03:36.040> often<00:03:36.520> times<00:03:36.700> parks

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090

for<00:03:37.240> me<00:03:37.330> unpredictable<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.350> when<00:03:38.470> you're

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
for me unpredictable and when you're

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.199 
for me unpredictable and when you're
looking<00:03:38.770> five<00:03:39.220> years<00:03:39.670> into<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.180> future

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
looking five years into the future

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.570 
looking five years into the future
that's<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.290> long<00:03:41.500> time<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:42.010> some<00:03:42.190> new<00:03:42.370> ride

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
that's a long time and some new ride

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.430 
that's a long time and some new ride
could<00:03:42.790> easily<00:03:43.090> come<00:03:43.510> along<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:44.080> new

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
could easily come along a new

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.050 
could easily come along a new
manufacturer<00:03:45.070> could<00:03:45.250> be<00:03:45.489> creating<00:03:45.970> the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
manufacturer could be creating the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.000 
manufacturer could be creating the
hottest<00:03:46.480> thing<00:03:46.720> some<00:03:47.320> ride<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.739> doesn't

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
hottest thing some ride that doesn't

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.620 
hottest thing some ride that doesn't
even<00:03:48.070> exist<00:03:48.340> right<00:03:48.850> now<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.300> course<00:03:49.450> I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
even exist right now so of course I

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.390 
even exist right now so of course I
can't<00:03:49.840> make<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.200> prediction<00:03:50.440> if<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.040> doesn't

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
can't make that prediction if it doesn't

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.180 
can't make that prediction if it doesn't
exist<00:03:51.760> right<00:03:51.850> now<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.510> as<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.840> 2015<00:03:53.530> looking

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
exist right now but as of 2015 looking

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.100 
exist right now but as of 2015 looking
into<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.459> future<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.420> what<00:03:55.780> would<00:03:55.900> make

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
into the future this is what would make

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.060 
into the future this is what would make
Six<00:03:56.470> Flags<00:03:56.590> Great<00:03:56.890> America<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.430> better<00:03:57.670> park
