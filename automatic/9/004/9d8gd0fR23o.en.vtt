florin a disappointing evening how do
you<00:00:01.890> reflect<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.460> Neil<00:00:02.610> Neil<00:00:02.760> draw<00:00:02.939> with

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090

you reflect on the Neil Neil draw with
west<00:00:03.120> ham<00:00:03.950> it<00:00:04.950> was<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.250> tough<00:00:05.700> game<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.270> think<00:00:07.020> we

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
west ham it was a tough game I think we

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.290 
west ham it was a tough game I think we
created<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.890> lot<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.069> chances<00:00:08.460> especially

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
created a lot of chances especially

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.839 
created a lot of chances especially
after<00:00:10.110> they<00:00:10.650> got<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.130> red<00:00:11.340> card<00:00:11.370> but

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
after they got a red card but

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.600 
after they got a red card but
unfortunately<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.870> didn't<00:00:13.080> score<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.610> would

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
unfortunately we didn't score so would

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
unfortunately we didn't score so would
you<00:00:14.730> put<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.000> lack<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.690> sharpness<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
you put that lack of sharpness in the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.599 
you put that lack of sharpness in the
box<00:00:16.859> down<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> tonight<00:00:17.550> oh<00:00:18.890> maybe<00:00:19.890> maybe<00:00:20.310> bad

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
box down to tonight oh maybe maybe bad

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.599 
box down to tonight oh maybe maybe bad
luck<00:00:20.850> may<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.260> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.529> concentrate<00:00:23.279> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
luck may be going to concentrate it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.759 
luck may be going to concentrate it
enough<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:25.199> things<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.710> this

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
enough but I think things like this

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.880 
enough but I think things like this
happen<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:27.480> previous<00:00:27.960> game<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.260> won<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
happen the previous game we won in the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.849 
happen the previous game we won in the
last<00:00:28.920> minutes<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.550> maybe<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.349> like

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
last minutes or maybe you want to like

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
last minutes or maybe you want to like
even<00:00:32.009> unlock<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> know<00:00:32.759> yeah<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
even unlock you know yeah because the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
even unlock you know yeah because the
chances<00:00:34.559> did<00:00:34.950> keep<00:00:35.190> coming<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> game<00:00:36.000> wore

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
chances did keep coming as the game wore

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
chances did keep coming as the game wore
on<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.050> case<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> maybe<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.680> bit

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
on but it was just a case of maybe a bit

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.209 
on but it was just a case of maybe a bit
of<00:00:37.860> luck<00:00:37.950> missing<00:00:38.460> tonight<00:00:38.820> yeah<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:40.920> me<00:00:41.070> say

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of luck missing tonight yeah like me say

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
of luck missing tonight yeah like me say
maybe<00:00:42.059> luck<00:00:42.329> maybe<00:00:42.629> weren't<00:00:43.250> composers

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
maybe luck maybe weren't composers

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
maybe luck maybe weren't composers
enough<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.329> create<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
enough because we create a lot of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
enough because we create a lot of
chances<00:00:46.530> fortunately<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.460> didn't<00:00:48.000> win<00:00:48.090> today

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
chances fortunately we didn't win today

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
chances fortunately we didn't win today
I<00:00:48.390> think<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.809> deserve<00:00:49.110> doing<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> defender

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I think we deserve doing as a defender

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
I think we deserve doing as a defender
you<00:00:50.760> must<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.270> price<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.230> West

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you must have some price for how West

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
you must have some price for how West
Ham<00:00:52.620> defended<00:00:53.070> especially<00:00:53.460> after<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.760> down

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Ham defended especially after going down

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.639 
Ham defended especially after going down
to<00:00:54.059> 10<00:00:54.239> men<00:00:54.270> yeah<00:00:55.309> normally<00:00:57.260> when<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.410> men

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
to 10 men yeah normally when your men

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.209 
to 10 men yeah normally when your men
down<00:00:59.539> that's<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> defendant<00:01:01.590> yeah

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
down that's what you do a defendant yeah

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.179 
down that's what you do a defendant yeah
they<00:01:02.370> did<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> good<00:01:02.910> job<00:01:02.989> unfortunately<00:01:04.189> how

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
they did a good job unfortunately how

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.859 
they did a good job unfortunately how
frustrating<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.820> when<00:01:06.030> you're<00:01:06.630> so

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
frustrating is it when you're so

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.120 
frustrating is it when you're so
dominant<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.740> you're<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:07.979> able

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
dominant in a game and you're not able

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.640 
dominant in a game and you're not able
to<00:01:08.369> take<00:01:08.549> advantage<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.380> very

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to take advantage it is it is very

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.740 
to take advantage it is it is very
frustrating<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:12.920> think<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.509> deserve<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> win

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
frustrating I think we deserve the win

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.740 
frustrating I think we deserve the win
today<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:17.090> like<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> said<00:01:18.360> before<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
today they like I said before the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.969 
today they like I said before the
defendant<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.290> good<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.920> even<00:01:20.600> surfaces<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
defendant very good in even surfaces and

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
defendant very good in even surfaces and
the<00:01:22.979> keeper<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.640> came<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> did<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> good<00:01:24.689> job

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the keeper that came in did a good job

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.219 
the keeper that came in did a good job
as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> feeling<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.720> case<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> two

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
as well so the feeling is a case of two

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.480 
as well so the feeling is a case of two
points<00:01:28.530> dropped<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> pick

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
points dropped but how do you pick

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.749

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
yourselves up his players it's not easy

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.289 
yourselves up his players it's not easy
of<00:01:32.970> course<00:01:34.250> now<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:35.939> pretty

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
of course now we have we have pretty

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
of course now we have we have pretty
much<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.110> play<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.890> weekend

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we'll try to keep on going and we have a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.359 
we'll try to keep on going and we have a
really<00:01:41.520> tough<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.140> someday<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.619> how

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really tough game someday so how

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.740 
really tough game someday so how
different<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> defender<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
different is it as a defender when you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.749 
different is it as a defender when you
are<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.350> dominant<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> game<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.610> have

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
are so dominant in the game and you have

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
are so dominant in the game and you have
to<00:01:47.880> stay<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.299> aware<00:01:48.590> defensively<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to stay so aware defensively don't you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
to stay so aware defensively don't you
yeah<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.939> course<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.420> easier<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.750> us

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
yeah it's a course it's easier for us

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.780 
yeah it's a course it's easier for us
because<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> run<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.610> much

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
because you don't have to run as much

we especially defense deserve for

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.170 
we especially defense deserve for
winning<00:04:00.770> a<00:04:00.860> sliver<00:04:01.070> purposes<00:04:01.640> it's<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.060> good

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180
