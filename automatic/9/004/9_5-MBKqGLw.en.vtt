00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.399
 to tell a joke today 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.580
 jaime I have 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:25.279
 we are getting into this other day in the 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:28.550
 Note that there is no note in the note 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.800
 told a guy like a restaurant but 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.449
 I went on the web to tell more things 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.860
 set sail but it serves a bad word 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.890
 to see perez medium strong is not to go to 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.260
 see it stories if they go to a guy eat or 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.260
 they will not be there but it's ugly you can tell 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.640
 I'm not going to two wigs you can tell 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.680
 wig 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.320
 you can not count it you can not count 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.370
 because you can not count because nothing 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 but I think that as you want because not 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.880
 you can tell but why 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.320
 because not because, in my opinion, it is not 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.320
 a joke to tell this time 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.119
 You can even count to see until you know 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 what do I want to see because they were 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.680
 the three on the radio note is pretty 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.320
 I left the joke I heard the other day 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.840
 you can tell how to count yes but it's 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.770
 steep 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.539
 the dreadlocks and it does not have a strong ending and 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.539
 count to the end does not work 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.140
 tell me how it starts from how it is 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.140
 how the lady starts 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.030
 look at a knife 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.299
 the letter tells him not to bring him a 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.890
 knife brings you the knife 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.430
 the type grip knives 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.569

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.569

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.380

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.820

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.120
 miter my very arrogant integrity 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.580

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.860
 main a fork 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.769
 since I had half fed up I took lady 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.680
 the fork to be given to the fork by cunning 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.450
 fork so good now they put fib 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.610
 anywhere worse it scares me human 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.380
 why sometimes to grab the fork 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.600
 it smells so scared and 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.860
 in that pact to the dismissal that you have 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.050
 fatal but yes with a little bit of faith 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.880
 verdeos sauce and chips with those of 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.660
 oven and smelling he asked so 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.480

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.260
 believe it brings you the main course yes as 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.270
 Mr. 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.810

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.810

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.230
 3 - spoon says 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 expected where contact wire on the web 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.750
 if it is now you can put one after 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.390
 then later on another 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.850
 and not like giving the spoon but not 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.450

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.490
 if you go to the kitchen no no no no no no no 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.280
 the kitchen does not go with the spoon because I 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.570
 I was fed up and I know what's going on and that's what 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.760
 would any client like that if you are 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.739
 mosso and you have a client towards the spoon 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.800
 when releasing the spoon no no no no no no 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.769
 grab the spoon and I can imagine 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.640
 well but if you can not look it up in the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.840
 prohibited part of the web 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.840
