00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 if you are a fan of mario kart and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.930
 this should interest you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.440
 since the battle card has opened its 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.450
 doors 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.570
 implanted at dottignies in a hangar of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.179
 5000 sqm battle card is a video game 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.230
 life-size mixing karting and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.480
 augmented reality 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 it took five years for young people 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.020
 contractors otherwise genius of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.750
 computing to make this happen 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.199
 project a little crazy and seems unique to the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.279
 world 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.320
 christine black ni and guillaume dujardin 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.369
 the aemo chrono to the other montois all 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.380
 two gathered around a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 innovative project a racing game in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.219
 full-size karting thanks to a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 virtual environment projected on the ground 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.020
 the idea of battles card was born in 2010 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 two years before the two friends 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.140
 meet then the idea is there 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.370
 soon five years I was the entrance between 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 mouscron and turned I go back to my 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.129
 side I was looking for ideas for a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.230
 contest I have the idea to put a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.480
 laser gun on a kart for the purpose 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 to make the map really fun and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.539
 the idea she evolved evolve as my 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 last two years of study 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.250
 I ended up winning a competition water 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 and then even a second and then I 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.010
 met ludovic we decided to get 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 throw at 2 in the adventures full time 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.840
 three years ago a year after the first 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 conclusive tests Sebastian elected life 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.420
 that have started looking for a 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.939
 operating site 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 they find him at dottignies the hangar 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.740
 of 5000 mÂ² which belonged to the redoubt 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 is the ideal place for their track 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.790
 virtual karting then the principle in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.140
 do we take a big guy we dive 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.400
 completely in the dark and in them 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.110
 actually a projector set for 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.579
 project the track there is no price 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.990
 track really traced with tires 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.220
 it's really the projection that goes 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 draw the layout and the environment 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.250
 in which will evolve the players and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.180
 what's really strong is that we 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.320
 so is able to change 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 the environment at each race 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.229
 so we arrive in situations 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.880
 completely crazy with races 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.610
 crazy with weapon bonuses 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.710
 shields to compare to karting at 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 level of conduct sadrists a lot 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 the more it slips a lot more and then 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.369
 all that is the interactions and that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.060
 the soil that is that here it is 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.399
 projected so 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.420
 so it's really very minimal and flex 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.380
 quite impressive the roadside 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 the items 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.189
 all this is really millimeter 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.659
 frankly it works well me who 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.710
 have already done karting sensations 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.450
 are completely different 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.910
 I think it's really accessible to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 all because it's not so violent 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.069
 that karting 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 it does not hurt the arm it does not hurt 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.410
 on the back then I'm adept with my 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.500
 friends of the mario kart who is known this is 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.019
 c really is what one really feels 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.280
 that we are stupid and in the game we have 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.900
 always an eye on the road an eye 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.909
 on the screen 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.230
 actually it works well when 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.980
 we are touched when we touch 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.019
 roadside 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.189
 this is really his family of 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.860
 advice to all it's really excellent 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.959
 battle carto cost 1 million euros 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.790
 a huge sum but the two young 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.890
 entrepreneurs were able to count on 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 private and public financiers who believed 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.689
 to their project sÃ©bastien ludovic aims 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.819
 three types of clientele families 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.340
 companies and passionate about 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.099
 video games and this in a radius of 100 to 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.209
 200 km so it's unique in belgium 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.290
 but it's unique in the whole world 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.090
 since in fact we developed the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.470
 product and we patented it so we 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.400
 our goal is to put in 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.290
 road this first showcase 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.430
 what is done and we are already working in 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.530
 does on getting started others 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.950
 other centers battle map to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.950
 overseas
