00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 my name is max maya the rock'n roll 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.890
 vegan ostfriesland and you have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.930
 tuned and do not betray today 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 recipe from my third cookbook 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.270
 Project the cockpit, however, is only 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.440
 next year, but appear for you 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.800
 Here's the video 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.980
 There are choppers today and that is you 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 go and free soy and that's what we need 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.860
 more children because the color comes 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.649
 of about minced meat in the structure 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.320
 pretty close and the advantage is with that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 drive in charisma 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:57.710
 they have 26 6 grams of protein on 100 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.750
 gram lenses so more or 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 yes one more than one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.790
 beef pulls her very well 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.290
 then we still need black pepper 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 from the mill marjoram paprika noble sweet 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 caraway herb salt namely in this 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.619
 case could also just more salt 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 exceed the rate of use as a binder 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.140
 I 've taken two yolks now because 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.170
 I think the superclass you can find 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.770
 but you can also do a lot of loading 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.420
 free binders such as 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.540
 take potato starch 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.080
 then I have a little here 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.299
 onion some garlic gluten-free per 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.369
 e mail 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.170
 capa da a film series is not what 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.189
 is missing of course by means 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.020
 Spicy mustard first we go 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.900
 ruthenberg ad forgot to say 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 they are of course precooked in 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.390
 vegetable broth have about 25 minutes 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.470
 let them come until they are so hard 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.470
 drip off and in which mixa 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:29.420
 then the marjoram in this case 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:29.420
 Teaspoon grind a bit more 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.800
 quietly I would have to be the bubble 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.290
 that may have a bit of booms 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.290
 then a spoon of sweet paprika 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:08.730
 some caraway then ground herbal salt 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:10.650
 where I also so 34 gram then the small one 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.920
 onion I know already is in the intended 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.690
 have the thermomix or any other 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.799
 power mixa also by the small one 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.560
 swap no problem 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.730
 if necessary, that could even start for her 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.470
 to make a vessel 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.799
 Now we are giving in money as 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:33.900

 teaspoon mustard pure 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.690

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.989
 love like you can utilize 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.590

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.590
