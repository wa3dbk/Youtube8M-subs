a little bit beat up the nose of the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.709 
a little bit beat up the nose of the
bait<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.879> know<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> weren't<00:01:00.329> grind

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
in those shells that real hard bottom
you<00:01:03.059> weren't<00:01:03.300> getting<00:01:03.449> bit

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you weren't getting bit

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.660 
you weren't getting bit
so<00:01:04.170> again<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.860> catching<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> bunch<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.460> three

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so again just catching a bunch of three

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
so again just catching a bunch of three
pounders<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.479> getting<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> solid<00:01:07.229> limit

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pounders out there getting a solid limit

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
pounders out there getting a solid limit
and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.250> I'd<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.549> shallow<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.210> there's
