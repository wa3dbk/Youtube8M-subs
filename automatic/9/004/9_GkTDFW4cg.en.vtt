00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.600
 although it is a project carried out 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.639
 I have finally decided for some time 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 to dedicate a few hours to see 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.840
 what will become of the next unreal tournament 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.269
 which will have no denomination 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 particular if not simply unreal 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.350
 tournament in the current pre alpha 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.180
 we will be able to orient ourselves a little bit already 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.460
 and to understand broadly what 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.019
 we should expect from this hopefully 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.580
 rebirth 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.109
 definitely the most feature 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 interesting will be that of a game 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 100% free and not pay to 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.579
 win 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.120
 as the team of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.100
 development essentially will exist indeed is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 already available in embryonic phase a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 marketplace where the information will be available 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 user creations then skin of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.469
 weapons coloration armor objects e 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.530
 anything else that will not affect you anyway 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 on gameplay and will not offer advantages 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.430
 we'll see if this new way of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.320
 making the epic will be the right thing 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.059
 indeed if you want to try to armament reality 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 you can also download it now directly 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.859
 from the official website the link is in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.080
 description many of the maps present 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.240
 they will not be for obvious reasons yet 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.400
 complete so there will be many missing 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 details and textures but just a little for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 to be able to appreciate the new graphic engine 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.270
 the real engine iv was interesting 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
 notice how this graphics engine is 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 was immediately made free for this purpose 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 non-commercial is provided with numerous 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.430
 official instruction guides for 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.220
 start using it immediately but 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.750
 back to the game with great pleasure yes 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.250
 they will be able to find almost all the weapons 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.439
 classics present in the old chapters 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.549
 some remained unchanged 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.860
 others with some details 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.110
 different the first thing that comes to me 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.759
 mind is the megane equipped with fire 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.520
 normal classical and secondary 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.619
 composed of small blue Razeti in grade 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.110
 besides doing some damage to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.170
 allow a mini rocket jump along the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.509
 walls or bounce on the walls what I do 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 has convinced little of the standard weapons it is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.740
 was a function of the rifle of 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.360
 precision those red circles around 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.969
 to the heads I would n't know how 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.130
 interpret them also because some are removed 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.560
 cases the sniper rifle on unreal 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.259
 it is used without optics but with the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.380
 standard lattice I do not understand what 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.540
 they wanted to do with this choice 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.610
 as in the previous chapters they will be 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.980
 present side jumps and possibilities 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.300
 to make rocket jump like any good arena 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.160
 should do 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.410
 moreover many others have been added 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.930
 small moves including the newest one 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.610
 wall ride that is the walk on the walls in 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.110
 so that it can extend e 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.900
 make it more dynamic and fast 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.820
 fortunately a jump along a wall 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.860
 the gameplay style has remained 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.870
 more or less unchanged maintaining that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.360
 simplicity characteristic immediacy 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.700
 of the unreal series as told by one of the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.560
 unreal project leader is one of those 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.900
 games where anyone understands dynamics 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.700
 movements and controls with ease but 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.790
 with extreme difficulty it is a long time 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.890
 will be able to refine the technique and the skill the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.030
 graphic engine although of opinion 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.970
 that a good arena must be 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 minimalist not bad indeed makes a lot 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.780
 enjoyable gaming experience 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.130
 I imagine that even in this video yes 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.620
 they can already appreciate the qualities 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.660
 real engine techniques 4 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.640
 the only thing I don't know whether to define 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.890
 an additional pitfall or simply 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.620
 the passages are a big nuisance 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.420
 quick from the inside to the outside of 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.730
 some structure and vice versa 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.590
 in fact, as happens in reality, we will be 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.140
 blinded by the glare of the outgoing sun 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.940
 and overwhelmed by the incoming darkness there 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.980
 we should live with or remain one 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.870
 game feature 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.460
 it's probably still very early for 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.530
 give in-depth reviews of its reality 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.330
 arment also because it is always about 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.830
 a pre alpha but I'm sure already 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.500
 now it does quite well what it is 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.970
 will be the game after quake live that 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.280
 unfortunately in recent times there has been 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.050
 lost something on the road a little bit all 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.760
 old guard hopes to get back in between 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.760
 hands a game where the only element of 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.830
 relief will be the pure gameplay or ti 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.350
 promises this together a seasoning 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.880
 very pleasant of graphic effects 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.580
 obtained with his new is presents 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.410
 beautiful graphic engine the idea of 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.420
 epic is to bring back the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.370
 glorious saganne rial and recover 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.490
 that market share in sports that 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.190
 in recent years it has failed him 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.660
 personally I really hope so much 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.340
 here is everything for today from france 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.340
 let's review the next video
