00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
respiration and then you have another

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.840 
respiration and then you have another
important<00:02:35.590> muscle<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.010> respiration<00:02:36.459> which

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
important muscle in respiration which

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.849 
important muscle in respiration which
are<00:02:37.030> known<00:02:37.209> as<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> intercostal<00:02:38.470> muscles

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
are known as the intercostal muscles

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.599 
are known as the intercostal muscles
which<00:02:39.489> run<00:02:39.850> between<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.540> ribs<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:42.430> I'm

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
which run between the ribs here I'm

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.000 
which run between the ribs here I'm
drawing<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> trachea<00:02:43.510> which<00:02:43.780> connect<00:02:44.319> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
drawing the trachea which connect the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.770 
drawing the trachea which connect the
larynx<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.239> lungs

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.930 

so<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.110> very<00:02:51.140> simplified<00:02:51.980> way<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.520> rescue

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
so in a very simplified way the rescue

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.540 
so in a very simplified way the rescue
center<00:02:53.330> will<00:02:53.480> send<00:02:53.750> impulses<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.100> muscles

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
center will send impulses to the muscles

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.050 
center will send impulses to the muscles
of<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.760> lungs<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.890> trigger<00:02:57.910> inspiration<00:02:58.910> or

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
of the lungs to trigger inspiration or

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.050 
of the lungs to trigger inspiration or
expiration<00:03:00.460> so<00:03:01.460> for<00:03:01.730> example<00:03:02.620> here<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:03.650> have

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
expiration so for example here we have

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.360 
expiration so for example here we have
impulses<00:03:05.060> being<00:03:05.360> sent<00:03:05.750> via<00:03:06.170> neurons<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.340> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
impulses being sent via neurons to the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.310 
impulses being sent via neurons to the
intercostal<00:03:08.300> muscles<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.870> close<00:03:09.110> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
intercostal muscles to close the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.310 
intercostal muscles to close the
inspiration<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.850> ribs<00:03:11.150> will<00:03:11.510> rise<00:03:11.810> and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
inspiration so the ribs will rise and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.070 
inspiration so the ribs will rise and
the<00:03:13.160> impulses<00:03:13.790> are<00:03:13.910> also<00:03:14.030> being<00:03:14.390> sent<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
the impulses are also being sent to the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.830 
the impulses are also being sent to the
diaphragm<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:16.040> cause<00:03:16.250> inspiration<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
diaphragm to cause inspiration so the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.110 
diaphragm to cause inspiration so the
diaphragm<00:03:18.260> will<00:03:18.950> descend<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.700> respiratory

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
diaphragm will descend the respiratory

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.030 
diaphragm will descend the respiratory
center<00:03:23.750> will<00:03:24.140> send<00:03:24.770> impulses<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:26.270> cause

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
center will send impulses to cause

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
center will send impulses to cause
inspiration<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.960> expiration<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:31.190> more<00:03:31.520> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
inspiration and expiration the more the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.860 
inspiration and expiration the more the
quicker<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.720> impulse<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.940> faster<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
quicker the impulse the faster the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.460 
quicker the impulse the faster the
breathing<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:37.400> slower<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.090> impulse<00:03:38.690> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
breathing the slower the impulse the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.810 
breathing the slower the impulse the
slower<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.280> breathing<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:42.670> that's<00:03:43.670> the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
slower the breathing and that's the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.080 
slower the breathing and that's the
important<00:03:44.180> concept<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.630> understand<00:03:45.520> now<00:03:46.520> let

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
important concept to understand now let

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780 
important concept to understand now let
us<00:03:47.120> see<00:03:47.480> what<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:48.050> influence<00:03:48.830> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
us see what can influence the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.370 
us see what can influence the
respiratory<00:03:50.540> center<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.370> what<00:03:52.880> can

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
respiratory center and so what can

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.220 
respiratory center and so what can
increase<00:03:54.380> our<00:03:55.070> respiration<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.720> increase

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
increase our respiration so increase

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.350 
increase our respiration so increase
breathing<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:57.950> what<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.820> suppress

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
breathing and what can suppress

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.100 
breathing and what can suppress
breathing<00:03:59.990> so<00:04:00.440> slow<00:04:00.770> down<00:04:01.010> breathing<00:04:02.110> firstly

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
breathing so slow down breathing firstly

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.130 
breathing so slow down breathing firstly
we<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.620> higher<00:04:03.890> centers<00:04:04.460> of<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:04.700> brain

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
we have the higher centers of the brain

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.490 
we have the higher centers of the brain
which<00:04:06.490> which<00:04:07.490> where<00:04:08.150> we<00:04:08.270> can<00:04:08.480> have<00:04:08.660> voluntary

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
which which where we can have voluntary

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.270 
which which where we can have voluntary
control

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
control

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.240 
control
so<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.840> know<00:04:12.050> we<00:04:12.320> have<00:04:12.590> some<00:04:12.800> control<00:04:13.160> over

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
so as we know we have some control over

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.100 
so as we know we have some control over
our<00:04:13.670> breathing<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:14.240> can<00:04:14.420> stop<00:04:14.720> breathing<00:04:15.080> for

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
our breathing we can stop breathing for

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.530 
our breathing we can stop breathing for
a<00:04:15.320> while<00:04:15.560> before<00:04:15.920> our<00:04:16.280> how<00:04:16.549> before<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.270> brain

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
a while before our how before the brain

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.410 
a while before our how before the brain
just<00:04:17.720> takes<00:04:17.989> over

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
just takes over

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.360 
just takes over
the<00:04:20.420> higher<00:04:20.660> centers<00:04:21.290> of<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.770> brain<00:04:21.890> are<00:04:22.130> also

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
the higher centers of the brain are also

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.280 
the higher centers of the brain are also
important<00:04:23.180> for<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.420> perception<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.020> pain

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
important for the perception of pain

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.610 
important for the perception of pain
emotion<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.040> temperature<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.450> all<00:04:26.840> these

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
emotion and temperature and so all these

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.710 
emotion and temperature and so all these
factors<00:04:28.210> can<00:04:29.260> influence<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:31.720> respiratory

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
factors can influence the respiratory

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.150 
factors can influence the respiratory
rate<00:04:33.290> so<00:04:33.890> they<00:04:34.190> will<00:04:34.460> firstly<00:04:35.240> either

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
rate so they will firstly either

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.590 
rate so they will firstly either
stimulate<00:04:37.160> or<00:04:37.310> suppress<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:38.000> pontine

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
stimulate or suppress the pontine

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.010 
stimulate or suppress the pontine
respiratory<00:04:39.200> center<00:04:39.620> which<00:04:40.250> then<00:04:40.580> will

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
respiratory center which then will

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.390 
respiratory center which then will
stimulate<00:04:42.020> or<00:04:42.410> suppress<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.010> medullary

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
stimulate or suppress the medullary

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.490 
stimulate or suppress the medullary
respiratory<00:04:43.970> center<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.540> respiration

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
respiratory center and respiration

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.890 
respiratory center and respiration
itself<00:04:47.590> but<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.770> main<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.570> regulator<00:04:50.570> or

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
itself but the main a regulator or

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.130 
itself but the main a regulator or
influencer<00:04:51.710> of<00:04:51.740> respiration<00:04:52.340> will<00:04:52.760> be<00:04:53.140> the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
influencer of respiration will be the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.990 
influencer of respiration will be the
peripheral<00:04:54.770> chemoreceptors<00:04:54.980> which<00:04:55.850> are

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
peripheral chemoreceptors which are

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.800 
peripheral chemoreceptors which are
located<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.720> carotid<00:04:57.380> na<00:04:57.620> Arctic<00:04:57.979> bodies

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
located in the carotid na Arctic bodies

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.559 
located in the carotid na Arctic bodies
they<00:04:59.810> detect<00:05:00.290> changes<00:05:00.979> in<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.580> blood<00:05:01.790> Kim

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
they detect changes in the blood Kim

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.320 
they detect changes in the blood Kim
changes<00:05:03.080> in<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.289> blood<00:05:03.499> so<00:05:04.309> for<00:05:04.520> example<00:05:05.089> if

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
changes in the blood so for example if

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.570 
changes in the blood so for example if
they<00:05:05.629> detect<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.229> decrease<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.919> oxygen<00:05:07.279> a

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
they detect a decrease in oxygen a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.999 
they detect a decrease in oxygen a
decrease<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.449> blood<00:05:08.809> pH<00:05:09.259> which<00:05:09.649> means<00:05:09.919> an

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
decrease in blood pH which means an

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.949 
decrease in blood pH which means an
increase<00:05:10.339> in<00:05:10.490> hydrogen<00:05:10.759> ions<00:05:11.179> and<00:05:11.389> an

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:11.959 
increase in hydrogen ions and an

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.549 
increase in hydrogen ions and an
increase<00:05:12.499> in<00:05:12.529> up<00:05:12.889> in<00:05:13.369> co2<00:05:14.169> this<00:05:15.169> will

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:15.559 
increase in up in co2 this will

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.790 
increase in up in co2 this will
stimulate<00:05:16.189> or<00:05:16.819> trigger<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.449> chemoreceptors

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
stimulate or trigger the chemoreceptors

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.559 
stimulate or trigger the chemoreceptors
located<00:05:18.800> here<00:05:19.279> in<00:05:19.429> the<00:05:19.639> carotid<00:05:20.059> bodies<00:05:20.360> and

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
located here in the carotid bodies and

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.559 
located here in the carotid bodies and
aortic<00:05:21.169> bodies<00:05:21.709> and<00:05:21.949> they<00:05:22.759> will<00:05:22.909> stimulate

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
aortic bodies and they will stimulate

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.879 
aortic bodies and they will stimulate
these<00:05:24.199> Keogh<00:05:25.159> receptors<00:05:25.819> to<00:05:26.589> stimulate<00:05:27.589> the

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
these Keogh receptors to stimulate the

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.459 
these Keogh receptors to stimulate the
rest<00:05:28.159> recenter<00:05:28.789> and<00:05:29.059> so<00:05:29.929> when<00:05:30.319> the

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
rest recenter and so when the

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.209 
rest recenter and so when the
respiratory<00:05:30.889> center<00:05:31.399> is<00:05:31.459> stimulated<00:05:33.219> there

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
respiratory center is stimulated there

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.100 
respiratory center is stimulated there
will<00:05:34.339> be<00:05:34.369> a<00:05:34.429> quicker<00:05:34.849> respiratory<00:05:35.629> rate<00:05:35.839> so

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
will be a quicker respiratory rate so

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.350 
will be a quicker respiratory rate so
you<00:05:36.169> will<00:05:36.409> breathe<00:05:36.740> in<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.430> breathe<00:05:38.300> out

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
you will breathe in and breathe out

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.350 
you will breathe in and breathe out
quicker<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.259> so<00:05:40.069> you<00:05:40.159> can<00:05:40.550> breathe<00:05:40.789> in<00:05:41.029> more

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
quicker and so you can breathe in more

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.359 
quicker and so you can breathe in more
oxygen<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.319> can<00:05:42.499> breathe<00:05:42.740> out<00:05:42.889> more

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:43.369 
oxygen and you can breathe out more

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:51.560 
oxygen and you can breathe out more
carbon<00:05:43.759> dioxide<00:05:43.789> to<00:05:44.689> neutralize<00:05:45.409> everything

respiratory<00:06:13.590> center<00:06:13.950> so<00:06:14.100> that<00:06:14.250> you<00:06:14.340> could

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
respiratory center so that you could

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.210 
respiratory center so that you could
breathe<00:06:14.790> faster<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:15.600> thereby<00:06:16.500> breathing<00:06:17.040> out

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
breathe faster and thereby breathing out

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.760 
breathe faster and thereby breathing out
more<00:06:17.670> carbon<00:06:18.000> dioxide<00:06:18.720> and<00:06:18.870> inhaling<00:06:19.530> more

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
more carbon dioxide and inhaling more

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.660 
more carbon dioxide and inhaling more
oxygen<00:06:21.320> you<00:06:22.320> also<00:06:22.470> have<00:06:22.710> receptors<00:06:23.100> in<00:06:23.520> your

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
oxygen you also have receptors in your

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.060 
oxygen you also have receptors in your
muscles<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.390> your<00:06:24.570> joints<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:25.140> these

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
muscles and in your joints and these

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.700 
muscles and in your joints and these
will<00:06:26.580> be<00:06:26.610> stimulated<00:06:27.450> when<00:06:27.600> you<00:06:27.750> exercise<00:06:28.140> and

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
will be stimulated when you exercise and

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.460 
will be stimulated when you exercise and
so<00:06:29.310> when<00:06:29.430> you<00:06:29.490> exercise<00:06:29.850> these<00:06:30.780> receptors

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
so when you exercise these receptors

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.220 
so when you exercise these receptors
will<00:06:31.710> stimulate<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.880> respiratory<00:06:33.720> center<00:06:34.080> so

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
will stimulate the respiratory center so

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.890 
will stimulate the respiratory center so
you<00:06:34.290> can<00:06:34.500> breathe<00:06:34.890> quicker<00:06:35.520> and<00:06:35.900> it's

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
you can breathe quicker and it's

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.390 
you can breathe quicker and it's
important<00:06:37.410> to<00:06:37.500> breathe<00:06:37.710> quicker<00:06:38.070> when<00:06:38.310> you

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
important to breathe quicker when you

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.970 
important to breathe quicker when you
exercise<00:06:38.880> so<00:06:39.090> you<00:06:39.180> can<00:06:39.330> breathe<00:06:39.840> so<00:06:40.770> that<00:06:40.890> you

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
exercise so you can breathe so that you

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.250 
exercise so you can breathe so that you
can<00:06:41.100> take<00:06:41.340> in<00:06:41.520> more<00:06:41.670> oxygen<00:06:41.730> and<00:06:42.390> you<00:06:42.870> can<00:06:43.050> blow

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
can take in more oxygen and you can blow

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.690 
can take in more oxygen and you can blow
out<00:06:43.440> all<00:06:43.710> the<00:06:43.890> acid<00:06:44.580> that<00:06:44.610> has<00:06:44.790> built<00:06:45.060> up<00:06:45.270> and

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
out all the acid that has built up and

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.310 
out all the acid that has built up and
finally<00:06:47.700> you<00:06:47.820> have<00:06:48.000> things<00:06:48.480> in<00:06:48.750> your<00:06:48.900> lungs

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
finally you have things in your lungs

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.730 
finally you have things in your lungs
that<00:06:49.740> can<00:06:50.160> regulate<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.630> respiratory<00:06:52.110> center

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
that can regulate the respiratory center

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.230 
that can regulate the respiratory center
they<00:06:52.860> can<00:06:52.980> influence<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.880> respiratory

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
they can influence the respiratory

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.900 
they can influence the respiratory
center<00:06:54.720> in<00:06:54.810> the<00:06:54.900> brain<00:06:55.200> stem<00:06:55.790> firstly<00:06:56.790> you

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
center in the brain stem firstly you

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.940 
center in the brain stem firstly you
have<00:06:57.030> things<00:06:57.270> called<00:06:57.510> irritant<00:06:58.230> receptors

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
have things called irritant receptors

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.210 
have things called irritant receptors
which<00:06:59.280> are<00:07:00.050> receptors<00:07:01.050> that<00:07:01.410> are<00:07:01.620> protective

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
which are receptors that are protective

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.390 
which are receptors that are protective
in<00:07:02.430> the<00:07:02.520> lungs<00:07:02.760> that<00:07:03.000> help<00:07:04.040> essentially<00:07:05.040> blow

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
in the lungs that help essentially blow

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.550 
in the lungs that help essentially blow
off<00:07:05.580> the<00:07:05.760> irritant<00:07:06.180> and<00:07:06.450> so<00:07:07.020> when<00:07:07.350> they<00:07:07.500> are

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
off the irritant and so when they are

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.190 
off the irritant and so when they are
stimulated<00:07:07.920> they<00:07:08.310> will<00:07:08.460> suppress<00:07:09.200> the

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
stimulated they will suppress the

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.750 
stimulated they will suppress the
respiratory<00:07:10.500> center<00:07:10.980> to<00:07:11.190> slow<00:07:11.520> down

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
respiratory center to slow down

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.180 
respiratory center to slow down
respiration<00:07:12.540> and<00:07:12.720> then<00:07:13.590> you<00:07:13.680> have<00:07:13.830> stretch

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
respiration and then you have stretch

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.760 
respiration and then you have stretch
receptors<00:07:14.790> in<00:07:15.000> the<00:07:15.120> lungs<00:07:15.330> which<00:07:15.630> cause<00:07:16.560> the

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
receptors in the lungs which cause the

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.760 
receptors in the lungs which cause the
hearing<00:07:17.160> braver<00:07:17.520> reflex<00:07:18.150> a<00:07:18.500> reflex<00:07:19.500> that<00:07:19.590> is

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
hearing braver reflex a reflex that is

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.460 
hearing braver reflex a reflex that is
protective<00:07:20.460> it's<00:07:21.030> a<00:07:21.120> protective<00:07:21.660> reflex

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
protective it's a protective reflex

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.790 
protective it's a protective reflex
initiated<00:07:23.400> by<00:07:23.580> extreme<00:07:24.180> over<00:07:24.990> inflation<00:07:25.470> of

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
initiated by extreme over inflation of

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.820 
initiated by extreme over inflation of
the<00:07:25.980> lungs<00:07:26.220> and<00:07:26.610> so<00:07:27.300> when<00:07:28.230> these<00:07:28.440> stretch

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
the lungs and so when these stretch

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.970 
the lungs and so when these stretch
receptors<00:07:29.400> are<00:07:29.580> stimulated<00:07:30.500> initiated<00:07:31.500> they

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:31.980 
receptors are stimulated initiated they

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.670 
receptors are stimulated initiated they
will<00:07:32.370> suppress<00:07:33.200> respirations<00:07:34.200> so<00:07:34.410> they<00:07:34.530> will

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
will suppress respirations so they will
