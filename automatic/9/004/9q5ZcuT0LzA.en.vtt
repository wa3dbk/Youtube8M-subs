or<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> increase<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> decreases<00:01:54.899> that's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
or you can increase the decreases that's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.120 
or you can increase the decreases that's
really<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.549> save<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:58.130> project

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really up to you now save to project

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030 
really up to you now save to project
directory<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.439> mean<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.890> will

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
directory now this is this mean it will

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
directory now this is this mean it will
save<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.790> whatever<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.270> save<00:02:03.540> your<00:02:03.780> your

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
save it to whatever you save your your

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
save it to whatever you save your your
project<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> only<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> save<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.540> once

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
project so you only have to save it once

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.580 
project so you only have to save it once
and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.380> I'll<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.649> will<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.959> symbol

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and then I'll just will know the symbol

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.780 
and then I'll just will know the symbol
for<00:02:10.619> d<00:02:10.830> will<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.550> save<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
for d will know that you want to save it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.980 
for d will know that you want to save it
at<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> same

at the same
folder<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.319> save<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.069> project<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
folder that you save the project that

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.370 
folder that you save the project that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
example here I'm making the new identity

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.660 
example here I'm making the new identity
for<00:02:25.709> project<00:02:26.709> for<00:02:26.860> d<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:30.160> know<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> always

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
for project for d and you know I always

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.300 
for project for d and you know I always
start<00:02:31.180> with<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.660> new<00:02:31.870> folder<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.190> know

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
start with a new folder and you know

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.360 
start with a new folder and you know
have<00:02:33.790> inside<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.690> folder<00:02:34.900> c4d<00:02:35.590> files<00:02:36.010> after

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
have inside that folder c4d files after

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.090 
have inside that folder c4d files after
fact<00:02:36.760> files<00:02:37.080> signal<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.260> symbol<00:02:38.830> for<00:02:38.860> d

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
fact files signal for the symbol for d

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.210 
fact files signal for the symbol for d
render<00:02:39.489> after<00:02:40.030> fact<00:02:40.330> render<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.069> sound<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
render after fact render and sound the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.670 
render after fact render and sound the
fact-check<00:02:43.120> texture<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.930> i<00:02:44.020> use<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.260> this

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
fact-check texture that i use for this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.190 
fact-check texture that i use for this
project<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.330> very<00:02:46.450> important<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.050> know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
project so it's very important you know

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.100 
project so it's very important you know
to<00:02:47.230> have<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:48.100> folder<00:02:48.880> for<00:02:49.060> every<00:02:49.360> project<00:02:49.630> just

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
to have a folder for every project just

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.960 
to have a folder for every project just
to<00:02:50.170> keep<00:02:50.350> things<00:02:50.410> organized<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.790> don't

directly so we'll save to whatever you
know<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.760> save<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.840> first<00:03:02.050> time<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
know you save the first time now you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.479 
know you save the first time now you
have<00:03:03.850> other<00:03:04.060> option<00:03:04.570> user<00:03:05.380> directory<00:03:06.070> which

have other option user directory which

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.270 
have other option user directory which
is<00:03:06.989> will<00:03:07.989> go<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.760> know<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:11.280> think

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
keep it to project directory where I

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.860 
keep it to project directory where I
make<00:03:31.030> my<00:03:31.470> my<00:03:32.470> project<00:03:33.040> set<00:03:33.220> up<00:03:33.370> there<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.870> then

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
make my my project set up there and then

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.630 
make my my project set up there and then
we'll<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.410> save<00:03:35.530> automatic<00:03:36.070> over<00:03:36.280> there<00:03:36.430> so
