week old dinosaur and his name is Cleo
and<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> latest<00:00:29.970> generation

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and this is really the latest generation

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.060 
and this is really the latest generation
of<00:00:30.570> robotic<00:00:30.840> pets<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.590> you've<00:00:31.740> heard<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of robotic pets you know you've heard of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.970 
of robotic pets you know you've heard of
I<00:00:32.250> Bo<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.030> robot<00:00:33.360> dog<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
I Bo was the robot dog this is really a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.139 
I Bo was the robot dog this is really a
whole<00:00:35.160> new<00:00:35.190> generation<00:00:35.460> which<00:00:35.940> would

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
whole new generation which would

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.060 
whole new generation which would
interact<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.050> got<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> camera<00:00:37.860> it's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
interact with you it's got a camera it's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.549 
interact with you it's got a camera it's
got<00:00:38.190> ears<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.270> sensors<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
got ears it's got sensors so when I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.229 
got ears it's got sensors so when I
stroke<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.160> his<00:00:41.340> head<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:42.030> likes

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
stroke it on his head it really likes

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
stroke it on his head it really likes
that<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.829> interacts<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> world

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that it really interacts with the world

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670 
that it really interacts with the world
so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> first<00:00:46.050> generation

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so this is really the first generation

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
so this is really the first generation
of<00:00:46.739> robotic<00:00:47.070> pets<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.910> engage<00:00:48.629> with

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of robotic pets that we can engage with

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
of robotic pets that we can engage with
and<00:00:49.350> bond<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.309> find<00:00:51.059> quite

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and bond with and actually find quite

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.479 
and bond with and actually find quite
cute<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.020> eventually<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.100> part<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> our

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
cute and eventually have as part of our

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
cute and eventually have as part of our
families<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.809> people<00:00:54.989> are

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
families what do you think people are

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.510 
families what do you think people are
seriously<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.770> give<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.039> their<00:00:56.190> dogs<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
seriously gonna give up their dogs and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
seriously gonna give up their dogs and
their<00:00:56.640> cats<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.539> robot<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.500> everybody

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
their cats for a robot know everybody

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
their cats for a robot know everybody
will<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.460> people<00:00:59.760> will<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> mean<00:01:00.239> for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
will but some people will I mean for

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.049 
will but some people will I mean for
example<00:01:00.539> those<00:01:00.989> people<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.440> allergies

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
example those people that have allergies

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
example those people that have allergies
you<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> real<00:01:03.899> problem

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you know that's that's a real problem

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
you know that's that's a real problem
for<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.210> convenience<00:01:07.080> issues

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
for them or just the convenience issues

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.100 
for them or just the convenience issues
that's<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.240> example<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.080> know

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that's right and so for example you know

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
that's right and so for example you know
if<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:10.409> traveling<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.790> heading<00:01:12.390> off

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
if you're traveling I'm just heading off

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990 
if you're traveling I'm just heading off
on<00:01:12.510> our<00:01:12.659> around<00:01:13.320> world<00:01:13.590> speaking<00:01:14.189> tour<00:01:14.400> with

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
on our around world speaking tour with

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.050 
on our around world speaking tour with
family<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.979> switch<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> pet<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
family I can just switch off the pet and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
family I can just switch off the pet and
we<00:01:18.570> don't<00:01:18.750> need<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> worry<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.170> getting<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
we don't need to worry about getting a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.440 
we don't need to worry about getting a
kennel<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.310> something<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.759> annoy<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.299> big

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
kennel or something well annoy the big

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
kennel or something well annoy the big
thing<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> people<00:01:22.229> love<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
thing is that people love that the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.609 
thing is that people love that the
response<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.600> pets<00:01:25.110> absolute

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
response they get from pets absolute

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.260 
response they get from pets absolute
love<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> they<00:01:26.159> showed<00:01:26.460> back<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:26.970> saying

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
love that they showed back you're saying

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.060 
love that they showed back you're saying
that<00:01:27.450> robotics<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> such<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> point

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that robotics getting to such a point

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
that robotics getting to such a point
now<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.240> give<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> same<00:01:30.869> feelings<00:01:31.619> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
now that they give the same feelings of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.920 
now that they give the same feelings of
love<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.549> quite<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.810> this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
love not quite the same this is but this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.749 
love not quite the same this is but this
is<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> first<00:01:34.439> generation<00:01:34.650> where<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.460> really

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
is the first generation where we really

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
is the first generation where we really
can<00:01:35.790> form<00:01:36.360> emotional<00:01:36.840> bonds<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.350> robots

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
can form emotional bonds with robots

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
can form emotional bonds with robots
there's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> futurist<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.090> think<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
there's a futurist I think one of the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.960 
there's a futurist I think one of the
things<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> most<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.970> the

people and what we are finding is that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
people and what we are finding is that
relationship<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.619> emotional<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.850> you

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
the software which makes it far more

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.920 
the software which makes it far more
lifelike<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.000> what<00:03:08.209> they're<00:03:08.360> doing<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.750> going

lifelike and what they're doing is going

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080 
lifelike and what they're doing is going
to<00:03:09.560> open<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> out<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.580> anybody<00:03:10.820> can

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to open that out so that anybody can

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.060 
to open that out so that anybody can
develop<00:03:11.570> their<00:03:11.720> own<00:03:11.870> behavior<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:12.950> for

develop their own behavior so for

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.789 
develop their own behavior so for
example<00:03:13.340> they<00:03:13.400> had<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> Valentine<00:03:14.560> update<00:03:15.560> for

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
example they had a Valentine update for

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.020 
example they had a Valentine update for
it<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.040> they<00:03:16.220> had<00:03:16.400> particularly<00:03:16.640> loving

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
it so they had particularly loving

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.180 
it so they had particularly loving
behaviors<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.470> will<00:03:18.680> continue<00:03:18.830> to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
behaviors and so will continue to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.039 
behaviors and so will continue to
advance<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.730> not<00:03:19.850> just<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.150> stack<00:03:20.570> machine<00:03:20.930> it

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049
