stand<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:10.670> think<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> black<00:03:11.210> and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.880 
stand out and I think the black and
white<00:03:11.540> color<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.080> give<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.290> shoe<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> really

white color and give the shoe a really
clean<00:03:13.250> look<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.470> finally<00:03:21.470> there<00:03:21.740> was<00:03:21.830> one
