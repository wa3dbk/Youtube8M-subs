 1 some some interesting aspects 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.719
 first 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.719
 you will have the possibility together with the publisher 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 said request 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 assalto reviews 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.639
 saw that it would self-evaluate self-evaluation 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.069
 is for each network unit 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.339
 2 of each book 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.740
 you have the possibility is making the current variation with your 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.640
 students 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.820
 and cites can do whatever wants RV and will also evaluate the possibility of these 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.920
 students 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 the injured content 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.790
 Ana 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.760
 another interesting question 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.740
 it is not, however, mythologized ' 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.770
 educated 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.960
 you have 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.550
 there it is 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.950
 together with the publisher also provided a bank of issues this bank 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.140
 of questions are worked out questions 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.220
 the vestibular consecrated in Brazil ii is a way to deepen the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.480
 knowledge and already preparing the student 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.390
 for a possible titular tevez in the high school year 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.050
 what is to come 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.850
 It's late and you know that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.390
 I actually 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.210
 the accused was the sides are changing in brazil 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.850
 and we need to adjust 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.750
 to this new reality 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.710
 and with respect 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.910
 au textbook 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.540
 the great differential of this textbook 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.580
 contextualized history is that it was formulated 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.950
 the people who really 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.500
 Lucas was the fado save. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.509
 He is fernando menezes 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.740
 Is that the tone as teachers? 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.230
 henrique this is this experience she was extremely important 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.450
 because we got there 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 is to put on paper 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.489
 what would be important and what could really be discarded 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.189
 within a classroom context for this really experience then 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.079
 history and contextualized and differs from others 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.249
 because, in fact, it is done by teachers who actually work in the 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.589
 Marketplace 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.120
 he this book contextualized history 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.420
 is it has anything like a body of information 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.319
 it's the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.949
 situations that illustrate well to have a reflection on the reality 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.430
 not only from Brazil but from the world this reality she is she is a reality 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.539
 which can be taken to the student 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.200
 because because actually 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.550
 we have the idea that the student is distant from what would be the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.060
 knowledge is more scientific through 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.299
 side of the story book contextualized you can 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.549
 in the subject approach that student of the historical flavor 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 Why are issues of action? 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.419
 questions 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.889
 contemporary 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.459
 Another important thing of the contextualised history book is that in each 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.019
 chapter 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.179
 to discuss 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:31.309
 to discuss are updated questions are texts that take the student to the 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:32.289
 reflection 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.129
 he 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.809
 Within these texts there is the idea questions in answers that can be 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.469
 worked with the 'teacher' 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.299
 It's with the trick ysa is important here 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.870
 it is clear that graphic design 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.870
 the question of maps in the inter follows in three dimensions 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.530
 and you have the possibility of working there 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.620
 possibility of working with population displacements 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.620
 this asked 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.179
 that is told in the contextualized estoril is a story 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.749
 is very close to 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.490
 see still owner of the reality of the student 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.280
 that is 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.459
 and he realizes that these words are not far from his reality by 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.479
 What is our concern? 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.550
 I did not tell him to do a book. 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.919
 henrique the student lise and it is understood that it was written 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.650
 because 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.430
 the big problem sometimes 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.950
 What is positive about history? 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.099
 they bring 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.710
 we are extremely 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.910
 complicated for a student eg 6th grade a 7th grade student 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.009
 these terms are often not understood 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.370
 our concern was to do 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.229
 The stage 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.840
 it is accurate and really loose but little is in not forgetting that this client 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.199
 Souto has to try and is arrested. 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.389
 to a reality 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.409
 it is historical 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.509
 and economically based 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.509
 so that was the concern 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.920
 in trying to show the student what story can be fun 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.770
 story does not have to be something heavy 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.190
 helena true 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.190
 he asked him for the toucan book efe 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.150
 Pull today, I have to study history. 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.509
 he read 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
 realize that the next chapter will be better than the previous one. 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.930
 This was my concern of ferdinando in him is to go get 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.860
 it is with a type of literature a type of writing 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.500
 closer to reality 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.330
 and I think the term context story 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.280
 he has a lot to do 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.569
 also with this question of writing and how it was written 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.449
 and how to present it 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:53.750
 if you catch 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.490
 and look at the graphic design or ally for example 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.050
 I'll write it down 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.819
 to ease into dudu trains 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.730
 from the book 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.389
 it's action illustrations 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.580
 that are understandable are easy to understand 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.969
 and misses you so much 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.430
 you wanted that my students were changed they noriaki 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.979
 look for the test started aa 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.440
 there i space was teacher is to be for that his moon the book history 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.969
 contextualized and after newman the target professed 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.389
 technical issues that are issues that can be worked out 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:32.900
 with the students 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.749
 also with a bank of questions and to separate 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.080
 This question bank is more about this self-assessment 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.450
 one can reach the student if requested by the 'teacher' 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.750
 in order to because 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.620
 Because I want 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.479
 The Bolivian Context Story 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.830
 it will reach the student with 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.660
 err 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.080
 it's paradise 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.580
 at the time of the series he will have there his for coconut life and the teacher 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.800
 full he will be able to work 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.680
 a little with good parachute 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.060
 I hope you enjoy not only the teachers 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.830
 it hurts students enjoy the goal 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.040
 The Contextualized History Book 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.310
 It was a very carefully made book. 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.909
 It's not a book made with 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:18.009
 with much concern with another book was written written 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.389
 or with salvadorian fate to fernando menezes but if it was written to 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:24.009
 you 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.409
 Why are you there? 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.539
 pleasure to read epp understand the story 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.649
 in the survey is not a seven-product bug seven heads story 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.360
 is that it is a matter like any other 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.719
 and requires discipline 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:40.909
 it does not require concern with what is happening in your daily life 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:44.389
 is that history 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:46.259
 is life 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:48.799
 so it's important that we notice here
