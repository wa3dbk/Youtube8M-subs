00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
also included in the box which i think

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.720 
also included in the box which i think
is<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.739> important<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.249> otherwise

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
is really important because otherwise

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
is really important because otherwise
that<00:00:59.850> provides<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.539> twenty<00:01:00.899> dollars<00:01:01.230> at

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that provides like twenty dollars at

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.280 
that provides like twenty dollars at
walmart<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.800> something<00:01:02.039> other<00:01:02.730> than<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
walmart or something other than that the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.749 
walmart or something other than that the
console<00:01:04.649> is<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> same<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
console is basically the same as the

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.840 
console is basically the same as the
previous<00:01:06.299> models<00:01:06.899> it<00:01:07.649> still<00:01:08.220> has<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> large

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
previous models it still has the large

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
previous models it still has the large
power<00:01:09.299> adapter<00:01:09.840> brick<00:01:10.079> and<00:01:10.640> Microsoft

power adapter brick and Microsoft

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450
