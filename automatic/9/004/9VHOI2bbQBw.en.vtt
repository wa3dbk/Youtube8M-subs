00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.080
 hoist to salvation everyone 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 and black bean hi black greets so 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.620
 for those who care about our channel 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.040
 you see the recap of the houses 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.010
 traps 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 if you do not understand episode 1 it's 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.570
 well what if you do not like me sorry 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.000
 will stop cutting you it's 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.339
 simply that the houses of the traps in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
 that were carried out on the chain 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.879
 our participants who is the joke 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.149
 dream only blake has already said hello 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.350
 no but it does not matter simply 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.360
 because as he does it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.190
 that's his point of view and so if it's 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.050
 we filming them look what makes 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.640
 from behind it's not very interesting 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.530
 it's better to let him do it so 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.550
 you did not see what happened I 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.990
 advise you to pause 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.910
 directly to go see on his channel 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.860
 now the link of the video in his 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.840
 description and its chain too if you 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.539
 want to know more about this this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 strange character who does and who is 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.110
 really very nice who who is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.369
 frankly someone super who does 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 good content where I recommend it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.000
 obviously it's normal nothing done 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.520
 the same for us anyway so that's 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 really disgusting and doing nothing 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.740
 so what do you continue to watch 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 this video is that I imagine you 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.039
 have seen the house of traps and where he 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 is dead you saw that blake has passed 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.819
 the green room without much problem 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.289
 even if he was going up so what iran 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.069
 what it is that this thing is all good 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.259
 it's not a big deal 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.580
 the gray room he completely manage it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.660
 by putting on the gray block for 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.490
 activate the lever what is 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.860
 I had not thought it was totally a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.750
 good idea below who has yes thank you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.099
 sookie the series measure to him sorry he 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.690
 did not come to the room guy i had 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.950
 little bugs ah yes ok no but 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.039
 he managed very well and you'll see that on 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.330
 the video the purple room 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.819
 there was a block of land in sections 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.770
 excuses by the way thank you and so you have 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.840
 jump to it's pretty good 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.040
 do not jump in the middle that's it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.660
 the worst she makes you jump in the middle 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.530
 you can not go before I've had enough 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.520
 Fear indeed the sun and then I 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.520
 am lying on my seat 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.150

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.800
 only brown beta passed then the only 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.870

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.720
 with lewis leinster to arrow during the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.740
 jam beautiful there we tried it was not 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.480
 badly we only put one arrow 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.160
 you also have to manage the jump is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.570
 however not very easy from the first 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.890
 times you have two mistakes but 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.480

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.500
