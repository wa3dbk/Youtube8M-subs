00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 the staff is fine, I'm going to give a tip 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.040
 for you how to turn a box 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.269
 to lose you in a beautiful cut 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.269
 make up 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 just learn how to do well with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.179
 he 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.189
 We're going to need a wound box. 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:24.510
 The Shea A Park Hinges Super Bonder 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.760
 acetone year this milk pen in a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.000
 lighter 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.550
 to start we'll unpack the box 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.790
 taking this if paper that is in 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790
 return 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:02.800
 to help remove the adhesive we 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.390
 use affected then just play a 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:12.820
 little return on top let them act 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 for a few seconds and which read 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 cloth scrub 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.330
 now you're taking off as you want 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:33.450
 company or with a fingernail with a cloth 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:33.450
 now I just cleaned the area got clean 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 now we'll mark the two sides 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:51.569
 from the box the way I did he looks 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.569
 just the corner from both sides 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.470
 now heating the stylus to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.250
 easy to break and cyclic looks good 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.250
 easier 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.270
 now we're going to take all this part 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.270
 left behind 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.560
 Let's cut this whole piece with 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.310
 stylus still warm 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.790
 we even repeat process until braille 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.790
 every day 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.770
 now just remove those agencies that 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.770
 may have stayed 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.760
 and was leasing 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.190
 the next step will be to glue the hinges 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.910
 in that part that we were going to die with 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.110
 stiletto and with the aid of glue 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.850
 We're going to go through all this and only 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.850
 taking care not to stay in the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.980
 the middle one 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:40.290
 now it's just coar holding movie well 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.920
 because otherwise you can be slipping from 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.920
 one side to the other 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.830
 we do both sides 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.150
 and it was neither as mobile as you can 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.150
 to see 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.680
 the next step is heart now shot 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.079
 your creativity and do what you want 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.079
 I put my name on it. 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.120
 and stayed like this 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.819
 now you have a box 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.009
 acrylic for storing your socks 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.110
