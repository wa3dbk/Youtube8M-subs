*sigh* I can't believe Marisa caught a cold

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.350
I don't really want to go get medicine for her, but if she asks me like that...

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.710
You're the only one I can ask something like this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.980
Oh my god~, so embarrassing~

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010
Damn it, where did she go!?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.680
What's the matter?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.050
Oh, Alice-san

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510
Welcome

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.110
I just had a thief get away

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.350
I didn't see who it was, but I'm guessing it was that black-and-white magician again

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.180
Marisa? She's nursing a cold at home

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.280
Really!?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.010
Sorry for suspecting her like that

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.180
No, it's understandable. I mean, it's Marisa

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.510
Yes, that's what I thought

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.550
Please wait here while I'll go get the medicine

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.280
There

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
Now that I think about it, I haven't been to Eientei since the incident

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.950
Huh?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.510
I didn't even notice her put out this tea. How nice of her

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.050
? There wasn't much tea in here...

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.650
Huh? Why was I sleepin--

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.950
What?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.580
What?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.580
Was this room this big?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.150
Did it get huge?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.850
Hey Oneesan, can I ask you something?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.680
Huh? Did she go home already?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.550
Man, I was gonna milk some cash

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.610
Th-Thanks. You're the--

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.750
Is this a dream? Or is it reality?

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.410
What?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.910
What's happening right now might be a dream

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.450
But it might be a dream you'll never wake up from

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.250
Are you trying to confuse me?

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.410
Are you trying to imitate the Cheshire Cat or something?

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.650
I'm not the Cheshire (chisha) Cat...

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.210
I'm the Underworld (chika) Cat*
[*A hand-drawn series by Puchi]

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.750
STOP
I'm the Underworld (chika) Cat*

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.350
You can't use the names of other people's series

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.410
Whaat? But I got permission

Underground Cat Trivia
[Voice: Chisha Cat is also called Chesha Cat. Actually, that's more like it.]
Although "Chesha" Cat is apparently closer to the actual pronunciation, Disney items often use "Chisha" Cat these days
Maybe "Chisha Cat" was easier to deal with commercially
[Satori: Remember that!!]

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.480
So, why are you here, too? And why are you also small?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.450
Did you also come to get medicine?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.080
Hm?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.610
I-I don't see why that matters

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.280
No, it can't not--

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.250
Hm?

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.680
I just had a thief get away

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.050
Wait, were you...stealing...?

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.150
No, I wasn't!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.310
I was just wondering if they had a morgue here. It's not that I was stealing--

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.680
You're totally a thief, you thieving cat

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.150
I guess I ran out of luck when I got thirsty and drank that tea

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.410
You're clearly stealing. What's with this flashback going on in the back?

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.210
Alice-saan, I brought the medicine

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.580
Huh? She's not here?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.250
Oh! Good timing!

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.510
Hey--

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.510
Hm?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.680
Must be my imagination

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.950
Hey! What was that for?

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.050
Well, I mean, I'm trespassing here

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.510
What do I care!? I'm calling for help!

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.910
I saved you earlier, didn't I?

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.510
!?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.480
Are you going to repay my kindness with ingratitude?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.810
I didn't know you were such an awful woman

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.710
Gununu...

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.380
Huh, did she go to the restroom?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.680
Oh no, there she goes...

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.780
I guess we have no choice but to find a solution on our own

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.410
This damn cat...!

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.080
There's probably medicine here

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.650
(We should definitely call for help...)

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.250
Oh! Maybe it's this!

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.910
Hey! You need to read the directions first!

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.480
"Enlarge"
It says "medicine that enlarges," so it's probably this

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.550
"Enlarge"

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.110
Kya!

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.150
Huh!?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.210
How is it?

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.780
I don't think I feel anything...

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.110
See? It wasn't this one. You have to check what kind of medicine it is before you take it...

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.450
Then what about this one?

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.610
Hey, what did you make me take!?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.380
"--" "Grow" "Enlarge"
Medicine for growing

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.750
"--" "Grow" "Enlarge"
Grow WHAT!?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.080
Huh?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.110
Did something grow?

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.880
No...

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.780
Hmm, it looks like they're all defective

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.180
"Multiply"
But there should be a medicine somewhere that gets us back to normal

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.910
"Multiply"
Then how about this one?

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.810
"Multiply"

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.780
"Multiply"
What was THAT one!?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.550
"Multiply" "Grow" "Enlarge"
Medicine for multiplying

"Multiply" "Grow" "Enlarge"
Multiply WHAT!?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.910
More!?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.750
Huh, nothing's happening

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.010
You think you can use me as a guinea pig...!?

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.750
Then you drink this!

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.410
Hup!

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.080
Hey! Don't dodge it!

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.410
Sorry, I won't do it again

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.550
We'll be even when you drink one!

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.280
Hup
Damn it, stop dodging it!

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.410
You two, why are you here?

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.080
What!? Oh, um! We seem to have drunk some weird medicine...!

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.210
Oh! Wait, did you drink that tea!?

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.050
I was going to make Udonge drink it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.310
But if you two became small, I guess the experiment was a success

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.480
Very good

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.980
It's not good at all!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.810
*sigh* Can we just get a medicine that gets us back to normal?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.510
Hmm, sure, but...

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.980
There's only one of Prototype Number 1

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.150
Which one of you is going to drink it?

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.780
It's my turn to take one, so me

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.980
Huh? H-Hey!

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.450
Now we're even ♪

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.050
Hold on! She's a thief--

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.810
Oh? Oh! My body's getting bigger!

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.110
Ahh! It's too late!

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.150
I'm finally back to normal!!

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.480
Huh!?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.210
Is the prototype a success?

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.810
No! Something's wrong!

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.610
Then you try Prototype Number 2

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.780
There was Number 2!?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.980
Oh, thank you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.150

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.350
Will she be all right?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.650
She's just unconscious. She should be fine if she keeps resting

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.150
Oh! She's awake!

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.180
Ow...oh! I'm back to normal!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.810
I'm glad, Alice-san

What!? Udonge-san!?

I really wish you wouldn't experiment on us

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.150
It's because of experiments that technology can advance

Oh, yes, it was this cat who--

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.710
Oneesan's a magician, so it's not surprising if she has a black cat as a servant, right?
