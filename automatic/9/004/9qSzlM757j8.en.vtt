00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
better position economically but the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.880 
better position economically but the
baneling<00:03:36.300> nest<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.600> finished<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.200> will<00:03:37.710> we

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
baneling nest is finished and will we

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.500 
baneling nest is finished and will we
see<00:03:38.070> some<00:03:38.340> baileys<00:03:38.790> being<00:03:39.000> morphed<00:03:39.330> I'm

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
see some baileys being morphed I'm

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.210 
see some baileys being morphed I'm
guessing<00:03:39.960> they<00:03:40.080> will<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:40.380> morphed<00:03:40.710> up<00:03:40.920> here<00:03:41.130> on

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
guessing they will be morphed up here on

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.220 
guessing they will be morphed up here on
the<00:03:41.280> high<00:03:41.400> ground<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.730> yeah<00:03:42.030> we've<00:03:42.660> got<00:03:42.870> five

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
the high ground and yeah we've got five

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.380 
the high ground and yeah we've got five
banelings<00:03:43.860> being<00:03:44.220> morphed<00:03:44.490> in<00:03:44.640> two<00:03:45.210> more

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
banelings being morphed in two more

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.420 
banelings being morphed in two more
zerglings<00:03:45.870> are<00:03:46.020> yes<00:03:46.440> transforming<00:03:47.280> or

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
zerglings are yes transforming or

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.940 
zerglings are yes transforming or
morphing<00:03:47.880> into<00:03:48.000> banelings<00:03:48.570> as<00:03:48.750> well<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.770> this

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
morphing into banelings as well so this

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.040 
morphing into banelings as well so this
could<00:03:50.160> be<00:03:50.220> very<00:03:50.310> very<00:03:50.760> troublesome<00:03:51.630> for

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
could be very very troublesome for

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.050 
could be very very troublesome for
dhamaka<00:03:52.440> if<00:03:52.650> he's<00:03:52.800> caught<00:03:53.010> off<00:03:53.220> guard<00:03:53.250> there

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
dhamaka if he's caught off guard there

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.790 
dhamaka if he's caught off guard there
are<00:03:54.240> two<00:03:54.480> spine<00:03:54.810> crawlers<00:03:55.170> coming<00:03:55.500> up<00:03:55.620> and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
are two spine crawlers coming up and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.620 
are two spine crawlers coming up and
there<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> queen<00:03:56.730> blocking<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.240> ramp<00:03:57.450> with

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
there is a queen blocking the ramp with

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.930 
there is a queen blocking the ramp with
six<00:03:57.990> circlings<00:03:58.350> here<00:03:58.620> one<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.610> out<00:03:59.790> to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
six circlings here one is going out to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.700 
six circlings here one is going out to
scout<00:04:00.210> now<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.720> he's<00:04:00.810> gonna<00:04:01.080> see<00:04:01.350> all<00:04:01.380> these

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
scout now and he's gonna see all these

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.520 
scout now and he's gonna see all these
banelings<00:04:02.280> gonna<00:04:02.490> get<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> few<00:04:02.880> food<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:04.350> is

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
banelings gonna get a few food that is

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.650 
banelings gonna get a few food that is
not<00:04:04.830> good<00:04:05.070> for<00:04:05.100> Omar<00:04:05.550> he<00:04:05.700> needs<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.180> watch<00:04:06.390> that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
not good for Omar he needs to watch that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.680 
not good for Omar he needs to watch that

baneling micro and to blow up on a queen
here

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
here

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.280 
here
that's<00:04:11.640> that's<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.879> bad<00:04:13.060> decision<00:04:13.569> split<00:04:14.170> up

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
that's that's a bad decision split up

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.129 
that's that's a bad decision split up
two<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.810> banelings<00:04:16.810> I'm<00:04:16.900> going<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.079> go

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
two of the banelings I'm going to go

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.720 
two of the banelings I'm going to go
back<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.980> see<00:04:18.130> what<00:04:18.280> he<00:04:18.340> did<00:04:18.489> wrong

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
back to that just see what he did wrong

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.260 
back to that just see what he did wrong
and<00:04:18.970> microwave<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:20.250> slow<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.430> down<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:21.940> blue

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
and microwave and slow that down so blue

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.450 
and microwave and slow that down so blue
one<00:04:22.510> bailing<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.199> Queen's<00:04:23.500> one<00:04:24.250> got

one bailing on the Queen's one got

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.159 
one bailing on the Queen's one got
killed<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.060> then<00:04:25.210> two<00:04:25.540> on<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.900> spine

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
killed and then two on the spine

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.560 
killed and then two on the spine
crawlers<00:04:26.560> each<00:04:26.919> that<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.760> not<00:04:28.090> what<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.330> want

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
crawlers each that is not what you want

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.750 
crawlers each that is not what you want
to<00:04:28.630> do<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:29.710> don't<00:04:29.919> want<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.130> attack<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.580> these

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
to do you don't want to attack you these

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.159 
to do you don't want to attack you these
spine<00:04:31.000> crawlers<00:04:31.330> with<00:04:31.510> your<00:04:31.660> banelings<00:04:32.020> that

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
spine crawlers with your banelings that

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.290 
spine crawlers with your banelings that
is<00:04:32.290> virtually<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.770> throwing<00:04:33.460> away<00:04:33.729> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
is virtually a throwing away the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.620 
is virtually a throwing away the
minerals<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.960> gas<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.740> supply<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:37.419> want

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
minerals and gas and the supply you want

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.939 
minerals and gas and the supply you want
to<00:04:37.720> use<00:04:37.840> them<00:04:38.050> on<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.440> banelings<00:04:38.800> on

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
to use them on the banelings on

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.280 
to use them on the banelings on
zerglings<00:04:39.430> or<00:04:39.639> drones<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.360> guess<00:04:40.870> he<00:04:40.990> couldn't

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
zerglings or drones I guess he couldn't

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.840 
zerglings or drones I guess he couldn't
get<00:04:41.440> up<00:04:41.560> into<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.919> main<00:04:42.070> base<00:04:42.310> he<00:04:42.520> probably

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
get up into the main base he probably

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
get up into the main base he probably
should<00:04:43.120> have<00:04:43.180> just<00:04:43.330> taken<00:04:43.450> out<00:04:43.660> as<00:04:43.780> many

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
should have just taken out as many

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.900 
should have just taken out as many
zerglings<00:04:44.380> as<00:04:44.470> he<00:04:44.560> can<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.979> then<00:04:45.040> retreated

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
zerglings as he can and then retreated

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.240 
zerglings as he can and then retreated
with<00:04:46.180> those<00:04:46.419> banelings<00:04:46.950> because<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.070> gains

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
with those banelings because the gains

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.590 
with those banelings because the gains
of<00:04:48.400> spraying<00:04:48.669> caught<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.060> spine<00:04:49.240> crawlers

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
of spraying caught the spine crawlers

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600 
of spraying caught the spine crawlers
they're<00:04:49.810> just<00:04:50.020> absolutely<00:04:50.200> worthless<00:04:50.889> it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
they're just absolutely worthless it

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.050 
they're just absolutely worthless it
takes<00:04:52.290> five<00:04:53.290> or<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:53.889> banelings<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.550> kill<00:04:54.820> this

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
takes five or so banelings to kill this

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.330 
takes five or so banelings to kill this
one<00:04:55.690> spine<00:04:56.110> crawler<00:04:56.410> but<00:04:56.680> one<00:04:56.830> spine<00:04:57.070> crawler

one spine crawler but one spine crawler
only<00:04:57.550> costs<00:04:57.880> 150<00:04:58.540> minerals<00:04:58.870> so<00:04:59.139> that<00:04:59.800> is<00:04:59.950> not

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
only costs 150 minerals so that is not

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.310 
only costs 150 minerals so that is not

second Queen so his larvae production is

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.860 
second Queen so his larvae production is
going<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:53.770> be<00:06:53.860> okay<00:06:53.950> and<00:06:54.420> he's<00:06:55.420> putting<00:06:55.750> up

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
going to be okay and he's putting up

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.720 
going to be okay and he's putting up
well<00:06:56.110> that's<00:06:56.260> only<00:06:56.380> his<00:06:56.530> second<00:06:56.980> extractor<00:06:57.490> so

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
well that's only his second extractor so

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.680 
well that's only his second extractor so
I<00:06:57.760> would<00:06:58.090> have<00:06:58.180> thought<00:06:58.270> that<00:06:58.330> was<00:06:58.510> in<00:06:58.630> the

I would have thought that was in the

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.600 
I would have thought that was in the
main<00:06:58.840> base<00:06:59.080> but<00:06:59.830> splitting<00:07:00.130> up<00:07:00.310> his<00:07:00.430> gas

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610
