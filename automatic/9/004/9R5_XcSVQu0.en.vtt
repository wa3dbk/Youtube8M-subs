back<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.360> zero<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.990> then<00:02:33.170> you'd<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.590> do

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
back to zero and then you'd have to do

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.710 
back to zero and then you'd have to do
it<00:02:34.280> all<00:02:34.400> again<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.970> try<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:35.540> back<00:02:35.690> up
