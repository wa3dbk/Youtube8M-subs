00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
find room for the the force but I really

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.569 
find room for the the force but I really
like<00:03:38.040> my<00:03:38.190> tech<00:03:38.699> card<00:03:39.000> too<00:03:39.239> much<00:03:39.769> so<00:03:40.769> Bedivere

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
like my tech card too much so Bedivere

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.280 
like my tech card too much so Bedivere
is<00:03:42.060> at<00:03:42.299> three<00:03:42.480> at<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.599> moment<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.019> three<00:03:43.199> is

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
is at three at the moment like three is

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.449 
is at three at the moment like three is
a<00:03:43.319> good<00:03:43.379> number<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:43.799> palomitas<00:03:44.430> I

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
a good number because palomitas I

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.740 
a good number because palomitas I
normally<00:03:44.910> try<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.150> protect<00:03:45.359> anyway<00:03:45.690> so

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
normally try and protect anyway so

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.509 
normally try and protect anyway so
sometimes<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.349> benefits<00:03:46.769> are<00:03:46.889> kind<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.370> dead

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
sometimes the benefits are kind of dead

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.949 
sometimes the benefits are kind of dead
but<00:03:48.919> stupid<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:51.180> 12<00:03:51.569> case<00:03:51.810> that

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
but stupid it is to have 12 case that

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.420 
but stupid it is to have 12 case that
you<00:03:52.019> can<00:03:52.139> just<00:03:52.199> call<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.650> really<00:03:53.040> great<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
you can just call is really great and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.069 
you can just call is really great and
then<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.090> last<00:03:54.239> tech<00:03:54.540> card<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.900> play<00:03:55.019> for

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
then the last tech card that I play for

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.800 
then the last tech card that I play for
the<00:03:55.199> tues<00:03:55.409> is<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:56.030> high<00:03:57.030> dog<00:03:57.209> breeder<00:03:57.449> a<00:03:57.540> car<00:03:57.780> a

the tues is a high dog breeder a car a

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.020 
the tues is a high dog breeder a car a
