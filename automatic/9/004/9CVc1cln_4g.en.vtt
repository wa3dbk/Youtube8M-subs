00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.139
 protective layer my contact with the environment at the same time 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.219
 that harm or 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.059
 He is afraid 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.059
 is one of the many issues that interest scientists 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.330
 It is important that the creams are well tolerated because the one that employ 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
 cosmetics has to be able to trust 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.550
 is addressed this moment was experienced in the skin of animals cause them to 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.979
 suffering and also failed to prevent new products from being launched on the market 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.520
 that cause allergies because the immune system of the animals reacts 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.460
 differently from the people in valencia 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.700
 American companies 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.230
 the experiments with human skin samples replaced the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260
 experimentation with animals 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.390
 the scientists developed and built an automated factory 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.230
 of skin 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.680
 for the first time and isolate the cells from a tiny portion 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 standing 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 in the incubator they reproduce 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.370
 the machine ensures that the cells receive their special diet 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.380
 two types of cells will eventually merge and grow together forming 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 a sample of two layers of skin 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.240
 will be appreciated in josÃ© zafra a good simple but it works just like 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.410
 in people 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.050
 if two people live together they often fight over issues related to the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.740
 coexistence the same happens with cells 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 each cell has a certain rights over the culture medium 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 each type of cell has to establish certain limitations already 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.090
 is also the needs of NATO 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.140
 so far it has not returned as 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.150
 the experts offer a piece of achievement with jelly-textured skin pieces 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.570
 present the same physiological characteristics 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.170
 that human skin 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.240
 so the chemicals the medicines and the creams can 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 prove better than animal trials 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.439
 under the microscope you can see that the skin's pinkish surface 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.799
 artificially produced is attacked by the cream applying the skin sample 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.799
 is damaged 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.099
 also the sun can be harmful to the skin 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.549
 low and that you're 'worried about people sunbathing at noon 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 next to the ap 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:47.229
 jonathan you feel bad when you see that people act are of the 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:52.159
 sun especially if one knows what this energy they subject to the skin with 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.929
 Sun rays can cause healthy cells to mutate into Catalan 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.879
 before scoring 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.120
 Scientists can already monitor the development of skin cancer 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.509
 in artificial human skin 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:10.229
 they experiment with the dangerous black skin cancer 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:15.269
 among other things to discover what makes it so aggressive and how can you 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.909
 reduce its effects 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.379
 under the microscope the black cancer cells are easily 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.469
 identifiable 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.829
 to be able to investigate even more accurately the development of cancer 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.300
 skin 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.360
 and being able to try new therapies you have to expand the skin sample 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.279
 for this they are introduced in a so-called biological reactor skin cells 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:43.719
 human on a structure of pig gut with blood vessels so that 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.089
 human skin develops 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:50.549
 so they could in the future perform transplants whore years from 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.249
 cells of the patients themselves there would be no rejection reactions 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.149
 We place these human cells on top of them and they begin to decompose the 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:05.379
 intestine of the pig in our biological reactor in the cases of implants 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.420
 there is still a lot of pork gut 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.380
 but after six months all the implant contains only material 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.169
 body the pig intestine which then completely decomposed and 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.440
 everything is simply human, that's why there is no risk of rejection. 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.000
 down in them a solution is offered for the big burns there were other 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.240
 injuries for example 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.800
 those derived from a cancer operation 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.870
 from a few healthy skin cells 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.210
 of a patient artificial skin could be generated 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.689
 very easily in the special factory 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.819
 one in that joust as a medical fan 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.219
 Regarding if I imagine that I had large injuries from burns or 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.489
 similar and I know I have to endure only three weeks to get a 

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:57.460
 piece of my own skin I do not find art 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.820
 to the horford but a positive perspective a neighbor of the area 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.990
 for the researchers to repair the skin as if by magic that only a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.770
 mobile phone internet 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.470
 love
