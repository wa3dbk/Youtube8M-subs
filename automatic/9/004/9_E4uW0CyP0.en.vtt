00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:26.369 
pocket or anything inside the back as
you<00:03:17.829> can<00:03:17.950> see<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:22.269> exterior<00:03:24.989> there<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.349> a

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379

even<00:03:38.829> though<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.099> detachable<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:40.120> believe

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
even though it's detachable I believe

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.649

there<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.439> no<00:03:41.739> choice<00:03:42.129> not<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.579> use<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.209> handle

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
there is no choice not to use the handle

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:52.589 
there is no choice not to use the handle
so<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:45.489> always<00:03:46.209> need<00:03:46.629> to<00:03:46.870> use<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.290> trap<00:03:51.599> from
