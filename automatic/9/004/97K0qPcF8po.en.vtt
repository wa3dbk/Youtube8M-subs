00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
had to do it so overall is 902 he's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.850 
had to do it so overall is 902 he's
health<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:12.260> 4809<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> his<00:01:13.619> attack<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:15.860> 347

health is 4809 and his attack is 347
which<00:01:17.610> ain't<00:01:17.909> great<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.040> he's<00:01:20.040> defense<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
which ain't great but he's defense I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.070 
which ain't great but he's defense I
don't<00:01:21.330> understand<00:01:21.600> why<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.840> should<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
don't understand why they should have a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
don't understand why they should have a
defender<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.920> well<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.130> anyway<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
defender on there as well but anyway so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.399 
defender on there as well but anyway so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
another reason why so make my decision

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.590 
another reason why so make my decision
so<00:02:33.490> because<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.760> was<00:02:34.000> going<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.240> go<00:02:34.360> for

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
so because I was going to go for

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.080 
so because I was going to go for
star-lord<00:02:35.140> because<00:02:35.800> because<00:02:36.370> he's<00:02:36.580> awakened

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
star-lord because because he's awakened

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
star-lord because because he's awakened
that's<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.690> reason<00:02:37.930> why<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.050> wasn't<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:38.470> for

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
that's the reason why I wasn't going for
