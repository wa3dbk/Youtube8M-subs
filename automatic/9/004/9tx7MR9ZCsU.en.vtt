a lot of misconception about when you

should repack your silencer as a rule of
thumb<00:00:14.219> twenty<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> thirty<00:00:15.089> hours<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.540> probably

everything your service intervals
probably<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> little<00:00:27.689> bit<00:00:27.869> shorter<00:00:28.199> than

about 20 hours on it so far alright
let's<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.059> into<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.450> get<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.660> thing

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
let's get into it and get this thing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260 
let's get into it and get this thing
about<00:00:37.079> basic<00:00:38.010> tools<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.370> may<00:00:38.520> need<00:00:38.730> advice

about basic tools you may need advice

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.700 
about basic tools you may need advice
that<00:00:39.480> ones<00:00:39.629> comes<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.020> handy<00:00:40.200> preferably

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that ones comes in handy preferably

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
loose and soft doors on it so you can

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.490 
loose and soft doors on it so you can
get<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> bracket<00:00:42.629> clamped<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.110> nice<00:00:43.290> and

get that bracket clamped in nice and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.049 
get that bracket clamped in nice and
tight<00:00:43.530> you'll<00:00:44.040> generally<00:00:44.340> want<00:00:44.460> rubber

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
tight you'll generally want rubber

tight you'll generally want rubber
mallet<00:00:45.450> some<00:00:45.989> silencers<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:46.950> put

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
mallet some silencers are actually put

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
mallet some silencers are actually put
together<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.550> hex<00:00:47.760> head<00:00:47.910> bolts<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.510> some

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
together with hex head bolts and some

together with hex head bolts and some
silencers<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.500> put<00:00:49.649> together<00:00:49.770> with

silencers are actually put together with

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
silencers are actually put together with
rivets<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.460> well<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.969> obviously<00:00:51.660> we'll<00:00:51.750> need<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
rivets as well so obviously we'll need a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
rivets as well so obviously we'll need a
drill<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.829> rivets<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> put<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.520> back

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
drill and some rivets to put it back

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430 
drill and some rivets to put it back
together<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.270> riveted<00:00:54.600> type<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.199> it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
together if it's a riveted type if it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.319 
together if it's a riveted type if it's
a<00:00:55.590> screwin<00:00:55.949> type<00:00:56.129> generally<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> allen

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a screwin type generally there a allen

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
a screwin type generally there a allen
head<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.840> threads<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> mount<00:00:58.440> very<00:00:58.590> deep<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
head the threads on a mount very deep so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.830 
head the threads on a mount very deep so
you<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.460> good<00:00:59.730> tools<00:01:00.000> otherwise<00:01:00.600> you'd<00:01:00.809> be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you want good tools otherwise you'd be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.090 
you want good tools otherwise you'd be
stripping<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> mount<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.620> we've<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.920> done

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
stripping the mount which we've all done

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
stripping the mount which we've all done
before<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.300> any<00:01:03.539> science<00:01:03.989> what

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
before with just about any science what

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.299 
before with just about any science what
you'll<00:01:04.260> find<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> you'll<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:05.070> start

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you'll find is you'll actually start

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
you'll find is you'll actually start
pulling<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> apart<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> front<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
pulling it apart from the front of the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
pulling it apart from the front of the
science<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> not<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> rear<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.820> you'll<00:01:09.030> be

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
science and not the rear so you'll be

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.550 
science and not the rear so you'll be
basically<00:01:09.689> working<00:01:09.900> from<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> mid

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
basically working from where the mid

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
basically working from where the mid
pipe<00:01:10.770> slides<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> silencer<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.270> we

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
pipe slides into the silencer so what we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.850 
pipe slides into the silencer so what we
do<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.900> these<00:01:13.049> bolts<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> then

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
do we get all these bolts out and then

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
do we get all these bolts out and then
what<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.580> need<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.939> maneuver<00:01:15.180> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
what we do is we need to maneuver it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.810 
what we do is we need to maneuver it
apart<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.020> sometimes<00:01:16.680> you'll<00:01:17.250> need<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> mallet

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
apart so sometimes you'll need a mallet

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.050 
apart so sometimes you'll need a mallet
sometimes<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> want

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.249 

okay<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.119> now<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:23.479> get<00:01:23.659> we'll<00:01:23.899> get<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.109> old

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
okay so now we get we'll get the old

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.499 
okay so now we get we'll get the old
packing<00:01:24.679> off<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.280> just<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.579> Stanley<00:01:25.939> knife<00:01:25.969> down

obviously<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:29.119> need<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.299> check<00:01:29.719> out<00:01:29.869> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
obviously we need to check out the

inside of it just make sure that the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.219 
inside of it just make sure that the
internals<00:01:31.819> are<00:01:31.939> still<00:01:32.119> okay<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.960> what<00:01:33.109> you'll

make<00:01:36.530> sure<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.859> core<00:01:37.159> still<00:01:37.460> in<00:01:37.549> great

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
make sure that that core still in great

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.669 
make sure that that core still in great
Nick<00:01:38.030> okay<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:38.659> now<00:01:38.929> we've<00:01:39.079> got<00:01:39.200> our<00:01:39.319> packing

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
that we're going to wrap around the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.249 
that we're going to wrap around the
silencer<00:01:41.149> it's<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.450> its<00:01:41.569> own<00:01:41.719> little<00:01:41.899> bag<00:01:42.229> so

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
silencer it's in its own little bag so

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.749 
silencer it's in its own little bag so
you<00:01:42.619> don't<00:01:42.799> have<00:01:42.979> stuff<00:01:43.159> flying<00:01:43.429> everywhere

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
you don't have stuff flying everywhere

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.459 
you don't have stuff flying everywhere
it<00:01:43.909> makes<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.209> a<00:01:44.270> lot<00:01:44.450> easier<00:01:44.509> okay<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.229> now

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
it makes it a lot easier okay so now

it makes it a lot easier okay so now
what<00:01:45.590> we're<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.009> we're<00:01:46.159> going<00:01:46.189> to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.010 
what we're going to do we're going to
lay<00:01:46.459> some<00:01:46.670> tape<00:01:46.880> out<00:01:47.149> on<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.359> bench<00:01:47.569> for<00:01:47.899> when

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
lay some tape out on the bench for when

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.510 
lay some tape out on the bench for when
we<00:01:48.140> actually<00:01:48.439> wrap<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.770> packing<00:01:49.069> around<00:01:49.250> just

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
we actually wrap the packing around just

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.219 
we actually wrap the packing around just
to<00:01:49.609> hold<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.909> in<00:01:50.030> place<00:01:50.149> makes<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.079> lot

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
to hold it in place makes it a lot

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.929 
to hold it in place makes it a lot
easier<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.679> assemble<00:01:51.979> back<00:01:52.310> into<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.670> can<00:01:52.819> it

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
easier to assemble back into the can it

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.639 
easier to assemble back into the can it
doesn't<00:01:53.119> need<00:01:53.329> to<00:01:53.390> be<00:01:53.450> high<00:01:53.659> temp<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.319> just

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
doesn't need to be high temp it just

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.020 
doesn't need to be high temp it just
needs<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:54.950> be<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> good<00:01:55.189> old-fashioned<00:01:55.670> masking

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
needs to be a good old-fashioned masking

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.059 
needs to be a good old-fashioned masking
tape<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:57.679> get<00:01:57.799> our<00:01:57.979> cool<00:01:59.799> we'll<00:02:00.799> just<00:02:00.950> put

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
tape then we get our cool we'll just put

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.260 
tape then we get our cool we'll just put
another<00:02:01.280> one<00:02:01.459> down<00:02:01.489> through<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> center

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
another one down through the center

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.029 
another one down through the center
there<00:02:02.420> now<00:02:02.719> that<00:02:02.780> it's<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.890> for

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
there now that it's on just for

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.069 
there now that it's on just for
safekeeping<00:02:04.250> now<00:02:05.179> what<00:02:05.329> we<00:02:05.450> need<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:05.689> do<00:02:05.840> is

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
safekeeping now what we need to do is

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.779 
safekeeping now what we need to do is
just<00:02:06.439> get<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.709> inserted<00:02:07.250> back<00:02:07.340> inside<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
just get that inserted back inside the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.460 
just get that inserted back inside the
silencer<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.629> helps<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.989> have<00:02:09.079> something<00:02:09.440> like

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
silencer it helps to have something like

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.020 
silencer it helps to have something like
this<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.829> can<00:02:09.979> actually<00:02:10.009> put<00:02:10.429> down<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:10.819> give

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
this you can actually put down so give

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.460 
this you can actually put down so give
yourself<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.750> guide<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.319> then

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
yourself a bit of a guide you can then

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.259 
yourself a bit of a guide you can then
line<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.860> two<00:02:13.010> centers<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:13.549> and<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.090> just

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
line the two centers up and it just

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.300 
line the two centers up and it just
makes<00:02:14.420> life<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> lot<00:02:14.989> easier<00:02:15.049> we<00:02:15.769> just<00:02:15.980> need<00:02:16.129> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
makes life a lot easier we just need to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.539 
makes life a lot easier we just need to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
I suggest just a little bit of high temp

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.640 
I suggest just a little bit of high temp
silicon<00:02:32.569> just<00:02:32.780> rub<00:02:33.019> it<00:02:33.139> around<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.500> edge

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
silicon just rub it around that edge

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.170 
silicon just rub it around that edge
there<00:02:33.859> it's<00:02:34.280> not<00:02:34.519> an<00:02:34.639> essential<00:02:34.910> but

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
there it's not an essential but

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.610 
there it's not an essential but
certainly<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.569> good<00:02:35.780> way<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.959> finish<00:02:36.319> them<00:02:36.470> off

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
certainly a good way to finish them off

certainly a good way to finish them off
okay<00:02:37.340> guys<00:02:37.549> just<00:02:37.579> remembered<00:02:38.180> noise<00:02:38.480> does<00:02:38.810> not

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
okay guys just remembered noise does not

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.780 
okay guys just remembered noise does not
equal<00:02:39.200> power<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.739> quarter<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.370> answer<00:02:40.579> okay

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
equal power a quarter so answer okay

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.339 
equal power a quarter so answer okay

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
opened and you'll actually gain power

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:54.030 
opened and you'll actually gain power
