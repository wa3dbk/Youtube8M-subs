handles<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.570> we<00:00:53.170> notice<00:00:53.530> when<00:00:53.680> people<00:00:53.980> came

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
handles and we notice when people came

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.760 
handles and we notice when people came
in<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:54.610> had<00:00:54.820> both<00:00:55.270> areas<00:00:55.870> treated<00:00:56.380> they<00:00:56.560> got<00:00:56.740> a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
in and had both areas treated they got a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.010 
in and had both areas treated they got a
much<00:00:57.100> better<00:00:57.280> overall<00:00:57.790> result<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.780> were<00:00:58.870> much

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
much better overall result and were much

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.890 
much better overall result and were much
happier<00:00:59.380> with<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.490> treatment<00:01:00.880> itself<00:01:01.180> we

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
happier with the treatment itself we

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.380 
happier with the treatment itself we
started<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.790> discuss<00:01:03.790> that<00:01:04.000> with<00:01:04.210> our

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
started to discuss that with our

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.149 
started to discuss that with our
patients<00:01:04.839> before<00:01:05.170> we<00:01:05.290> did<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.560> treatment<00:01:05.799> and

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
patients before we did the treatment and

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.039 
patients before we did the treatment and
so<00:01:06.400> we're<00:01:06.549> doing<00:01:06.700> more<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.210> more<00:01:07.420> what<00:01:07.900> we

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
so we're doing more and more what we

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.630 
so we're doing more and more what we
would<00:01:08.200> call<00:01:08.320> circumferential<00:01:09.190> treatments

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
would call circumferential treatments

would call circumferential treatments
that<00:01:10.390> is<00:01:10.600> treating<00:01:10.960> both<00:01:11.140> love<00:01:11.350> handles<00:01:11.770> in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
that is treating both love handles in

during this process and we kind of look
at<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.909> target<00:01:40.330> area<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.960> try<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.830> determine

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
the area and I can detect with that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.140 
the area and I can detect with that
pinching<00:01:59.229> how<00:01:59.409> much<00:01:59.619> tissue<00:02:00.150> particularly

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
pinching how much tissue particularly

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.969 
pinching how much tissue particularly
the<00:02:01.210> skin<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.990> fat<00:02:02.170> layer<00:02:02.439> will<00:02:02.710> kind<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
the skin and the fat layer will kind of

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.620 
the skin and the fat layer will kind of
come<00:02:03.159> up<00:02:03.310> into<00:02:03.460> my<00:02:03.610> fingers<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.299> see<00:02:04.479> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
come up into my fingers and I see the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.630 
come up into my fingers and I see the
distance<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:05.619> then<00:02:05.830> after<00:02:06.159> we've<00:02:06.340> made<00:02:06.520> our

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
distance so then after we've made our

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.550 
distance so then after we've made our
marks<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.150> remove<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.659> gel<00:02:07.900> pad<00:02:08.140> from<00:02:08.379> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
marks we remove the gel pad from the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.679 
marks we remove the gel pad from the
packet<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.189> have<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.909> be<00:02:10.000> very<00:02:10.209> careful<00:02:10.599> when

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
packet and have to be very careful when

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.720 
packet and have to be very careful when
we<00:02:10.780> lift<00:02:11.049> this<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.650> apply<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
we lift this up and apply that to the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.510 
we lift this up and apply that to the
treatment<00:02:13.120> area<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.709> then<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.740> like<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.190> smooth

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
treatment area and then I like to smooth

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430 
treatment area and then I like to smooth
it<00:02:15.700> out<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.120> make<00:02:16.240> it's<00:02:16.480> nice<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.990> smooth<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
it out to make it's nice and smooth and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.890 
it out to make it's nice and smooth and
there's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
there's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.899 
there's
wrinkles<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.709> evenly<00:02:19.069> placed<00:02:19.459> over<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
wrinkles and it's evenly placed over the

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.780 
wrinkles and it's evenly placed over the
treatment<00:02:20.269> area<00:02:20.769> then<00:02:21.769> we'll<00:02:22.280> go<00:02:22.459> ahead<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
treatment area then we'll go ahead and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.819 
treatment area then we'll go ahead and
I'll<00:02:23.090> take<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.629> correct<00:02:24.049> applicator<00:02:24.590> that

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
I'll take the correct applicator that

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.759 
I'll take the correct applicator that
I've<00:02:24.950> chosen<00:02:25.159> prior<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> treatment<00:02:26.769> set

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
I've chosen prior to the treatment set

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.339 
I've chosen prior to the treatment set
the<00:02:27.980> device<00:02:28.280> setting<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.599> then<00:02:29.810> turn<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.110> on

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
the device setting and then turn it on

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.660 
the device setting and then turn it on
turn<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.829> suction<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.670> then<00:02:32.180> apply<00:02:32.599> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
turn the suction on and then apply the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.429 
turn the suction on and then apply the
device<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.239> treatment<00:02:35.629> area<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:36.409> a

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
device to the treatment area with a

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.869 
device to the treatment area with a
little<00:02:36.769> bit<00:02:36.859> of<00:02:36.950> pressure<00:02:37.159> so<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.609> I<00:02:37.670> get<00:02:37.849> a

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
little bit of pressure so that I get a

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.699 
little bit of pressure so that I get a
good<00:02:38.060> seal<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.659> it<00:02:38.750> sucks<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.200> tissue<00:02:39.409> up

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
good seal and it sucks the tissue up

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.910 
good seal and it sucks the tissue up
with<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.609> CoolSculpting<00:02:41.329> procedure<00:02:41.709> most<00:02:42.709> of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
with the CoolSculpting procedure most of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.190 
with the CoolSculpting procedure most of
time<00:02:43.129> it's<00:02:43.340> not<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.730> people<00:02:43.909> that<00:02:44.840> have<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
time it's not that people that have the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.830 
time it's not that people that have the
treatment<00:02:45.590> will<00:02:45.829> notice<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.060> they've<00:02:47.329> lost

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
treatment will notice that they've lost

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.259 
treatment will notice that they've lost
a<00:02:48.140> pant<00:02:48.379> size<00:02:48.650> or<00:02:49.099> that<00:02:49.250> friends<00:02:49.849> will<00:02:50.000> come<00:02:50.150> up

weight
they<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:52.909> feel<00:02:53.299> slimmer<00:02:53.720> their<00:02:54.019> pants<00:02:54.379> fit<00:02:54.590> a

they just feel slimmer their pants fit a
little<00:02:54.829> bit<00:02:54.980> better<00:02:55.159> when<00:02:55.849> they<00:02:56.000> sit<00:02:56.269> down

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
little bit better when they sit down

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.180 
little bit better when they sit down
they<00:02:56.510> notice<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.379> extra<00:02:57.739> little<00:02:58.010> role

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
they notice that the extra little role

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.610 
they notice that the extra little role
that<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.579> there<00:02:58.790> isn't<00:02:59.269> as<00:02:59.359> noticeable<00:02:59.620> well

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
that was there isn't as noticeable well

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.550 
that was there isn't as noticeable well
ultimately<00:03:01.510> people<00:03:02.510> will<00:03:02.599> see<00:03:02.810> result<00:03:03.260> after

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
ultimately people will see result after

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.309 
ultimately people will see result after
one<00:03:03.980> treatment<00:03:04.629> there<00:03:05.629> are<00:03:05.659> some<00:03:05.989> people<00:03:06.139> that

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
one treatment there are some people that

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.009 
one treatment there are some people that
want<00:03:06.620> more<00:03:07.310> efficacy<00:03:07.760> with<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.420> treatment<00:03:08.810> so

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
want more efficacy with the treatment so

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.929 
want more efficacy with the treatment so
then<00:03:09.230> we'll<00:03:09.409> go<00:03:09.620> ahead<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> subsequent

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
then we'll go ahead and do a subsequent

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.149 
then we'll go ahead and do a subsequent
treatment<00:03:11.689> and<00:03:11.840> we<00:03:11.989> usually<00:03:12.379> wait<00:03:12.530> about<00:03:12.739> two

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
treatment and we usually wait about two

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.580 
treatment and we usually wait about two
months<00:03:13.549> prior<00:03:14.359> to<00:03:14.420> deciding<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.260> do<00:03:15.409> that

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
months prior to deciding to do that

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.340 
months prior to deciding to do that
second<00:03:15.980> treatment
