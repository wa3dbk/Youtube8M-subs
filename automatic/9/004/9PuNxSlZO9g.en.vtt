going to play it the lowest difficulty
for<00:00:24.180> now<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:25.099> give<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.250> idea<00:00:26.279> okay

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
for now just to give you an idea okay

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.990 
for now just to give you an idea okay
and<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.050> basically<00:00:28.680> tap<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> select<00:00:29.670> your

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and so basically tap to select your

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120 
and so basically tap to select your
planet<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> green<00:00:31.560> planets<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
planet you are the green planets you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.389 
planet you are the green planets you
want<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> attack<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.450> orange<00:00:34.230> planets<00:00:34.770> then

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
want to attack the orange planets then

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
want to attack the orange planets then
you<00:00:35.489> choose<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> target<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> choose<00:00:37.559> who

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you choose a target so you choose who

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
you choose a target so you choose who
you<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> attacker<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.860> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you want to be the attacker then you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.130 
you want to be the attacker then you
send<00:00:41.100> over<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.550> guys<00:00:44.690> okay<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
send over some guys okay and so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.310 
send over some guys okay and so
basically<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:46.710> number<00:00:47.039> 55<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
basically there's number 55 on here and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.750 
basically there's number 55 on here and
there's<00:00:49.320> number<00:00:49.590> 3<00:00:49.770> over<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.520> tap

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
there's number 3 over here so if we tap

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.900 
there's number 3 over here so if we tap
once<00:00:51.800> it'll<00:00:52.800> fill<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.309> away<00:00:53.399> cuz<00:00:53.610> such<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
once it'll fill up right away cuz such a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.650 
once it'll fill up right away cuz such a
low<00:00:54.120> number<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.340> double<00:00:56.820> tab<00:00:57.030> but

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
low number and then if we double tab but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
low number and then if we double tab but
this<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.370> can<00:00:59.370> send<00:00:59.609> them<00:01:00.079> we<00:01:01.079> basically<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.859> slot

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
this I can send them we basically a slot

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.469 
this I can send them we basically a slot
we<00:01:02.820> basically<00:01:03.920> assign<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.280> every<00:01:05.939> single

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
we basically assign like every single

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.920 
we basically assign like every single
planet<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.750> one

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
planet that you have it to this one

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.890 
planet that you have it to this one
planet<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> burst<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.390> each<00:01:12.689> one

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
planet and you get a burst from each one

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.670 
planet and you get a burst from each one
of<00:01:12.930> them<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> yeah<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.479> basically<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of them so yeah that's basically how it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.719 
of them so yeah that's basically how it
goes<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> orange<00:01:19.229> planets<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
goes the orange planets are the and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
goes the orange planets are the and
these<00:01:22.280> other<00:01:23.280> planets<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:25.049> great

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
these other planets and these great

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.539 
these other planets and these great
planes<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> neutral<00:01:26.040> planets<00:01:26.400> which

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
planes are the neutral planets which

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
planes are the neutral planets which
means<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.869> aren't<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> try<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
means that they aren't going to try to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.810 
means that they aren't going to try to
attack<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.070> anything<00:01:29.250> bad<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> you
