wall<00:02:19.110> sites<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.980> spinning<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> pen<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.570> coil

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
wall sites on spinning the pen the coil

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.740 
wall sites on spinning the pen the coil
will<00:02:22.110> spin<00:02:22.140> inside<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> magnets<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.540> LED

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
will spin inside the magnets and the LED

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.170 
will spin inside the magnets and the LED
would<00:02:25.200> light<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.520> see<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.850> much

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
would light up you can see this much

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140 
would light up you can see this much
better<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> dark<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.890> spin<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.550> pen

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
better in the dark if you spin the pen

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.140 
better in the dark if you spin the pen
the<00:02:30.660> coil<00:02:30.959> spins<00:02:31.410> between<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.459> magnets<00:02:32.820> and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the coil spins between the magnets and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.020 
the coil spins between the magnets and
EMF<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.720> generated<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.920> LED<00:02:34.950> lights<00:02:35.640> up

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
EMF is generated and the LED lights up

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360 
EMF is generated and the LED lights up
now<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.080> variation<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:38.070> rubber

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
now this is the variation this rubber

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.800 
now this is the variation this rubber
wooden<00:02:38.670> base<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> piece<00:02:39.630> of

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
wooden base you can have a piece of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.940 
wooden base you can have a piece of
rubber<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.920> four<00:02:41.160> pencils<00:02:41.730> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
rubber you can have four pencils and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.120 
rubber you can have four pencils and
once<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.190> spin<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.060> pen<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:46.170> magnets<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
once you spin the pen the magnets the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.890 
once you spin the pen the magnets the
coil<00:02:47.480> rotates

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
coil rotates

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.330 
coil rotates
inside<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> magnets<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.110> LED<00:02:52.110> lights<00:02:52.680> up

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
inside the magnets and the LED lights up

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.959 
inside the magnets and the LED lights up
just<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.269> lighthouse<00:02:54.510> generator
