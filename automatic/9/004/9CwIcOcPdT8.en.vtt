no I'm not applying that also check on
the<00:02:13.810> curtain<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.560> hora<00:02:14.800> Torian<00:02:15.430> from<00:02:15.640> time

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
the curtain in the hora Torian from time

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.990 
the curtain in the hora Torian from time
to<00:02:16.090> time<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:17.020> character<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.100> seems<00:02:18.520> to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
to time the character in there seems to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.590 
to time the character in there seems to
be<00:02:19.420> unique<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.380> he<00:02:20.830> becomes<00:02:21.250> more<00:02:21.700> active<00:02:22.030> if

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
be unique and he becomes more active if

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.140 
be unique and he becomes more active if
the<00:02:22.750> cameras<00:02:23.230> remain<00:02:23.590> off<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:24.250> long<00:02:24.490> periods

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the cameras remain off for long periods

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.300 
the cameras remain off for long periods
of<00:02:25.270> time<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.930> guess<00:02:26.380> he<00:02:26.710> doesn't<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.130> being

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
of time I guess he doesn't like being

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.000 
of time I guess he doesn't like being
