00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
but it's like you have to buy a card for
it<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.610> something<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.119> can't<00:01:09.960> remember<00:01:10.020> but

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
it or something I can't remember but

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.289 
it or something I can't remember but
there<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> reason<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.189> didn't<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
there was a reason I didn't want it so I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.270 
there was a reason I didn't want it so I
bought<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.840> red<00:01:13.439> crimson<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> actually

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
bought a red crimson one I actually

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.179 
bought a red crimson one I actually
bought<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> used<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.009> for<00:01:17.009> ten

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
bought it used because then I for ten

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
bought it used because then I for ten
dollars<00:01:17.580> got<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> full<00:01:18.600> year<00:01:19.590> replacement<00:01:19.890> plan

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
dollars got a full year replacement plan

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.890 
dollars got a full year replacement plan
so<00:01:20.610> essentially<00:01:20.970> i<00:01:21.119> could<00:01:21.390> throw<00:01:21.630> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so essentially i could throw this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.929 
so essentially i could throw this
against<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> wall<00:01:22.590> they<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.369> scan<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> bar

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
against a wall they would scan the bar

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.370 
against a wall they would scan the bar
code<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.420> back<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.780> give<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.080> new<00:01:25.229> one
