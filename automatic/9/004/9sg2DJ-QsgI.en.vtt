it's<00:01:08.350> basically<00:01:09.010> like<00:01:09.420> another<00:01:10.420> form<00:01:10.869> of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
it's basically like another form of

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.410 
it's basically like another form of
wheel<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.070> guess<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.400> could<00:01:12.580> say<00:01:12.820> because<00:01:13.300> all

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
wheel I guess you could say because all

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.370 
wheel I guess you could say because all
you<00:01:13.540> do<00:01:13.690> is<00:01:14.310> cornrow<00:01:15.310> all<00:01:15.850> your<00:01:16.450> hair<00:01:16.720> straight

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
you do is cornrow all your hair straight

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.650 
you do is cornrow all your hair straight
back<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.960> weave<00:01:20.200> hair<00:01:20.620> along<00:01:21.190> each<00:01:22.060> corn

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
back and your weave hair along each corn

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.810 
back and your weave hair along each corn
roll<00:01:22.990> along<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:25.380> hair<00:01:26.380> braiding<00:01:26.920> hair<00:01:27.100> so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
roll along it with hair braiding hair so

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.700 
roll along it with hair braiding hair so
it's<00:01:28.300> nice<00:01:28.540> because<00:01:28.810> none<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.170> your<00:01:29.410> hair<00:01:29.590> is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
it's nice because none of your hair is

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.340 
it's nice because none of your hair is
exposed<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:31.120> gets<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.480> rest<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.110> you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
exposed and it gets to rest and you

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.520 
exposed and it gets to rest and you
don't<00:01:32.560> manipulate<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.180> father<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.380> and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
don't manipulate it and father it and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.800 
don't manipulate it and father it and
you<00:01:35.770> know<00:01:35.890> induced<00:01:36.330> breakage<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.510> all<00:01:37.630> that

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
you know induced breakage and all that
