is using the repair function with the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
is using the repair function with the

magnet gun so what you can do is the
magnet<00:00:48.510> gun<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> pretty<00:00:49.260> simple<00:00:49.469> tool

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
magnet gun is it's a pretty simple tool

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
magnet gun is it's a pretty simple tool
to<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.399> guys<00:00:50.550> will<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> chance<00:00:50.850> to

destructible target fire the second

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
destructible target fire the second
projectile<00:00:57.000> wherever<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.809> first

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
one to go it's pretty easy to do it and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
one to go it's pretty easy to do it and
so<00:01:01.020> Dan<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.399> tricks<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.730> love

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
so Dan will do one of the tricks we love

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060 
so Dan will do one of the tricks we love
doing<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.199> ammo<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.769> take<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
doing is you use it as ammo you take the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.200 
doing is you use it as ammo you take the
side<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> building<00:01:05.580> bling<00:01:06.060> into

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
side of the building bling into

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480 
side of the building bling into
something<00:01:06.630> repair<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> fling<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.250> another

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
something repair it fling it out another

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
something repair it fling it out another
enemy<00:01:08.700> again<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.650> instant

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
enemy again it's like you have instant

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240 
enemy again it's like you have instant
ammo<00:01:11.280> whenever<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.130> now

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ammo whenever you want it and so now

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740 
ammo whenever you want it and so now
just<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> show<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> singularity

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
just going to show you the singularity

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
just going to show you the singularity
cannon<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.189> creates<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> small<00:01:17.970> black

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
cannon so this creates a small black

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
cannon so this creates a small black
hole<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.020> keeps<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.560> anything

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
hole and it just keeps up anything

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
hole and it just keeps up anything
that's<00:01:20.070> around<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.659> explodes<00:01:21.659> everything

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that's around it explodes everything

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
that's around it explodes everything
kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> keeps<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.799> stasis<00:01:22.830> before<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
kind of keeps them in stasis before it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
kind of keeps them in stasis before it
drops<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> weapon<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> get

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
drops down this is a weapon that you get

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
drops down this is a weapon that you get
a<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.310> bit<00:01:26.490> later<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:26.970> game<00:01:27.210> -

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
a little bit later in the game -

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
a little bit later in the game -
it's<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> higher-end<00:01:28.560> weapons<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
it's one of the higher-end weapons and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550 
it's one of the higher-end weapons and
it<00:01:30.180> does<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.899> tremendous<00:01:31.140> amount<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it does a pretty tremendous amount of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.620 
it does a pretty tremendous amount of
destruction<00:01:34.579> here<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> plasma<00:01:36.210> beam

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
destruction here is the plasma beam

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.910 
destruction here is the plasma beam
weapon<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.500> favorites
