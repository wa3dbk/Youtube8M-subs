00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
carrier and I technically want at this

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.830 
carrier and I technically want at this
point<00:01:21.319> after<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.099> destroyed<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.750> even<00:01:23.750> though<00:01:23.810> I

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
point after I destroyed it even though I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.139 
point after I destroyed it even though I
hadn't<00:01:24.200> taken<00:01:24.380> any<00:01:24.619> other<00:01:24.679> islands<00:01:25.160> yet<00:01:25.340> but

hadn't taken any other islands yet but

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.169 
hadn't taken any other islands yet but
usually<00:01:26.660> you<00:01:26.780> have<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.050> go<00:01:27.410> through<00:01:28.179> attack

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
usually you have to go through attack

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.940 
usually you have to go through attack
their<00:01:29.450> Island<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.080> take<00:01:30.110> their<00:01:30.470> islands

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
their Island you take their islands

which is pretty RTS like that portion of

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.740 
which is pretty RTS like that portion of
it<00:01:35.149> and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.300 

when<00:01:38.750> their<00:01:38.900> carriers<00:01:39.500> actually<00:01:39.830> live<00:01:40.010> it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
huge maps each island takes a long time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.870 
huge maps each island takes a long time
to<00:02:11.200> take<00:02:12.200> over<00:02:12.530> depending<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:13.250> its<00:02:13.400> strength

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
to take over depending on its strength

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.030 
to take over depending on its strength
each<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:14.840> has<00:02:14.959> different<00:02:14.990> defenses<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
each one has different defenses and a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.620 
each one has different defenses and a
different<00:02:16.340> type<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> mining

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
different type it can be like a mining

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.449 
different type it can be like a mining
islands<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.610> production<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.980> when<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.100> get

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
islands or production and when you get

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.860 
islands or production and when you get
to<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.940> need<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.120> come<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.810> take<00:02:23.959> the

to it you need to come in and take the
headquarters<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:29.300> usually<00:02:29.420> not<00:02:29.630> that

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
headquarters but it's usually not that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.500 
headquarters but it's usually not that
simple<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.520> map<00:02:31.760> we're<00:02:32.000> seeing

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
simple like on the map we're seeing

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.979 
simple like on the map we're seeing
right<00:02:32.630> now<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.030> their<00:02:35.209> islands<00:02:35.810> that

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
right now is one of their islands that

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.930 
right now is one of their islands that
I'm<00:02:36.110> attacking<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.860> each<00:02:37.489> part<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
I'm attacking and each part of the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.660 
I'm attacking and each part of the
island<00:02:38.090> has<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> shield<00:02:38.870> generator<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:40.550> they

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
island has a shield generator so they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.250 
island has a shield generator so they
have<00:02:40.790> shield<00:02:41.030> generators<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.750> each<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.200> these

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
have shield generators and each of these

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.660 
have shield generators and each of these
little<00:02:42.410> bases<00:02:42.830> around<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.130> island<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:43.580> you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
little bases around the island and you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.920 
little bases around the island and you
have<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.910> go<00:02:44.030> around<00:02:44.090> destroy<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.780> shield

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
have to go around destroy the shield

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.220 
have to go around destroy the shield
generators<00:02:45.440> here<00:02:45.590> for<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.040> take<00:02:46.220> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
generators here for you can take the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.270 
generators here for you can take the
headquarters<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.790> right<00:02:49.790> now<00:02:50.290> I'm<00:02:51.290> trying<00:02:52.190> to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
headquarters and right now I'm trying to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.620 
headquarters and right now I'm trying to

their fences teach part of an island

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.220 
their fences teach part of an island
will<00:02:56.570> have<00:02:56.720> some<00:02:56.959> kind<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.489> base<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:59.299> you<00:03:00.080> can

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
vehicles but you have to be pretty close

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.550 
vehicles but you have to be pretty close
to<00:03:11.070> hit<00:03:11.550> things<00:03:11.730> from<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.210> ship<00:03:12.380> right<00:03:13.380> there

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
to hit things from your ship right there

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.630 
to hit things from your ship right there
when<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.770> was<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:13.980> shooting<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.370> wasn't

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
when I was just shooting it wasn't

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.950 
when I was just shooting it wasn't
actually<00:03:14.730> hitting<00:03:15.030> anything<00:03:15.240> i<00:03:15.450> sent<00:03:15.660> realize

actually hitting anything i sent realize

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.130 
actually hitting anything i sent realize
it<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:17.010> usually<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.460> to<00:03:17.520> bring<00:03:17.820> out<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
it you usually have to bring out the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.650 
it you usually have to bring out the
area<00:03:19.350> code<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.860> ground<00:03:20.100> vehicles<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
area code the ground vehicles and the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.500 
area code the ground vehicles and the
air<00:03:21.810> vehicles<00:03:22.200> are<00:03:22.320> really<00:03:22.530> good<00:03:22.740> alone

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
air vehicles are really good alone

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.700 
air vehicles are really good alone
there's<00:03:24.510> something<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.080> best<00:03:25.260> vehicles

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
there's something like the best vehicles

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.160 
there's something like the best vehicles
to<00:03:25.920> manually<00:03:26.430> control<00:03:26.820> she<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.870> do<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.990> lot

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
to manually control she can do a lot

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.720 
to manually control she can do a lot
with<00:03:28.230> them<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.860> can<00:03:28.980> easily<00:03:29.160> go<00:03:29.490> around

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
with them and you can easily go around

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.720 
with them and you can easily go around
take<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.270> fences<00:03:31.010> unless<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.400> really

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
take out the fences unless it's a really

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.580 
take out the fences unless it's a really
strong<00:03:33.060> island<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.840> really<00:03:34.110> strong<00:03:34.320> island

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
strong island the really strong island

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.400 
strong island the really strong island
it'll<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.220> destroy<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.360> haven't<00:03:37.350> even

really figured out how to fight the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.610 
really figured out how to fight the
strongest<00:03:39.120> types<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.480> islands<00:03:39.840> yet<00:03:40.020> state<00:03:40.500> is

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
strongest types of islands yet state is

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.720 
strongest types of islands yet state is
tear<00:03:41.040> through<00:03:41.310> all<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.550> stuff<00:03:42.410> but<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:44.280> ground

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
tear through all my stuff but the ground

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.730 
tear through all my stuff but the ground
vehicles<00:03:45.150> work<00:03:45.330> pretty<00:03:45.570> well<00:03:45.660> together<00:03:46.080> but

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
vehicles work pretty well together but

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.290 
vehicles work pretty well together but
all<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.190> Friendly<00:03:47.580> AI<00:03:47.790> kind<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.510> suffers<00:03:49.170> from

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
all the Friendly AI kind of suffers from

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.030 
all the Friendly AI kind of suffers from
problems<00:03:51.980> they<00:03:52.980> don't<00:03:53.160> work<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:54.150> well<00:03:55.040> it's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
problems they don't work that well it's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.220 
problems they don't work that well it's
really<00:03:56.340> good<00:03:56.610> at<00:03:56.760> destroying<00:03:57.240> other<00:03:57.660> vehicles

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
really good at destroying other vehicles

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.880 
really good at destroying other vehicles
and<00:03:59.010> fighting<00:03:59.670> each<00:03:59.790> other<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.330> they're<00:04:00.480> not

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
and fighting each other but they're not

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.890 
and fighting each other but they're not
good<00:04:01.890> at<00:04:02.310> helping<00:04:02.610> each<00:04:03.000> other<00:04:03.180> or<00:04:03.600> staying

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
good at helping each other or staying

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.530 
good at helping each other or staying
near<00:04:04.260> each<00:04:04.380> other<00:04:04.880> there<00:04:05.880> are<00:04:06.030> assists

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
near each other there are assists

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.480 
near each other there are assists
command<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.350> make<00:04:07.560> vehicles<00:04:07.980> stay

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
command so you can make vehicles stay

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.080 
command so you can make vehicles stay
with<00:04:08.730> other<00:04:08.940> vehicles<00:04:09.740> but<00:04:10.740> they're<00:04:11.550> not<00:04:11.790> all

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
with other vehicles but they're not all

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.060 
with other vehicles but they're not all
that<00:04:12.270> easy<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.870> use<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.710> doesn't<00:04:14.010> work

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
that easy to use it just doesn't work

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.039 
that easy to use it just doesn't work
all<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.400> well<00:04:14.460> so<00:04:15.150> hopefully<00:04:15.270> it'll<00:04:15.570> fix<00:04:15.780> up

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
all that well so hopefully it'll fix up

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.039 
all that well so hopefully it'll fix up
that<00:04:16.470> day<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.400> am<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.910> lot<00:04:18.120> more<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:18.900> still

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
that day I am a lot more if it's still

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.510 
that day I am a lot more if it's still
in<00:04:19.170> beta<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:21.320> right<00:04:22.320> now<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:22.740> still<00:04:23.010> pretty

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
in beta but right now it's still pretty

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.680 
in beta but right now it's still pretty
fun<00:04:23.790> even<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:25.370> it's<00:04:26.370> just<00:04:26.690> impossible

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
fun even with that it's just impossible

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.360 
fun even with that it's just impossible
to<00:04:29.360> try<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.420> rely<00:04:31.020> on<00:04:31.050> your<00:04:31.470> AI<00:04:31.620> sometimes

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
to try to rely on your AI sometimes

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.330 
to try to rely on your AI sometimes
especially<00:04:32.910> on<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.450> really<00:04:33.720> strong<00:04:34.340> islands

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
especially on that really strong islands

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
is later on in the same island we took

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.280 
is later on in the same island we took
out<00:04:43.080> all<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.290> shield<00:04:43.590> generators<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:45.290> I'm

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290

sending in one of my ground vehicles to

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.720 
sending in one of my ground vehicles to
come<00:04:49.470> set<00:04:49.800> up<00:04:49.890> new<00:04:50.070> headquarters<00:04:51.020> when<00:04:52.020> do<00:04:52.170> you

headquarters<00:04:59.670> and<00:04:59.820> leave<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:01.020> island<00:05:01.080> will

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
headquarters and leave the island will

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.480 
headquarters and leave the island will
retake<00:05:03.630> itself<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.740> don't<00:05:04.830> need<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.130> do

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
like this one where the shield

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.320 
like this one where the shield
generators<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.820> there's<00:05:18.720> other<00:05:18.930> ones<00:05:19.110> were

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
stuff the one is going down right here

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.439 
stuff the one is going down right here
is<00:05:26.729> a<00:05:27.290> production

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
is a production

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.059 
is a production
module<00:05:30.319> and<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.419> also<00:05:32.659> come<00:05:33.080> in<00:05:33.319> and<00:05:33.770> use

command center and take it it's a lot

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.850 
command center and take it it's a lot
quicker<00:05:39.110> but<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:40.039> have<00:05:40.219> to<00:05:40.490> shift<00:05:40.969> those<00:05:41.240> in

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
quicker but you have to shift those in

get from certain islands and right now
I'm<00:06:01.430> just<00:06:01.460> kind<00:06:01.819> of<00:06:01.909> showing<00:06:02.389> off<00:06:02.599> the

I'm just kind of showing off the

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.559 
I'm just kind of showing off the
different<00:06:02.990> types<00:06:03.080> of<00:06:03.199> islands<00:06:03.650> this<00:06:03.830> is<00:06:03.979> the

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
different types of islands this is the

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.649 
different types of islands this is the
snow<00:06:05.569> on<00:06:05.949> their<00:06:06.949> barren<00:06:07.610> ones<00:06:07.879> it's<00:06:08.270> jungle

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.600 
snow on their barren ones it's jungle
once<00:06:08.870> or<00:06:09.169> swamp<00:06:09.469> ones<00:06:10.479> snow<00:06:11.479> one's<00:06:11.689> pretty

once or swamp ones snow one's pretty
great<00:06:13.610> looking<00:06:14.120> graphically<00:06:14.900> it's<00:06:15.050> fantastic

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
great looking graphically it's fantastic

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.850 
great looking graphically it's fantastic
I<00:06:16.569> was<00:06:17.569> even<00:06:17.719> there<00:06:17.930> when<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.169> blizzard<00:06:18.560> started

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
I was even there when a blizzard started

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.790 
I was even there when a blizzard started
going<00:06:19.159> later<00:06:19.430> and<00:06:19.789> it<00:06:19.909> started<00:06:20.529> freezing<00:06:21.529> up

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
going later and it started freezing up

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.689 
going later and it started freezing up
all<00:06:21.979> the<00:06:22.039> screens<00:06:22.339> of<00:06:22.460> all<00:06:22.580> my<00:06:22.699> vehicles<00:06:23.469> but

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
all the screens of all my vehicles but

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.489 
all the screens of all my vehicles but
they<00:06:25.699> definitely<00:06:25.939> nailed<00:06:26.479> the<00:06:26.749> graphics<00:06:27.229> they

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
they definitely nailed the graphics they

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:29.649 
they definitely nailed the graphics they
just<00:06:27.680> need<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.800> work<00:06:27.979> on<00:06:28.159> the<00:06:28.370> RTS<00:06:28.999> portion<00:06:29.539> of

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
just need to work on the RTS portion of

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.550 
just need to work on the RTS portion of
the<00:06:29.719> game<00:06:29.899> and<00:06:31.270> get<00:06:32.270> that<00:06:32.419> a<00:06:32.479> lot<00:06:32.629> smoother<00:06:33.050> the

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
the game and get that a lot smoother the

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.709 
the game and get that a lot smoother the
controls<00:06:33.979> are<00:06:34.129> pretty<00:06:34.189> good<00:06:34.550> for<00:06:35.330> manually

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 
controls are pretty good for manually

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.420 
controls are pretty good for manually
controlling<00:06:36.050> the<00:06:36.199> stuff<00:06:37.389> but<00:06:38.389> it's<00:06:39.050> pretty

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
controlling the stuff but it's pretty

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.860 
controlling the stuff but it's pretty
punishing<00:06:40.430> to<00:06:40.639> lose<00:06:40.849> the<00:06:40.969> ship<00:06:41.029> like<00:06:41.599> if<00:06:41.719> I'd
