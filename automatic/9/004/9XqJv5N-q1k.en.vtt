00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it under budget let's have a look at the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
it under budget let's have a look at the
ingredients<00:00:49.080> we'll<00:00:49.470> be<00:00:49.590> using<00:00:49.739> today<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
ingredients we'll be using today so to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.330 
ingredients we'll be using today so to
start<00:00:51.900> off<00:00:52.050> we've<00:00:52.290> got<00:00:52.320> three<00:00:52.860> hard-boiled

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
start off we've got three hard-boiled

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
start off we've got three hard-boiled
eggs<00:00:53.970> there<00:00:54.480> yet<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.050> shown<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.559> I'll<00:00:55.800> move

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
eggs there yet to be shown but I'll move

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.790 
eggs there yet to be shown but I'll move
on<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> great<00:00:56.910> source<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> protein<00:00:58.170> very

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
on to that great source of protein very

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.070 
on to that great source of protein very
highly<00:00:59.309> absorbed<00:00:59.730> by<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.970> body<00:01:00.120> quick<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
highly absorbed by the body quick and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.569 
highly absorbed by the body quick and
easy<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.379> come<00:01:01.559> by<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.739> pretty<00:01:02.040> relatively

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
easy to come by and pretty relatively

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
easy to come by and pretty relatively
cheap<00:01:02.970> compared<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.450> other<00:01:03.600> sources<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
cheap compared to other sources of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.609 
cheap compared to other sources of
protein<00:01:05.330> after<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.450> we're<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> have

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
protein after that we're going to have

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.859 
protein after that we're going to have
some<00:01:07.800> albacore<00:01:08.280> tuna<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.300> water<00:01:09.509> as

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
some albacore tuna this is in water as

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
some albacore tuna this is in water as
opposed<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.440> sunflower<00:01:10.740> oil<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.670> therefore

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
opposed to sunflower oil so therefore

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.749 
opposed to sunflower oil so therefore
another<00:01:12.810> good<00:01:13.080> source<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.530> complete<00:01:14.520> amino

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
another good source of complete amino

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.240 
another good source of complete amino
acids<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.600> protein<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.290> three<00:01:17.040> eggs

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
acids from that protein so three eggs

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
acids from that protein so three eggs
and<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.850> protein<00:01:18.300> will<00:01:18.479> probably<00:01:19.020> give<00:01:19.229> us

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and this protein will probably give us

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.800 
and this protein will probably give us
within<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> region<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.759> 40<00:01:21.330> grams<00:01:21.539> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
within the region of about 40 grams of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.920 
within the region of about 40 grams of
protein<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.500> perfect<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.280> meal<00:01:23.930> Kluber

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

need<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.679> show<00:01:56.009> our<00:01:56.310> hard<00:01:57.060> boiled<00:01:57.390> eggs

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.889 

so<00:02:07.630> I'll<00:02:07.690> three<00:02:08.020> hardboard<00:02:08.770> eggs<00:02:09.130> now

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
so I'll three hardboard eggs now

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.750 
so I'll three hardboard eggs now
actually<00:02:10.899> remove<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> yolks<00:02:11.740> from<00:02:12.010> two<00:02:12.640> of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
actually remove the yolks from two of

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.090 
actually remove the yolks from two of
them<00:02:13.050> only<00:02:14.050> because<00:02:14.170> we're<00:02:14.500> getting<00:02:14.590> enough

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
them only because we're getting enough

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.890 
them only because we're getting enough
of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.460> fats<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.880> we<00:02:16.090> need<00:02:16.300> from<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
of the fats that we need from the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.890 
of the fats that we need from the
avocado<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.800> from<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.160> third<00:02:19.380> hole<00:02:20.380> deck

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
avocado and from that third hole deck

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.260 
avocado and from that third hole deck
but<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.959> know<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.170> your<00:02:23.320> main<00:02:23.620> goal<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.270> adding

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
but you know if your main goal is adding

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.230 
but you know if your main goal is adding
more<00:02:25.750> sighs<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.130> you're<00:02:27.310> not<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.760> worried

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
more sighs and you're not that worried

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.790 
more sighs and you're not that worried
about<00:02:28.330> keeping<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.110> super<00:02:29.290> lean<00:02:29.590> at<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
about keeping it super lean at the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.540 
about keeping it super lean at the
moment<00:02:30.130> keep<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> egg<00:02:31.270> yolks<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:32.550> good

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
moment keep the egg yolks in good

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.280 
moment keep the egg yolks in good
nutrition<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.330> I'm<00:02:34.480> certainly<00:02:34.810> add<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
nutrition and I'm certainly add the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.020 
nutrition and I'm certainly add the
calories<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.120> cut<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.390> one<00:02:37.540> open<00:02:39.030> okay

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
calories we just cut that one open okay

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
wheat now let's not to say there a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.590 
wheat now let's not to say there a
superior<00:04:21.889> form<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.310> carbohydrate<00:04:22.970> done<00:04:23.210> let's

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
superior form of carbohydrate done let's

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.469 
superior form of carbohydrate done let's
say<00:04:23.780> brown<00:04:24.020> rice<00:04:24.760> they<00:04:25.760> are<00:04:25.940> higher<00:04:26.240> glycemic
