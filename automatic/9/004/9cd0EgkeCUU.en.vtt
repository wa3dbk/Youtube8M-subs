 make a bag insa reeds quality 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.690
 first the drawing must be drawn 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.580
 then you have to choose but a little 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.350
 ass when i will be on the leather in fact 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.830
 there are several qualities of cure that must be 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.989
 to choose 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.850
 I'm working on the no because in 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.620
 done and I like the side the sweet side 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.720
 this is very sweet and it's more 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 suited to the woman's shopping and these 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.190
 resistant also then it takes them 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.859
 must choose the color I asked the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.840
 people actually to people I knew 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:35.660
 you think this model comes with 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.750
 the colors between them is good it's 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.040
 Red who won and who is 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.810
 before all this there are also 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.670
 accessories also that they are very very 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.140
 important actually because that's it 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.880
 closing that does not work is that we have 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.200
 the product that is devalued and that's it 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.060
 we can make customers because of that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.770
 once we have chosen for example we 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.420

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.920
