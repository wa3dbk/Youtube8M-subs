here's see how the engineer expertly

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.969 
here's see how the engineer expertly
guides<00:04:21.139> him<00:04:21.440> round<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.009> track<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:24.440> fact<00:04:24.830> it

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
guides him round the track in fact it

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.710 
guides him round the track in fact it
goes<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.280> fast<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.820> moves<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.240> platform

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
goes so fast it moves a platform

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.080 
goes so fast it moves a platform
occasionally<00:04:27.320> as<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.590> goes<00:04:27.710> past<00:04:27.850> but<00:04:28.850> don't

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
occasionally as it goes past but don't

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.990 
occasionally as it goes past but don't
worry<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.509> is<00:04:29.630> bupkis<00:04:30.139> and<00:04:30.530> safely<00:04:31.130> attached

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
worry it is bupkis and safely attached

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.810 
worry it is bupkis and safely attached
to<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.630> rails<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.100> won't<00:04:34.280> move<00:04:34.460> anywhere

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
to the rails so it won't move anywhere

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.999 
to the rails so it won't move anywhere
unless<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.210> whales<00:04:35.419> do<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.050> that's<00:04:36.740> quite
