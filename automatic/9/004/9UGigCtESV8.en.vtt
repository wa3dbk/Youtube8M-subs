 hello and welcome to this lapse 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.929
 sixth edition 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.880
 this week we have prepared you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 a special show since we 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.390
 dedicate a comparison of his 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.359
 applications to always stay at 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 does this now if the app 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.000
 to admit that it falls well 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.560
 finally these api replacement 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 advantageously google reader who 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 will disappear on July 1st 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 we remind you of it despite its 10 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.980
 millions of users 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:43.200
 thank you google number 6 news blur last 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
 of the comparative we criticize especially to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 this app not only to be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.230
 entirely in English but also its 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 presentation rather austere sources 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.829
 his agent is in a form of 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.660
 the iss within which we can just 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.230
 create folders not necessarily very 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.539
 convenient 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 another black dot you can not read 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.899
 offline articles ie 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 far from an internet connection you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.930
 can also use news butter in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.159
 a browser window that will make you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.020
 a very good rss feed reader 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 free it is available on iphone 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.400
 ipad and on android smartphone as 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 usually to download it you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.530
 Just scan the qr code that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.530
 appears on the screen 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 fifth of our class publishes news 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.770
 although in English also this 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.720
 application proves already now more 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.979
 intuitive to use that news blur 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.110
 basically because she is very 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.450
 graph by using it scrolling 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.189
 thumbnails photo horizontally this 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.829
 are your more news more allows us 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.420
 also to read his news offline 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.979
 that you can use it away from a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.689
 internet connection by cons you must 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.280
 download another one 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.460
 application for that you have the choice 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
 between a spa peppers readability pocket 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.920
 or evernote 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.899
 like most of its competitors 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 pulse news also has a website 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.409
 which you can use 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 the application from your computer 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.040
 however, it does not allow 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 recover google reader feeds 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.850
 this application is free it is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.649
 available on iphone ipad and on 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.110
 android smartphones by cons she has 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.799
 been removed from the windows phone store and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.799
 that's a shame 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.530
 number 4 of our ranking 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.360
 do you type this application displays a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.700
 interface that reminds one of pulse 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.260
 news with news feeds presented under 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.540
 form of thumbnail picture that is made 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.370
 scroll horizontally but there at least 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.930
 you can customize a minimum 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.640
 the interface by adjusting the size of 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.050
 son of actu or so by choosing the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.810
 color of the headbands that are above 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.489
 I have to say minimum a little 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.930
 originality all the same the sites 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.209
 info to which you can subscribe 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 are grouped in a stream store a 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.260
 kind of news store pretty well 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.880
 busy tape you also has a 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.620
 website unfortunately it's a bit 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.410
 clutter and not very well translated into 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.019
 french available on iphone / ipad 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.780
 on android you could stand out in 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.980
 being also available on blackberry and that 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.510
 it's really good here we are 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.459
 at the foot of the podium with number 3 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.290
 google feed attention it's not about 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.299
 from the official google reader 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.330
 however this app stands out with 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.010
 a sober and very successful interface 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.530
 is both enjoyable to watch 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.609
 nice to use finally once 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.859
 has retained the main principles 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.299
 because google was proposed two ways to 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.220
 browse the news flows either in 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.319
 browsing techno science topics 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.150
 sports entertainment or so in 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.660
 flicking his foot a bit like a 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.940
 magazine 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.650
 the effect is very successful another 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.209
 advantage of google was and that justifies 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.209
 largely this third place 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.549
 it's his ability to translate 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.470
 foreign language articles in French 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.209
 note that there is no version 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.560
 google web feed that does not offer 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.239
 not to recover the fluids 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.940
 current google reader again 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.739
 thank you google google was good 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.690
 obviously free on smartphone 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.709
 android it goes without saying but also on 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.709
 iphone and ipad 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.060
 number of our clan feedly this 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.280
 application sets the bar very very 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.440
 high in terms of design and ergonomics 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.270
 it flips through like a notebook of 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.350
 up and down from the bottom up and you 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.730
 go to the different sections 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.960
 thematic a boost to the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.090
 right and to all sources of information 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.920
 a boost in the left mistrust 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.390
 de li is also distinguished with its 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.160
 many options that allow by 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.290
 example of customizing the way of 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.910
 pilot application to change the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.250
 background color to adjust the size of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.989
 characters or to predefine 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.060
 recipients for the news you want 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.520
 to follow by email and that's very 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.500
 practice and unlike google stream 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.820
 feedly makes it possible to recover the 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.980
 google reader fluids 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.360
 in the end we just regret that feedly 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.430
 so all in English and it can 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.470
 not recovered the threads of facebook news or 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.470
 free twitter it is available on 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.420
 iphone / ipad and on android as well as 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.010
 as an application for the 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.780
 Chrome browser number one of our 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.350
 comparative first step of the podium 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.790
 for flipboard good it is necessary that the net that 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.130
 played a hair with philippe 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.660
 nevertheless flipboard is doing even better 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.400
 that phil lee in terms of design with 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.919
 photos that are really in the spotlight 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.620
 often in full screen and effects of 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.000
 very aesthetic scrolling way rolodex 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.320
 rolodex you know the good old 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.600
 poster binder that revolves around a 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.890
 cylinder 1,2 strong point of flipboard itself 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.210
 are all the social networks to which 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.690
 the application is able to 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.120
 log on 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.350

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.280
 more specifically to some 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.960
 twitter users to pages or 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.120

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.520
 period
