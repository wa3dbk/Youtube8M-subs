00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
here somewhere what we're gonna do is a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.170 
here somewhere what we're gonna do is a
footing<00:01:36.890> it'll<00:01:37.040> be<00:01:37.100> about<00:01:37.250> four<00:01:37.610> hundred<00:01:37.820> mill

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
footing it'll be about four hundred mill

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.170 
footing it'll be about four hundred mill
wide<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.870> about<00:01:39.170> 300<00:01:40.040> mill<00:01:40.190> deep<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:41.000> pretty

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
wide and about 300 mill deep it pretty

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.000 
wide and about 300 mill deep it pretty
much<00:01:41.330> works<00:01:41.570> like<00:01:41.780> an<00:01:41.930> anchor<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.650> bigger<00:01:42.890> the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
much works like an anchor the bigger the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.890 
much works like an anchor the bigger the
boat<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.550> bigger<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.970> anchor<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.540> bigger

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
boat the bigger the anchor the bigger

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.840 
boat the bigger the anchor the bigger
the<00:01:44.990> wall<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.530> bigger<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.890> footing<00:01:46.190> now<00:01:48.850> I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the wall the bigger the footing now I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.400 
the wall the bigger the footing now I
can<00:01:50.000> actually<00:01:50.120> feel<00:01:50.480> this<00:01:50.690> whole<00:01:50.900> space<00:01:51.170> with

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
can actually feel this whole space with

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.990 
can actually feel this whole space with
concrete<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:51.980> it's<00:01:52.100> just<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.400> waste<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.730> money

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
concrete but it's just a waste of money

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.910 
concrete but it's just a waste of money
got<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> couple<00:01:53.690> old<00:01:53.870> sleepers<00:01:54.380> here<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.710> don't

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
got a couple old sleepers here I don't

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.560 
got a couple old sleepers here I don't
care<00:01:55.190> whether<00:01:55.400> I<00:01:55.550> cover<00:01:55.850> them<00:01:56.000> up<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.390> lose

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
care whether I cover them up and lose

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.510 
care whether I cover them up and lose
them<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.470> least<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.920> gives<00:01:58.040> me<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.250> height

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
them but at least it gives me a height

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.510 
them but at least it gives me a height
to<00:01:58.700> set<00:01:58.910> too

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.640 

now<00:02:04.520> we're<00:02:04.700> using<00:02:04.930> 1.2<00:02:05.930> meters<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.470> concrete

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
now we're using 1.2 meters of concrete

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.920 
now we're using 1.2 meters of concrete
if<00:02:07.190> it's<00:02:07.400> more<00:02:07.610> than<00:02:07.730> that<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:08.479> trouble

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
if it's more than that we're in trouble

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.430 
if it's more than that we're in trouble
it<00:02:09.650> costs<00:02:09.979> us<00:02:10.100> 460<00:02:10.850> bucks<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:12.080> smaller

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
it costs us 460 bucks the smaller

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.870 
it costs us 460 bucks the smaller
amounts<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.980> concrete<00:02:13.190> are<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.550> little<00:02:13.730> bit

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
amounts of concrete are a little bit

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.940 
amounts of concrete are a little bit
more<00:02:13.910> expensive<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.870> when<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.530> compare<00:02:15.710> it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
more expensive but when you compare it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.740 
more expensive but when you compare it
and<00:02:16.040> knocking<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.340> up<00:02:16.460> yourself<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.510> worth

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
and knocking it up yourself it's worth

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.520 
and knocking it up yourself it's worth
it<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:20.270> I'm<00:02:20.390> doing<00:02:20.630> here<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.900> laying<00:02:21.350> them

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
it what I'm doing here is laying them

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.840 
it what I'm doing here is laying them
out<00:02:21.590> dry<00:02:21.830> I'll<00:02:22.010> lift<00:02:22.190> them<00:02:22.340> out<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> minute

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
out dry I'll lift them out in a minute

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.630 
out dry I'll lift them out in a minute
but<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.360> finding<00:02:23.840> all<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.200> whole<00:02:24.410> spaces<00:02:25.010> so

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
but I'm finding all the whole spaces so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.550 
but I'm finding all the whole spaces so
in<00:02:25.760> every<00:02:26.000> second<00:02:26.390> one<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:27.050> spear<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:27.470> of

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
in every second one I can spear one of

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.370 
in every second one I can spear one of
these<00:02:27.680> riyo<00:02:27.920> rods<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.940> that'll<00:02:29.840> tie<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.050> wall

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
these riyo rods and that'll tie the wall

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.140 
these riyo rods and that'll tie the wall
into<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.980> footing<00:02:31.310> making<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.700> whole<00:02:31.880> thing

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
into the footing making the whole thing

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.570 
into the footing making the whole thing
nice<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.290> strong<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:37.100> it's<00:02:37.280> really

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
nice and strong now it's really

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.460 
nice and strong now it's really
important<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.270> think<00:02:38.300> safe<00:02:38.780> even<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
important to think safe even in the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.840 
important to think safe even in the
backyard<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.100> important<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.550> put<00:02:40.670> these

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
backyard it's important to put these

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.180 
backyard it's important to put these
yellow<00:02:41.150> caps<00:02:41.450> on<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:42.170> don't<00:02:42.410> want<00:02:42.590> anyone<00:02:42.890> for

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
yellow caps on you don't want anyone for

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.920 
yellow caps on you don't want anyone for
one<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.700> these<00:02:43.790> rods<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> sticking<00:02:44.750> out<00:02:44.840> of

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
one of these rods as a sticking out of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.390 
one of these rods as a sticking out of
the<00:02:44.990> ground<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.770> that's<00:02:46.040> especially

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
the ground and that's especially

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.100 
the ground and that's especially
important<00:02:47.240> because<00:02:47.270> we<00:02:47.600> have<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.840> leave<00:02:47.990> it

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
important because we have to leave it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.520 
important because we have to leave it
overnight

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
overnight

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.470 
overnight
so<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> concrete<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.490> dry<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.970> another<00:02:53.180> day

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so the concrete can dry it's another day

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.910 
so the concrete can dry it's another day
and<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.050> another<00:02:54.290> dollar<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:54.800> it's

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and it's another dollar but it's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.770 
and it's another dollar but it's
exciting<00:02:55.280> stuff<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:55.880> get<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> build<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.510> wall

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
exciting stuff we get to build the wall

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.720 
exciting stuff we get to build the wall
first<00:02:57.380> thing<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.680> need<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.860> do<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.280> set<00:02:58.580> out

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
first thing you need to do is set out

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.190 
first thing you need to do is set out
the<00:02:58.880> ends<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.300> make<00:02:59.390> sure<00:02:59.570> our<00:02:59.720> blocks<00:02:59.990> fit

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
the ends and make sure our blocks fit

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.600 
the ends and make sure our blocks fit
but<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.740> rods<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.130> put<00:03:01.310> in<00:03:01.430> yesterday

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
but the rods that I put in yesterday

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.810 
but the rods that I put in yesterday
will<00:03:02.030> help<00:03:02.240> us<00:03:02.330> through<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:03.520> when<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.610> send

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
will help us through that when you send

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.340 
will help us through that when you send
up<00:03:04.940> string<00:03:05.240> line<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.720> important<00:03:06.320> that

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
up string line it's important that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.020 
up string line it's important that
you're<00:03:06.530> as<00:03:06.620> accurate<00:03:07.160> as<00:03:07.250> possible<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.790> block

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you're as accurate as possible the block

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.760 
you're as accurate as possible the block
gets<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.510> spin<00:03:08.720> roughly<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.320> right<00:03:09.470> spot

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
gets to spin roughly in the right spot

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.320 
gets to spin roughly in the right spot
but<00:03:09.800> as<00:03:10.010> you're<00:03:10.130> working<00:03:10.520> you're<00:03:10.940> gonna<00:03:11.090> knock

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
but as you're working you're gonna knock

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.820 
but as you're working you're gonna knock
it<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.600> bang<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.440> got<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.590> piece<00:03:12.800> of

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
it and bang it I just got a piece of

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.830 
it and bang it I just got a piece of
paper<00:03:13.040> off<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.489> bag<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.270> cements<00:03:14.720> in

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
paper off the bag that the cements in

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.960 
paper off the bag that the cements in
and<00:03:15.170> then<00:03:15.680> I'll<00:03:16.070> weigh<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.550> deal<00:03:16.790> with<00:03:16.940> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
and then I'll weigh that deal with a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.380 
and then I'll weigh that deal with a
brick<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.510> now<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.230> can't<00:03:18.530> live

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
brick and now it can't live

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.270 
brick and now it can't live
you<00:03:20.750> notice<00:03:21.110> I'm<00:03:21.260> laying<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.680> block<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.160> they

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
you notice I'm laying the block so they

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.010 
you notice I'm laying the block so they
don't<00:03:22.490> sit<00:03:22.700> directly<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.300> top<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.540> each<00:03:23.750> other

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
don't sit directly on top of each other

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.350 
don't sit directly on top of each other
this<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.620> called<00:03:24.980> stretcher<00:03:25.370> bond<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.000> it's<00:03:26.270> a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
this is called stretcher bond and it's a

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.470 
this is called stretcher bond and it's a
lot<00:03:26.630> stronger

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.540 

now<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:31.629> is<00:03:31.750> called<00:03:32.050> core<00:03:32.440> filling<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.459> I'm

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
now this is called core filling but I'm

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.009 
now this is called core filling but I'm
doing<00:03:33.790> every<00:03:34.000> second<00:03:34.360> peer<00:03:34.510> because<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.840> only

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
doing every second peer because I only

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.410 
doing every second peer because I only
put<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.349> REO<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.860> every<00:03:36.069> second<00:03:36.400> Pete<00:03:36.550> over

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
put the REO in every second Pete over

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.330 
put the REO in every second Pete over
the<00:03:37.629> top<00:03:37.870> I'm<00:03:38.170> gonna<00:03:38.379> lay<00:03:38.590> some<00:03:38.620> capping<00:03:39.190> so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
the top I'm gonna lay some capping so

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.070 
the top I'm gonna lay some capping so
you<00:03:39.400> won't<00:03:39.670> see<00:03:39.910> any<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> goings-on<00:03:40.750> or

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
you won't see any of the goings-on or

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.400 
you won't see any of the goings-on or
the<00:03:41.170> workings<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.769> wall<00:03:42.959> say<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.019> keep<00:03:44.260> as

leveled off an area and I found that we

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.220 
leveled off an area and I found that we
need<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.430> small<00:03:57.760> step<00:03:58.030> here<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.690> reason<00:03:59.110> why
