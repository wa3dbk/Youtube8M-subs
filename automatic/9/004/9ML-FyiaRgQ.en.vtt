00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.830 

hi<00:00:01.410> there<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.890> skin<00:00:02.340> we<00:00:03.179> have<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> very

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hi there this is skin we have a very

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi there this is skin we have a very
simple<00:00:04.319> problem<00:00:05.359> the<00:00:06.359> density<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.020> water

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
simple problem the density of water

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.610 
simple problem the density of water
which<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:08.280> gram<00:00:08.610> per<00:00:08.880> cubic<00:00:09.179> centimeter

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
which is one gram per cubic centimeter

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
which is one gram per cubic centimeter
is<00:00:11.330> converted<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.590> units<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.889> kilogram<00:00:14.809> per

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is converted to units in kilogram per

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
is converted to units in kilogram per
cubic<00:00:16.130> kill<00:00:17.130> me

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
cubic kill me

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.880 
cubic kill me
and<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.880> use<00:00:21.529> we<00:00:22.529> need<00:00:22.590> just

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and so we need just to use we need just

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.269 
and so we need just to use we need just
to<00:00:22.980> relate<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.910> units<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.710> another<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
to relate the units to one another and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.339 
to relate the units to one another and
we<00:00:26.460> find<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.910> conversion<00:00:27.359> factor<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.080> we've

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
we find a conversion factor that we've

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.780 
we find a conversion factor that we've
suited<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.439> from<00:00:31.439> grams<00:00:31.769> occur<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.579> know

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
suited so from grams occur and we know

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.209 
suited so from grams occur and we know
that<00:00:33.059> 1<00:00:33.450> kilogram<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> equal<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:35.809> 1000<00:00:36.809> grams

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
that 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.440 
that 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams
and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.969> also<00:00:39.149> know<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.219> one<00:00:41.450> kill-kill

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and then we also know that one kill-kill

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.500 
and then we also know that one kill-kill
Amir<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.140> equal<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.600> 1000<00:00:45.600> meters<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:48.360> also

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Amir is equal to 1000 meters and we also

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.430 
Amir is equal to 1000 meters and we also
know<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> 1<00:00:49.620> meter<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.309> equal<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.440> 100

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
know that 1 meter is equal to 100

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.350 
know that 1 meter is equal to 100
centimeter<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.690> we'll<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.899> using<00:00:55.110> these

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
centimeter and we'll be using these

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
centimeter and we'll be using these
these<00:00:57.360> conversion<00:00:58.050> factors<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.649> our<00:00:58.770> solution

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
these conversion factors in our solution

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.689 
these conversion factors in our solution
will<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> remember<00:01:02.370> if

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
will go like and we need to remember if

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
will go like and we need to remember if
we<00:01:02.879> only<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.329> significant<00:01:04.199> figure

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
we only have one significant figure

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.420 
we only have one significant figure
later<00:01:04.939> one<00:01:05.939> gram<00:01:08.060> cubic<00:01:09.060> centimeter

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
later one gram cubic centimeter

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.690 
later one gram cubic centimeter
multiplied<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.490> by<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.820> conversion<00:01:12.450> factor

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
multiplied it by a conversion factor

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.700 
multiplied it by a conversion factor
first<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:17.070> convert<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
first that is in we convert it to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.789 
first that is in we convert it to
kilograms<00:01:20.689> one<00:01:21.689> thousand<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
kilograms one thousand in the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.270 
kilograms one thousand in the
denominator<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.860> cubic

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
denominator then for the cubic

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.780 
denominator then for the cubic
centimeter<00:01:27.650> we<00:01:28.650> use<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> strategy

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
centimeter we use this kind of strategy

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
centimeter we use this kind of strategy
there<00:01:34.939> from<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.960> killer<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.290> 1,000

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
there from one killer we have 1,000

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.100 
there from one killer we have 1,000
liters<00:01:41.240> then<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> need<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> keep<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.579> then

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
liters then you need to keep that then

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.899 
liters then you need to keep that then
from<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.810> cubic<00:01:48.810> meter<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.470> 1<00:01:50.310> meter<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
from the cubic meter we have 1 meter and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
from the cubic meter we have 1 meter and
then<00:01:51.979> 100<00:01:53.390> centimeter<00:01:54.439> then<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> need<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
then 100 centimeter then you need to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.459 
then 100 centimeter then you need to
cube<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.969> can't<00:01:57.270> perform<00:01:57.509> operations

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
cube because we can't perform operations

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.300 
cube because we can't perform operations
they<00:01:58.890> are<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> same<00:01:59.549> games<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:02.130> would

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
they are not the same games so we would

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.460 
they are not the same games so we would
get<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.820> 1<00:02:03.450> gram<00:02:05.210> cmq

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
get a 1 gram cmq

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.870 
get a 1 gram cmq
then<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.759> one's<00:02:09.200> stated<00:02:10.200> saying<00:02:10.880> one

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
then this one's stated saying one

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.200 
then this one's stated saying one
kilogram<00:02:12.360> over<00:02:12.980> 1,000<00:02:13.980> grams<00:02:15.680> then<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:17.790> one

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
kilogram over 1,000 grams then this one

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.070 
kilogram over 1,000 grams then this one
would<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.020> be<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.920> thousand<00:02:20.520> two<00:02:21.080> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
would have to be one thousand two the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.450 
would have to be one thousand two the
unit<00:02:22.440> also<00:02:23.400> killed<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:25.140> that's<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
unit also killed and one that's just the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:37.130 
unit also killed and one that's just the
same<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.230> telemeter<00:02:28.940> skew<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:36.140> one

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
same then telemeter skew then here one

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.120 
same then telemeter skew then here one
hundred<00:02:37.350> would<00:02:37.770> also<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.340> killed<00:02:39.890> that's<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
hundred would also be killed that's a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.640 
hundred would also be killed that's a
cube<00:02:41.490> hence<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.480> units<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.110> centimeter

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
cube hence the units for centimeter

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.280 
cube hence the units for centimeter
would<00:02:43.920> also<00:02:44.190> end<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.700> give<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.959> cubes

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
would also end to give you one cubes

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.710 
would also end to give you one cubes
just<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.880> neighbor<00:02:48.120> would<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.570> to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
just one then the neighbor would have to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.040 
just one then the neighbor would have to
cook<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.490> now<00:02:50.610> cancel<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.750> units

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
cook you so we can now cancel the units

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.600 
cook you so we can now cancel the units
then<00:02:52.590> cancel<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:57.200> if<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.860> cancel<00:02:59.130> now

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
then cancel then if we can cancel now

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.390 
then cancel then if we can cancel now
neither<00:03:00.230> okay<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.520> also<00:03:03.080> cubic<00:03:04.400> centimeters

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
neither okay and also cubic centimeters

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.420 
neither okay and also cubic centimeters
so<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.480> would<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:07.080> left<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.440> kill

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
so that you would be left with kill

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.840 
so that you would be left with kill
meter<00:03:08.730> cubed<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.290> so<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.709> we<00:03:11.040> would<00:03:11.280> arrive

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
meter cubed in so that we would arrive

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.199 
meter cubed in so that we would arrive
at<00:03:12.030> our<00:03:12.150> goal<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:13.019> then<00:03:13.230> doing<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.769> math<00:03:14.209> we

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
at our goal and then doing the math we

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.770 
at our goal and then doing the math we
get<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:16.019> times<00:03:17.450> ten<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.680> twelve
