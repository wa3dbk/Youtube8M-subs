this<00:00:24.840> game<00:00:25.080> before<00:00:25.699> but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.000> doubt<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.779> very

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this game before but I doubt that very

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
this game before but I doubt that very
very<00:00:28.769> very<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:30.029> much<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.250> he

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
very very very much what I think is he

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.680 
very very very much what I think is he
got<00:00:33.750> busted<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.350> boosting<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:36.210> he<00:00:36.480> made

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
got busted for boosting and then he made

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.110 
got busted for boosting and then he made
damn<00:00:37.079> sure<00:00:37.110> his<00:00:38.070> buddy<00:00:38.309> could<00:00:38.520> win<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> game

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
damn sure his buddy could win the game
