00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey and welcome here at kicker.de 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.379
 today the 700 euro graphics and video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 processing pc as a processor of intel 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.950
 xeon e3 12.30 v3 with a basic clocking 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.870
 of 33 gigahertz a rate of 3.7 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 ghz at four cores and eight threads 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.080
 offers these processes a very good one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 performance for demanding 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 video editing as of course also for 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.990
 current games by the current 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 ruling procedure of 22 nanometers 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.760
 will have a low tdp of 80 watts 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.830
 reaches 1 8 megabyte large l3 cache 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.540
 legally also on an intel 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.440
 hd graphics unit you have to, however 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.180
 renounce 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 this cpu will be in the box version 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.230
 that is a cooler is delivered with 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 here as a working memory come here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.730
 Two modules of this are for use 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.309
 with a total of 8 GB of storage capacity 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.500
 a speed of 1,600 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 megahertz and the cl new latency times 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.090
 offers the aris series of muscle more 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.530
 as enough memory performance the eight 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 gigabyte kit consisting of two 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 Memory modules enable a dual 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.320
 channel operation for optimal 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.180
 Connection through the low memory 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 height can also be larger processor cooler 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 be easily installed processor as 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 also memory takes up space 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.790
 a us rock b 85 m per 4 mainboard 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 this motherboard is equipped with 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.509
 the 11 50 o'clock socke for the interviews 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 and offers the possibility of up to 32 gb 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.430
 Memory in dual channel operation 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.170
 to obstruct 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 for current graphics cards are available for this purpose 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 two pci express connectors to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 one of these offers the pci 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.950
 Although express 3.0 standard offers us that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.790
 rock b 85 m per 4 mainboard o2 ps 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.439
 express connections 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 but this is only one 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.979
 crossfirex system is going on by ass ee 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.619
 unsupported 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.259
 for hard drives co, the pro 4 offers 6 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.840
 sata connections are two with sata 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.579
 3 so sata 6 gb / s and of course 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.560
 This mainboard offers us a lot 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.570
 peripheral connections including to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.719
 example 4 x usb 2.0 2 x usb 3.0 vga dvi 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.030
 hdmi lan and of course hd audio 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.259
 motherboards need graphic cards co 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.360
 of course, a corresponding one 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.060
 housing and this could be the pay set 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.989
 a plus to use 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.399
 this atx midi tower offers 4 x usb 2.0 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.140
 Microphone and headphone jack at the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.840
 front and a 2-channel fan control 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.610
 with temperature sensors and built-in 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 display processor cooler with one 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.290
 maximum height of 16 9 cm and 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.620
 graphics cards with a length of up to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.510
 29 cm fit easily into the z 9 plus 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.069
 of course, the number-man pure 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.630
 housing magical max thing and therefore 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.050
 you can also choose another one 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.239
 as grafik accelerator comes the gtx 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.100
 750 ti from home eg for use 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.560
 equipped with 2 gb 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.910
 graphics memory and the atx cooler with 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.340
 a basic clock of 1189 mega 128 bit 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.340
 memory interface as well as the directx 11 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.530
 support in the area are 1 x dvi once 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.510
 hdmi and a displayport connection for 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.299
 monitor and co available 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.400
 power supply a be quiet system power7 with 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.349
 400 watts this offers an 80 plus 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.390
 bronze certification thus one 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.670
 efficiency of up to 86 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.920
 So the whole thing is also energy efficient 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.170
 and a quiet 120 millimeter fan 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.690
 on a modular cable construction must 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.060
 Unfortunately one waives 400 watts are also 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.680
 Here again completely sufficient for 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.329
 sufficient space ensures the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.040
 seagate barracuda with a terabyte 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.590
 storage capacity with one 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.530
 speed of 7200 revolutions per 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.750
 minute a 64 mb cache as well 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.040
 the hall 600 connection is this 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.630
 hard disk not only fast but 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.290
 also pleasantly quiet 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.630
 the samsung 840 evo 120 gb solid state 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.680
 disk serves as disk for windows 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.900
 and programs with one 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.190
 reading speed of over 500 mb per 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.100
 second and a writing speed 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.170
 of over 400 mb per second , the 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.209
 wait of programs and co 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.829
 significantly shortened data benefit in 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.720
 usually not from a ssd and 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.910
 should therefore preferably on one 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.680
 be stored on a classic hard drive 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.850
 as an optical drive comes a lg 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.889
 burner for use 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.440
 this reads and burns everything with cd 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.299
 Unfortunately , blu rays does not do that and dvd 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.560
 that is what it should have been, thank you 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.780
 I would watch myself over 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.430
 a positive rating as well as an abo 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.970
 rejoice from you and then to the next 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.269
 times 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.269
 pure skin
