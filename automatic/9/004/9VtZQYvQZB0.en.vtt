everybody's seen all the different
Altoid<00:00:11.160> projects<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.179> there<00:00:12.420> and

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
Altoid projects that are out there and

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.890 
Altoid projects that are out there and
what<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.429> here<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.480> outside

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
what we have here is this is the outside

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.290 
what we have here is this is the outside
small<00:00:16.350> case<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.010> wanted<00:00:17.789> something<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.119> was<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
small case I wanted something that was a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.480 
small case I wanted something that was a
little<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:18.690> versatile<00:00:19.289> than<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.310> outdoor

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
little more versatile than the outdoor

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580 
little more versatile than the outdoor
charger<00:00:21.390> basically<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> needed<00:00:22.320> something

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
charger basically I needed something

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
charger basically I needed something
that<00:00:22.859> would<00:00:22.980> take<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.519> variety<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.300> different

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
that would take a variety of different

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.640 
that would take a variety of different
input<00:00:25.109> sources<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.539> voltages<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> then

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
input sources and voltages and then

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.099 
input sources and voltages and then
convert<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> nice<00:00:29.970> smooth<00:00:30.420> 5<00:00:30.840> volt

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
convert that out to a nice smooth 5 volt

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.979 
convert that out to a nice smooth 5 volt
supply<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.420> electronics

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
supply so I'm not an electronics

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.299 
supply so I'm not an electronics
engineer<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.440> didn't<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.010> through<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
engineer I didn't want to go through the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.220 
engineer I didn't want to go through the
hassle<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.790> trying<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.660> own<00:00:36.690> circuit

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
hassle of trying to make my own circuit

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.560 
hassle of trying to make my own circuit
and<00:00:37.320> everything<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.270> let's<00:00:39.270> search<00:00:39.540> for

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and everything so let's search for

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
and everything so let's search for
something<00:00:40.079> different<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
something different and this is what I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.100 
something different and this is what I
came<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:43.320> start<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
came up with so we start with just a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.639 
came up with so we start with just a
this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> verizon<00:00:46.950> car<00:00:47.850> charger<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.649> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this is a verizon car charger for a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
this is a verizon car charger for a
Motorola<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.520> Blackberry<00:00:51.090> something<00:00:51.570> like

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Motorola or Blackberry something like

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
Motorola or Blackberry something like
that<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> standard<00:00:52.620> mini<00:00:52.770> USB<00:00:53.010> cable

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that it's got a standard mini USB cable

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
that it's got a standard mini USB cable
on<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.140> nice<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.350> about<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
on it and the nice thing about this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.170 
on it and the nice thing about this
little<00:00:56.129> charger<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> great

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
little charger is it's got a great

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.619 
little charger is it's got a great
little<00:00:57.420> circuit<00:00:57.750> built<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.440> takes

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
little circuit built into it that takes

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.189 
little circuit built into it that takes
you<00:01:00.629> know<00:01:00.750> 12<00:01:01.020> 13<00:01:01.109> volts<00:01:02.010> DC<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.199> then

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you know 12 13 volts DC and then

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.969 
you know 12 13 volts DC and then
converts<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.180> steps<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.380> 5<00:01:07.650> volts

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
converts that steps that down to 5 volts

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550 
converts that steps that down to 5 volts
DC<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.580> come<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.090> end<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.110> went

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
DC to come out the other end so I went

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.899 
DC to come out the other end so I went
on<00:01:10.650> ahead<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.010> took<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> spare<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.790> these

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
on ahead and took a spare one of these

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.929 
on ahead and took a spare one of these
that<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.180> had<00:01:12.390> laying<00:01:12.570> around<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.729> chopped<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that I had laying around and chopped it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.520 
that I had laying around and chopped it
all<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.770> pulled<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> guts<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
all up and pulled the guts out of it and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.920 
all up and pulled the guts out of it and
basically<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.130> end<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.300 

great<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> circuit<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:26.159> in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
great little circuit that you see in

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
great little circuit that you see in
there<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.540> small<00:01:28.320> little

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
there it's just the the small little

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
there it's just the the small little
circuit<00:01:28.979> board<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.729> wanted<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> adapt<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
circuit board so I wanted to adapt that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
circuit board so I wanted to adapt that
in<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.350> smaller<00:01:31.770> package<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.909> just

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
in a little bit smaller package we just

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.350 
in a little bit smaller package we just
take<00:01:33.560> took<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> chopped<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.189> an<00:01:35.340> old<00:01:35.460> USB<00:01:36.060> hub

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
take took and chopped up an old USB hub

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.640 
take took and chopped up an old USB hub
and<00:01:36.860> pulled<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:39.090> USB<00:01:39.689> port<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and pulled the the USB port out of it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.120 
and pulled the the USB port out of it
and<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.549> Deans<00:01:41.790> connector<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.560> lot

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and a Deans connector and also do a lot

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.679 
and a Deans connector and also do a lot
of<00:01:44.159> RC<00:01:44.640> modeling<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.270> had<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> bunch<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of RC modeling so I had a bunch of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.020 
of RC modeling so I had a bunch of
Dean's<00:01:45.899> connectors<00:01:46.380> laying<00:01:46.619> around<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.610> just

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
Dean's connectors laying around so just

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.310 
Dean's connectors laying around so just
connected<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:50.149> hot<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> ground<00:01:51.869> wires<00:01:52.110> from

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
connected the hot and ground wires from

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.249 
connected the hot and ground wires from
the<00:01:52.409> deans<00:01:52.619> connector<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:56.060> input<00:01:57.060> side<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the deans connector to the input side of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.940 
the deans connector to the input side of
the<00:01:58.409> wafer<00:01:58.560> board<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.939> USB<00:02:00.710> plug<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the wafer board and then the USB plug to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
the wafer board and then the USB plug to
the<00:02:02.070> output<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.869> allows<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the output side and what this allows you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.550

quite<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.359> bit<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.079> on<00:03:31.410> voltages<00:03:32.010> I've<00:03:32.579> used<00:03:32.880> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
quite a bit so on voltages I've used it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.150 
quite a bit so on voltages I've used it
with<00:03:33.090> everything<00:03:34.079> from<00:03:34.230> four<00:03:34.500> doublea's<00:03:34.920> all
