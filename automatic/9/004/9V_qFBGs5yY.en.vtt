00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
right now it appears to be under water

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160 
right now it appears to be under water
because<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> end<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.049> winter

there but you know all this talk of
salts<00:01:50.580> making<00:01:50.880> me<00:01:50.970> hungry<00:01:51.270> let's<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.689> cook

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
salts making me hungry let's go cook

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.830 
salts making me hungry let's go cook
something<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:53.580> today<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> thought<00:01:53.970> I'd<00:01:54.270> try<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
something so today I thought I'd try and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.180 
something so today I thought I'd try and
develop<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.229> little<00:01:55.440> bit<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.680> recipe<00:01:56.039> on<00:01:56.159> my

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
own the ingredients are going to be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.010 
own the ingredients are going to be
similar<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.610> Steak<00:02:00.210> Diane<00:02:00.240> as

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

similar to that of the Steak Diane as
far<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> state<00:02:01.680> goes<00:02:02.539> minus<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.659> cream

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
far as the state goes minus the cream

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
little bit of design mustard for just a

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.240 
little bit of design mustard for just a
little<00:04:40.910> bit<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.300> heat<00:04:42.400> our<00:04:43.400> cake<00:04:43.670> is<00:04:43.700> done<00:04:44.200> and

little bit of heat our cake is done and

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.240 
little bit of heat our cake is done and
so<00:04:46.250> there<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.520> have<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:47.920> well<00:04:48.920> once<00:04:49.130> again

that<00:05:18.860> simmer<00:05:19.130> down<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.400> reduced<00:05:19.760> down<00:05:19.970> to

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
that simmer down and reduced down to

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240 
that simmer down and reduced down to
almost<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.660> sauce<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.170> that<00:05:21.290> was<00:05:21.410> really<00:05:22.100> good

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
almost a sauce and that was really good

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.570 
almost a sauce and that was really good
and<00:05:22.660> three<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.690> added<00:05:24.080> little<00:05:24.230> sesame<00:05:24.680> oil<00:05:24.920> now

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.180 
and three I added little sesame oil now
i<00:05:25.910> don't<00:05:26.900> think<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.260> sesame<00:05:27.620> all<00:05:27.740> worked<00:05:28.040> out

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
i don't think the sesame all worked out

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.430 
i don't think the sesame all worked out
that<00:05:28.430> well<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.790> it<00:05:29.750> didn't<00:05:30.080> take<00:05:30.200> anything

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
that well it it didn't take anything

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.170 
that well it it didn't take anything
away<00:05:30.740> from<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.100> flavor<00:05:31.430> i<00:05:31.580> didn't<00:05:31.880> really

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
away from the flavor i didn't really

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.660 
away from the flavor i didn't really
taste<00:05:32.480> it<00:05:32.690> in<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.840> meat<00:05:33.100> but<00:05:34.100> what<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.340> did<00:05:34.520> do

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
taste it in the meat but what it did do

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:41.520 
taste it in the meat but what it did do
is<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:34.940> made<00:05:35.120> my<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:36.050> think<00:05:36.830> sesame<00:05:37.250> oil<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:38.440> I

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.040 

think<00:05:42.530> sesame<00:05:43.010> oil<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.580> olive<00:05:44.420> oil<00:05:44.930> have

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
think sesame oil and olive oil have

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.510 
think sesame oil and olive oil have
different<00:05:45.410> boiling<00:05:45.590> points<00:05:45.770> so<00:05:46.220> there<00:05:46.370> was<00:05:46.460> a

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
different boiling points so there was a

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.950 
different boiling points so there was a
lot<00:05:46.580> of<00:05:46.670> popping<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.180> cracking<00:05:47.480> going<00:05:47.630> on<00:05:47.780> it

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
lot of popping and cracking going on it

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.020 
lot of popping and cracking going on it
really<00:05:48.170> made<00:05:48.320> quite<00:05:48.530> a<00:05:48.590> mess<00:05:48.800> so<00:05:49.100> next<00:05:49.850> time

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
really made quite a mess so next time

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.840 
really made quite a mess so next time
we'll<00:05:50.240> leave<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.390> out<00:05:50.720> as<00:05:50.900> well<00:05:51.070> so<00:05:52.070> until

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
we'll leave that out as well so until

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.810 
we'll leave that out as well so until
next<00:05:52.880> time<00:05:53.300> Bon<00:05:54.290> Appetit

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
next time Bon Appetit
