00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.350
 the program was recorded by 2 to 1 I am a reference 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.760
 what happened 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.900
 what we presented expansion is luiz and players both run behind 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.759
 of this 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.049
 then it is normal that he retired in the Brazilian championship a championship 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.340
 difficult a championship that the team has to be tricky third singers 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.230
 experienced and even regenerates 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.960
 We suffer from this. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.390
 This is not the first time that Flemish happens 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.179
 this should happen today is a topic that amount is a long time ago 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.659
 a good time 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.129
 if you stop the championship of 2007 and 2008 we hardly started the championship 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.410
 with the team ended with another 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.880
 so it's difficult the championship is difficult we have to have balance 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.990
 at this moment of the championship 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.210
 that he has a lot of attention 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 are the schools that do not have this tension is lucky 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.300
 are hector keep quiet at that time 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 I do not know how to solve this question, maybe some kind of videos in the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.750
 moment of calculation or cruise 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.200
 he scored the second goal the ball went through everyone and we can only leave us 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 the loose ball considered the largest of the last 50 years 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.650
 and worse an interpellation of pcp rita mouse 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.280
 giving an interpretation be vetoed from the game 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 in response to boos 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.060
 it was not 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 already answered this question 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230
 I think that he 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.320
 is the fan will never understand this at the time the team lost 2 to 1 with 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.250
 of the game 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.820
 anyway 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.800
 jumped to the fan that explanation one defeats the sector 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.030
 what result 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.800
 How do we want it too? 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.130
 but nothing now however such a critical way we think 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.520
 I think the idea is to hold 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.430
 the game - right away because if this season anyhow 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.660
 if a more serious error occurs with the boy dci 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.200
 Never played in Flemish again 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 and you know how it is that it is difficult to play in Flemish 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.030
 play in Flemish but play against the club 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.340
 and I respect that nation respect this shirt while this year 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.210
 that was a blow is a club that has is that I have a very great affection for 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 he 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.649
 already the most 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.769
 I will never disrespect
