00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:05.450
 modern idea of ​​man 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.510
 comfort is unthinkable without electricity 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.450
 but the world began to use it completely 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.849
 recently 1800 then 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.699
 Italian physicist Alessandro Volta 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.920
 invented the first battery and thereby gave 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.770
 World 1 reliable permanent source 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.350
 electricity familie scientist 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.050
 immortalized since then the tension 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.609
 current measured in volts 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.859
 think only if it were not 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.599
 electricity man would have to 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.149
 give up bread and circuses 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.710
 where does electricity come from in our 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.120
 flat 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.309
 electric current coming into the house 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.739
 produced here on 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.430
 power plants using a special 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.700
 turbo electric generator machines let's see 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.920
 how does it work fixed part of the stator 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.250
 is a bipolar magnet 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.350
 rotor rotates inside it 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.660
 wrapped copper wire rotation 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.629
 inside the magnet leads to a constant 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.330
 polarity reversal and electronic wire 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.540
 come into motion so born 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.119
 electric current but to current 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.600
 some kind of mechanical force was produced 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.119
 must constantly rotate the company 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.130
 let's see how it happens on 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.580
 thermal power plants in the boiler are heated 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.430
 water up to 450 degrees water 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.070
 turns into steam under high pressure 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.189
 it comes from the boiler to the turbine blades 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.540
 and the turbine shaft rotates at a frequency of 3000 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.300
 rpm setting in motion the shaft 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.620
 electric generator 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.990
 by the way the world's first power station 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.460
 public use was built 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.720
 in new york in 1882 she was producing 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 constant current and fed our 10,000 lamps 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.000
 the station generates thousands of times more 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.060
 work to the turbines enough to light 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.390
 and heat the city with a population of 100,000 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.250
 the man on the cable the current goes to 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.400
 distribution substation for 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.870
 measurement and conversion 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.520
 transformers increase voltage 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.400
 up to 10,000 volts 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.920
 why does high voltage occur 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.040
 less electricity transmission loss 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.630
 over a long distance of 10 thousand volts 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.180
 power lines 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.790
 at speeds up to 3000 kilometers in 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.670
 second will pass a considerable way before 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.150
 get to our house next the current flows 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.680
 step-down transformer 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.900
 should reduce its voltage to 220 in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.480
 Why 220 such in Russia standard 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.909
 In the USA, for example, the standard is taken 110 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.069
 volt only after lowering 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.430
 electricity will come by wire in 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.170
 distribution networks of our city and 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.189
 then directly to consumers 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.459
 light and heat 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:59.680
 it’s clear to us now where it comes from 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.680
 electricity in our sockets
