24th<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.570> don't<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.050> an<00:01:01.170> annual<00:01:01.530> thing

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
24th I don't think it's an annual thing
it's<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.460> actually<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:02.910> common<00:01:03.270> than

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's more it's actually more common than

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's more it's actually more common than
annual<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.189> pretty<00:01:05.400> common

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
annual so it's it's it's a pretty common
