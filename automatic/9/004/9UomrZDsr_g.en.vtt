00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello today we are going to make a wave 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.879
 today we are going to make a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.320
 flavoring for the car and right now 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.140
 show the things you're going to need 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.900
 they are very easy it is very simple to do 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.609
 and here I'm going to list you well what 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.060
 first thing we're going to occupy is going to be 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.029
 needle and thread the color here will depend on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 your taste felt in this case I'm going to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.400
 make a heart so I'm going to choose 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.350
 felt red red thread so that 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.140
 combine or you can put it in another color 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 so that you highlight the edges you also go 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.110
 to occupy rat tail a piece for 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.410
 this is going to be to hang the heart on 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.150
 the mirror of the car some essence of your 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 preference in this case I'm going to 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.120
 use orange and cotton and this 2 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.880
 good we begin 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.230
 I'm going to put the double filter 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.230
 to cut my heart 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.680
 and I'm going to hold it with a needle 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.290
 pins 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.790
 I will snip with scissors good 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.010
 that also missed mentioning that also 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.080
 more than occupying scissors and only occupies 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.360
 It's a little bit of felt I 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.030
 I have this because I have ornaments 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.350
 Christmas and I left and left over 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.060
 but good 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.660
 we started I'm going to cut back and right now 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.660
 he came back 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 I've finished trimming the heart already 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.860
 next I will sew it start 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.930
 sew to start good to start 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.259
 sew everyone from the middle of the part 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.229
 from above all around until the other 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.000
 half up here because here we go 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.920
 to start filling and right now 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.440
 I explain the other steps but while 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.040
 I will start to know from here towards 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.159
 here all around and ended here 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.890
 good here fosterments action around 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.960
 and you have this opening 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.200
 and now what I'm going to do explained the 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.330
 button that you enter in the heart you 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.330
 I'm going to add this essential oil 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.290
 good adding the little heat 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.299
 how 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.120
 it was not for us to take a hundred 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.120
 but it does not matter 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.030
 but we're trying it a bit 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.959
 it will not depend on how aromatic you want 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.959
 you 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.930
 how much you want to hurt the heart 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.600
 that's why I'm adding a 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.880
 moderate amount but if you want it more 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.480
 traumatic, nothing more to add more 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.480
 essence 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.780
 I'm staying 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.100
 how are we going to add one more and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.100
 ends 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:09.250
 and now I'm going to finish sewing 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.190
 with rat remembered thread as already 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.200
 that will depend holder as you want and 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.430
 then I want to help you I just think that 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.780
 go well has the mirror 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.440
 and the heart is not far below 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.220
 of 20 centimeters this will have the taste 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.220
 from everyone 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.280
 and what I'm going to do now is that in the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.310
 pure half of the heart here I'm going to 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.510
 put 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.510
 and I'm going to sew 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.809
 well I'm going to sew so they see the 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.809
 final score 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.430
 although I'm finishing my heart 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.530
 and coastal 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.590
 here does not matter the way you 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.830
 are sewing any way 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.210
 any form is valid 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.240
 and this is who work for you and so 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.620
 I do not know how to explain it but 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.249
 soon in another video les and les 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.419
 I will tell how the stitches are made 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.419
 it's a yes to do 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.980
 and I liked it because it reinforces well the 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.340
 sides and so we will prevent the heart from 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.340
 open 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.520
 one almost finished 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.689
 this is the last stitches 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.999
 and ready from last 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.230
 or 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.289
 excuse the lights is a little the day 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.279
 half stranger is getting a lot of sun 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.759
 through the windows 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.790
 that's why it's this one that looks weird half 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.110
 the picture 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.110
 but good here we continue 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.300
 this I'm going to do the knot and a double 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.120
 to 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.880
 and now our heart is ready 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.760
 and that's how you 're going to see 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.570
 you can put it a little shorter if you 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.220
 you like it but that's how I loved it and so 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.980
 it's how my flavoring will look 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.730
 my car and it has a delicious aroma very 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.950
 subtle and the good thing about this flavoring is 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.770
 that you choose the fragrance of your 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.650
 preference and believe me they will last a 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.760
 considerable time good we can try 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.760
 finally video bye
