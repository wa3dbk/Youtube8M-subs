00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 very good girls very drastic today 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.940
 and preto welcome to a new chapter 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.709
 our pc to pieces if after 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.289
 so long we are here on the straight 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.300
 final for the final assembly of 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.640
 our pc the truth is that we already have 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.320
 you want to see if now, since potatoes are coming 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.980
 the kings do not come as we can 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.350
 finish the total assembly and you know 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.900
 that I am suffering a lot with my 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.420
 current pc is a quad core with 4 gigs of 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 ram and the poor thing because it is already 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.390
 reaching its limit and the truth is that 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.640
 it is necessary to be able to finish it like this 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.499
 that we hope that the kings at least 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.260
 behave well and bring the processor 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:50.530
 so we'll see what happens that's 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.659
 another chapter of the end and we are in a 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.479
 new chapter to thank core 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:59.409
 continue as usual and attention because 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:03.339
 here we have the ram memory the vengeance 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.640
 or revenge or whatever you want to call it and 8 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.290
 ram gb 2 x 4 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.320
 we will do the unboxing as always 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.900
 truth is that corset and reliability quality 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.820
 I love the brand I saw it and I 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.110
 I loved before now I love five 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.970
 times more I say it really 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.270
 I do not know, I have explained it very many 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.910
 times but it's that elegance that has the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 mark the one that holds me captive di simÃ³ I know 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.180
 that there are so many other brands and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.930
 you can choose the one you like 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.729
 but the truth is that to me personally 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.720
 yes aroma that elegance is what I 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.000
 He is enthralled not to corsair and that's what 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.800
 I say for me not to me they do not force me to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.140
 saying this I do not say it because I do not think 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.479
 really and that's what he said this 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.220
 we went to see the unboxing the review and 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.690
 for everyone who asks me here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.970
 in the source in the description you have a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.710
 link where you can buy this piece of 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.050
 ram memory so I hope that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.540
 enjoy this video a hug to 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.550
 everyone and see you in the next chao 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.000
 and here we are in the unboxing of the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.420
 ram memory of core 6 you already know ddr3 two 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.280
 modules of 4gb in total 8 gigas a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 ram memory that is presented in a 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.400
 box as always elegant very well 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.860
 very well packaged and especially very 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.600
 well presented and you see that you will see 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 it's going to cost me to open it because it has 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.620
 as a kind of double plastic where 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 comes the ram memory then very well 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.540
 packaged everything has to be said- for 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.660
 prevent it from being damaged and that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.520
 come from bad conditions 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.770
 perfect in this aspect another of the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.560
 things to note is that ram memory 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.330
 comes optimized to have 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.660
 Compatibility with all CPUs and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.860
 most recent base plates 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.340
 the modules come in 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.800
 configurations of 1.5 and 135 volts 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.110
 to be able to offer maximum compatibility 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.350
 with mostly the intel processors 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.110
 core i3 i5 i7 as well as the entire range 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.940
 second generation intel core also 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.920
 It is available in configurations of 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.110
 double channel triple and quadruple that is to say that 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.850
 If you want to have this memory 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.410
 ram there is no problem whatsoever 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.660
 because it ensures that some of them 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.810
 adjust to your motherboard and I remember that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.510
 mine is a the 1150 axis of gigabyte 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.850
 therefore there is no problem in it or 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.830
 be that all perfect another of the things 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.709
 to highlight is the ability to 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.440
 overclocking that has this ram memory 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.470
 I am sincere and I will not perform 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.019
 like to perform overclocking but 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.989
 you know that for tastes colors and there 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.420
 people who love to take their 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.340
 components to the maximum and with this memory 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.830
 you can do it in a very easy way 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.520
 because you're ram memory have a 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.739
 xmp memory profile that guarantees a 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.680
 simple overclocking and above all 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.989
 sure each module is programmed in 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.160
 factory individually with this 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.319
 profile x mp indicating latency the 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.420
 frequency and voltage that are 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.180
 admitted by ram memories 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.640
 you just have to activate the xmp in a 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.000
 compatible motherboard base and automatically 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.479
 we can have the overclock and 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.430
 optimized without having to worry about 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:24.479
 touch bios topics or any story 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.030
 you already know that if you are overclockers 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.860
 experienced, you can adjust the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.900
 parameters to your liking to get a 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.680
 Logically overclocking performance 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.660
 superior but good and also something to 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.900
 highlight these are how you see memories 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.840
 rams that are black but there are 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.590
 a wide range of blue green colors and 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 red that good this for good cool no 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.020
 because if you want your plate 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.030
 that you hit it and that it has a color there 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.760
 people who are flirtatious as you can also 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.690
 know that you can also add the 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.550
 of different colors not me for being 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.150
 because opted performance reliability 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.860
 elegance not only not just because he says so 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.370
 me but because it has a recognition 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.370
 world famous 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.060
 all the people who overclock ea in the 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.880
 The world recognizes that in matters of 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.050
 ram memory core 6 is high performance 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.930
 by excellence 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.800
 you have records when assembling 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.210
 equipment for video games and well there are 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.200
 another thing that calls a lot the 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.600
 attention and is that 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.000
 has a limited lifetime warranty 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.580
 core sail so if you invest in 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.260
 RAM is protected as 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.970
 all core memory products 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.030
 continue to have limited warranty 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.380
 as well done for life so 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.520
 I hope you liked it I am going to 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.550
 leave here the specifications 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.350
 techniques for the most knowledgeable in the 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.530
 topic and nothing I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.960
 as always I hope with all pleasure 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.840
 see us in the last chapter of our 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.250
 pc to pieces with the processor a hug 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.250
 and see you in the next chao
