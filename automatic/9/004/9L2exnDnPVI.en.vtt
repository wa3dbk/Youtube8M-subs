00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.769
 copé done today I 'm going to do a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.969
 video that I find super important it 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.410
 a long time I woman and I 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.299
 even never took the time precisely of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.369
 film it and publish it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.630
 I wanted to talk about the skin type because 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.250
 that it's really the basis of everything 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 which is cosmetic rota makeup 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 picked care and often incarnation of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.869
 fruits our skin types now 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.010
 we do research on the internet 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.130
 we will end up with 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.170
 questionnaires of 56 question with eight 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 a thousand possibilities so brief do them 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.739
 that's five classes and find a single 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 question that allowed you to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 discover that she is little standing so 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 this question is it your 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.350
 skin tends and drian for two 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 days we compare the face if yes we 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.590
 has two options 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 are we breaking only on the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.079
 zone t domfront nose chin or is it 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 it is gone this stay on the nitrogen that we 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.430
 no longer dry them at the level of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 cheeks in a mixed skin 6 to the ear of 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
 everywhere it is that we have oily skin 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.840
 often to the south for grass valley by whom 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 are very marked very visible to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.409
 the opposite of the spectrum if we say no 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.930
 poor and not during the day 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 we have two choices so we can either have 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 dry skin or have a normal skin 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 a thought had characterized by a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 skin grain that is very very weak 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.159
 we do not really see fear then she drinks 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.530
 all the talent and the repression has 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.240
 produces more sebum to produce more 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 20 to address from rihanna can not done 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.290
 that drinks a normal skin 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.329
 as for she is going to have a skin texture 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.119
 which is a little bit more targeted for 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.020
 to have somewhere here all that but the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.400
 IP needs to be often with me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.170
 so that's it for my question makes you 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 know that it is what your skin type 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.759
 which happens small precision it's 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.409
 that often people will think that in 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.210
 for example, from summer to winter 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.610
 we find ourselves not a mixed skin 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.799
 and poor dry what happens is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 that the hapoël spare and tons it 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.240

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 fat is dehydrated for mixed by 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.090

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 really a status of a state of being of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.740
