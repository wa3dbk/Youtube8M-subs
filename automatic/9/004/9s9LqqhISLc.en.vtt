00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:17.380
 Good day, dear lovers 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 sunny grape vines in this 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.899
 I want to tell a video about how 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.710
 correctly form a young course here 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:36.399
 we had a bottle and how we see 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:39.730
 Here 8 has developed ran like this 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:44.470
 nutrition on the development of these shoots goes 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.320
 Now mainly due to the power of the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.800
 seedling as the root system is still well 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.600
 suction roots and began to grow and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.809
 the seedlings are not fed through them 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:03.119
 then the food goes mostly a with a margin 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:06.579
 for summer woods and saplings we need 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.590
 break the extra beat to the main 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:14.229
 beat evolved well which we 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.149
 leave and so how much ran to leave 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.929
 it all depends on the amount of active 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.539
 temperatures 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:24.459
 your region on the temperature of the bag 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:26.499
 can learn from the internet less 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.969
 lower temperate amount of active temperatures 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:33.299
 the less beat 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.299
 need to leave on the seedlings 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.790
 In principle, I recommend leaving well 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.190
 more than three ran it uniquely here 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.440
 we will remove the extra shoots to leave 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.710
 take it if in the covering area 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.410
 viticulture uniquely to the top 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.340
 shoots that you leave blurred 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.920
 below ground level was comfortable 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.260
 shape the bush future if fan 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.190
 shaping will be convenient later 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.190
 close if 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.690
 winter hardy frost-resistant grapes and not 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.400
 where they hide in principle here without 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.730
 differences which shoots better break off well 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.270
 I'll be more comfortable here two 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.490
 escape and one escape it will escape 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.620
 replacements then if it is bad 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.860
 develop pinch the reason for it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.970
 Just leave 2 runs for now. 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.300
 shoots that leave tied up 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.850
 vertically in principle the first year than 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.940
 vertical and will grow escape so he 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.970
 there will be a power of growth there will be more here we 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.580
 we will definitely remove this one 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.239
 weak escape they are gently removed 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.750
 you can fingers then this escape is not 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.790
 need here from 8 we leave 2 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.870
 I will leave this escape and this one 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.690
 could by this escape 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.080
 it will be more convenient for me as a trellis 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.640
 I will have a future in that country 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:16.660
 we delete this escape once and this one 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.930
 here we have 2 escapes visible on it 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.360
 okay and this lower escape it will be 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.760
 escape of replacement if there are all three 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.709
 develop well I put 3 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 it all depends on the development of the bush and the same 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.470
 how much to leave and if 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.910
 This is worse to develop unequivocally than 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.850
 higher take so they will be better 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.239
 develop this i will forgive knu there two or three 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:45.430
 sheet put the rest pinch in 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.640
 principle, such a simple shaping is 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.920
 First year 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.470
 In principle, the names will grow centimeters 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.390
 can up to 5 on saplings then growth 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.000
 stop it is no big deal 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.130
 since then the wait will start to grow 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.320
 roots and somewhere in June already harder 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.520
 more strong growth will seem 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:12.140
 it will be better to develop while landing 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.930
 you literally two weeks have passed 2 or 3 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.590
 such a development I will say that our bottle 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.160
 OK 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.450
 frost protected twice were 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.450
 frost up to 5 frost some bushes 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:35.880
 even froze here under the bottle all 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:37.770
 as we have seen well, okay while you can tendril 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.470
 also cover the bottle when the shoots are already 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.540
 will start to rest against the bottle 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.340
 shoot and 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.720
 cause from the south side either tsifir 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.640
 another is whether any delivery 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.520
 In principle, this is not a difficult process. 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.950
 how best to break it out so as not to 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.810
 to consume food saplings but I also want 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.780
 say and watering principle so 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.229
 the way of landing when we are covered with black 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.770
 film often do not need to be watered as 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.710
 we get it messed up and she 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:19.290
 the soil is quite wet active nitrogen 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:24.660
 together your not so evaporates show 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:28.760
 on the ground, well, although the rains came in principle 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.760
 that the soil is quite difficult and although 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.850
 the time of landing never watered 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.310
 it rained quite it is not compacted 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.090
 loose soil 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.129
 it's okay it's fine if it rains 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:51.659
 go water low 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:57.610
 if the rain is then watered then 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:06:00.610
 somewhere 1 15 days can be a bucket of water 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.239
 whether to remove the film pour to let in this 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.279
 the hole from where the bottle was removed 

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:09.580
 quietly lichku lichku vodichki 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:11.679
 this is just a fortnight quite 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.550
 enough since we once again 

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:17.709
 I repeat, in principle, all 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.110
 who have any questions comment 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:22.539
 leave comments will be very 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:27.629
 appreciate it subscribe to 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:30.819
 good luck channel all stable yields 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:33.849
 forgot to say another sapling covered if 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:36.129
 suddenly appear inflorescences that is rosi 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:40.289
 the future of the grape necessarily them 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.289
 remove all labor now
