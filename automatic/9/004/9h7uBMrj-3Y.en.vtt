00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 all then after seeing the video of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.610
 dani in which he showed snapshots 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.139
 of the medium- length film that sees it 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.969
 protagonist or west and I decided to 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 show you the official trailer you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.609
 you will say daffinÃ  why you will see it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.359
 because he has a small cast 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.910
 role too but above all because 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:32.160
 this footage is therefore direct 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.250
 boy is writer when i want 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.210
 say that director in the detached by chance 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 it is not symptomatic because it has all hard 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.850
 director and actor 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.739
 then I got the road written 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.539
 because the plot is very intricate and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.430
 so every thing you say we have 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.510
 say it because it strips as I am 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.910
 the direction of the commercials 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.309
 when one looks at a movie that is already awake 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.850
 at the end 86 I write you it is 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.940
 so here is the director scriptwriter 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.430
 actor tells us kind among things with 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 insane comedy then new process 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.960
 castro because already three categories 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 plot the story tells the story of one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.950
 ruthless contract killer is two 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.110
 guys looking for fame and success these 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.549
 are the plots that give kind of more TV 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 which give two lines that do not understand a 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.490
 fuck and congenital but wait for it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.189
 now I'll show you the thriller but first 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.990
 of the trainer I owe you to us it seems that the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 cast is full of trash where you are 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 forced to see but two slaps 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 in the face but then there will be from there where 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.780
 protagonist who dictates it inside one 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.270
 what like 36 times but it's right 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.909
 reiterate then say share with the battery 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.009
 there will be my boyfriend who does 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.590
 part of it and you have also seen it 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.829
 in snack shocks or give yourself so why 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 before or after three because we know anyway 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.060
 there he never shows up I want 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.119
 say less than from that tetanus of photos 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.250
 or ddps of videos so why don't you have us 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.500
 you never see the real space, oh well 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.740
 I satisfied 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.259
 and then there will be uncle claudio that of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.370
 bins you know gift of pecks bin 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.650
 he too if there is no cast is 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.579
 absolutely trashissimo now let's see if 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.840
 the trailer 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:21.629
 I will put dumb because otherwise goes to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.819
 double voice fucking shit then me 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.510
 I'll move a little more here so you see 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.140
 here 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.030
 the mini trader if you want to see it big 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.099
 like asshole for damage or maybe to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.500
 plus you can directly click the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.450
 completion the square to click 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.569
 give him the channel of the independent ace 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.519
 productions and see it big but leave 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.530
 believe that if because i know it from 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.450
 cell phone what else the case every time 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:56.430
 you can't see so here I am 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.210
 ok, however, we see the trailer yes 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.290
 Mrs 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:14.540
 let's hear what matters 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:14.540
 I saw the whole thing the way you understand it 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.420
 my uncle 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:52.440
 no you don't have a look at 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:55.050
 unfair kabul earrings and this is it 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.330
 it is deliberately not understood or bardach 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.410
 so you are obliged to go to 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.819
 then see when the video comes out 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.040
 you are obliged to see it if not 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.660
 the slap in the face of anyone 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.090
 in order to avoid that under this video there 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.980
 believe when it comes out 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.930
 I tell you what the movie files of assemblies 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.440
 the races in which there is no exit with 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:24.419
 the video neither of pax and you click e 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:26.250
 these cases this is how much and only 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.080
 at the end 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.010
 no, if you have seen someone, you are 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.630
 dreamed you know we can't see 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.630
 okay this thing to the challenge
