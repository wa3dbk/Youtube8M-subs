player<00:03:03.950> when<00:03:04.189> he<00:03:04.219> came<00:03:04.400> over<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.790> North

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
player when he came over to North

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.929 
player when he came over to North
America<00:03:05.719> he<00:03:06.319> really<00:03:06.859> didn't<00:03:07.189> speak<00:03:07.639> a<00:03:07.760> whole

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
America he really didn't speak a whole

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.020 
America he really didn't speak a whole
lot<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.150> English<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:10.340> went<00:03:10.489> out<00:03:10.579> on<00:03:10.760> his<00:03:10.879> own

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
lot of English you went out on his own

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.300 
lot of English you went out on his own
and<00:03:11.090> took<00:03:11.689> some<00:03:11.840> English<00:03:12.200> classes<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.010> as

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
and took some English classes and as

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.069 
and took some English classes and as
improved<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.359> era<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:14.629> he's<00:03:14.750> not<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.900> real

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
improved in that era so he's not a real

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.140 
improved in that era so he's not a real
vocal<00:03:15.349> leader<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.799> think<00:03:16.040> he's<00:03:16.159> he's<00:03:16.729> more<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.090> a

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
vocal leader I think he's he's more of a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.869 
vocal leader I think he's he's more of a
leader<00:03:17.389> on<00:03:18.199> the<00:03:18.470> ice<00:03:18.590> by<00:03:18.829> example<00:03:19.280> as<00:03:19.849> I

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
leader on the ice by example as I

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.339 
leader on the ice by example as I
mentioned<00:03:20.510> he's<00:03:20.690> one<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:20.989> those<00:03:21.079> guys<00:03:21.139> that

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
mentioned he's one of those guys that

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.619 
mentioned he's one of those guys that
wants<00:03:21.949> the<00:03:22.010> puck<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.489> big<00:03:22.669> game<00:03:22.879> situations

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
wants the puck in big game situations

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.990 
wants the puck in big game situations
and<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.870> think<00:03:24.139> he<00:03:24.319> utilizes<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.519> part<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.879> his

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and I think he utilizes that part of his

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.729 
and I think he utilizes that part of his
game<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.479> show<00:03:26.659> the<00:03:26.810> younger<00:03:27.139> guys<00:03:27.349> on<00:03:27.620> the
