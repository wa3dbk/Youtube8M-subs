the main reason why we're not flying is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.850 
the main reason why we're not flying is
because<00:01:26.479> well<00:01:27.479> money's<00:01:27.990> been<00:01:28.200> tight<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.710> we

because well money's been tight so we

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.970 
because well money's been tight so we
haven't<00:01:29.070> been<00:01:29.340> able<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.640> afford<00:01:30.090> it

where<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.890> might<00:04:57.919> go<00:04:58.390> because<00:04:59.390> we<00:04:59.840> have<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.140> be

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
where it might go because we have to be
