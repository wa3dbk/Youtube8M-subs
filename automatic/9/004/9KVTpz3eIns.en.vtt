00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.900 

Kojo<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.419> a<00:00:18.450> clinically<00:00:19.110> healthy<00:00:19.680> gorilla<00:00:20.279> but

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
Kojo is a clinically healthy gorilla but

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
Kojo is a clinically healthy gorilla but
it<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.570> risk<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.960> developing<00:00:22.079> heart

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it is at risk of developing heart

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.830 
it is at risk of developing heart
disease<00:00:23.009> so<00:00:23.310> our<00:00:23.460> goal<00:00:23.759> is<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> monitor<00:00:24.660> him

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
disease so our goal is to monitor him

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.109 
disease so our goal is to monitor him
clinically<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.859> make<00:00:26.039> sure<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.609> catch<00:00:26.849> him

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
clinically to make sure we catch him

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.779 
clinically to make sure we catch him
before<00:00:27.300> he<00:00:27.599> starts<00:00:27.929> to<00:00:28.170> becoming<00:00:28.529> ill<00:00:28.920> we

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
before he starts to becoming ill we

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
before he starts to becoming ill we
anesthetized<00:00:30.420> him<00:00:30.750> last<00:00:30.960> week<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.740> looked

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
anesthetized him last week and we looked

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.820 
anesthetized him last week and we looked
for<00:00:32.519> the<00:00:32.669> best<00:00:33.089> places<00:00:33.449> that<00:00:34.080> we<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.379> insert

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
for the best places that we could insert

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.710 
for the best places that we could insert
this<00:00:35.070> device<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.850> did<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> process<00:00:36.510> called

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
this device we did a process called

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.810 
this device we did a process called
mapping<00:00:37.140> which<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.040> where<00:00:38.220> we<00:00:38.339> put<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.699> in

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
mapping which is where we put it in

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.939 
mapping which is where we put it in
different<00:00:38.970> regions<00:00:39.330> around<00:00:39.839> his<00:00:40.019> body<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.739> see

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
different regions around his body to see

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.130 
different regions around his body to see
where<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.760> could<00:00:41.969> still<00:00:42.180> pick<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.539> the<00:00:42.690> EKG

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
where we could still pick up the EKG

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
where we could still pick up the EKG
wave<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> location<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> wouldn't

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
wave but in a location that wouldn't

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.860 
wave but in a location that wouldn't
bother<00:00:45.480> him

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
bother him

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
bother him
we<00:00:46.559> looked<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.920> below<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> skin<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
we looked at just below the skin and the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.779 
we looked at just below the skin and the
sternum<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.110> looked<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.440> his<00:00:49.530> armpit<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sternum we looked at his armpit and in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.580 
sternum we looked at his armpit and in
the<00:00:50.910> end<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.360> found<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> place<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.110> his<00:00:52.289> back

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the end we found a place on his back

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
the end we found a place on his back
where<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> wouldn't<00:00:53.820> bother<00:00:53.969> him<00:00:54.359> at<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.629> but

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
where it wouldn't bother him at all but

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.590 
where it wouldn't bother him at all but
yet<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.469> still<00:00:55.739> receive<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> EKG<00:00:57.000> waves

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.890 

we<00:01:02.600> have<00:01:02.930> been<00:01:03.140> struggling<00:01:03.770> with<00:01:04.900> treating

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
we have been struggling with treating

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.040 
we have been struggling with treating
the<00:01:06.110> gorillas<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:06.860> years<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.490> one<00:01:08.450> we<00:01:08.720> have<00:01:09.020> a

the gorillas for years and one we have a
gorilla<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:09.560> has<00:01:09.980> disease<00:01:10.460> we<00:01:10.820> struggle

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
gorilla that has disease we struggle

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.810 
gorilla that has disease we struggle
with<00:01:11.510> how<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.780> assess<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.620> gorillas<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.250> how

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
with how to assess the gorillas and how

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.150 
with how to assess the gorillas and how
to<00:01:13.880> monitor<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.170> gorillas<00:01:15.440> clinically<00:01:15.920> and

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
to monitor the gorillas clinically and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.390 
to monitor the gorillas clinically and
it<00:01:16.670> occurred<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.060> me<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.960> we<00:01:18.170> have<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.860> device

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
it occurred to me that we have a device

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.370 
it occurred to me that we have a device
that<00:01:19.640> we<00:01:19.730> use<00:01:19.760> in<00:01:20.030> humans<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:21.140> could

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
that we use in humans that could

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.520 
that we use in humans that could
potentially<00:01:22.160> be<00:01:22.820> useful<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.320> gorilla

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530

one might think that it would be

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.030 
one might think that it would be
difficult<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:44.000> train<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.660> gorilla<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.500> present
