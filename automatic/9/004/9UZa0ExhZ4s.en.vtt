 adda today i present you a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.880
 application that allows to have a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.900
 offline translator then it seems 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.370
 all stupid but there is not much 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.960
 of applications that do that usually it 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 must be connected to the internet for 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.460
 can translate a word a phrase etc 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 like for example google translation 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 thanks to the application language is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.720
 available for 89 cents on the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.970
 source on the app store 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 you will be able to translate into any 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 which language or almost any 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.830
 word for example if you are at 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 the alien etc 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
 so it's available on the appstore 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 so you'll download it once 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.469
 it's done you see it especially 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.750
 springboard wanted to throw in less and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.149
 in my little h games then if you 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 can already see who has a pretty design 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.270
 well done it's pretty clear we see that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.739
 this application is well summer 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 worked then you have several 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.949
 languages ​​english spanish german 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 english french english and italian 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.019
 english dutch english etc 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.970
 so you have a whole panel of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
 dictionaries to download as well 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.500
 easy just click right here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.450
 on the small download or click 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.700
 then on download this fact that these 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 hero ie 16 megawatts and so 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's not very heavy it does not take 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.479
 a lot of room on the phone 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.180
 contrary to what we might think 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.060
 when I'm told it's offline 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.890
 so that downloads in the options you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 will have several possibilities you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 first to flights go see help 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.220
 opinions would remain the shareholder and 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.509
 go back to the very beginning by removing 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.270
 the dictionaries you install 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.810
 right after you can subscribe on 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.799
 twitter and to the application notes and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.630
 that's all 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.470
 all the trimmings we usually have on 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.000
 all applications 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 so we'll wait until the end of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.810
 download can see that for example 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 if I open a dictionary that has a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.219
 translator that has already been downloaded 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 can see that I have all the ills of 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.149
 the alphabet that can be displayed here is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 an industrial quantity 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.840
 what is good with this dictionary 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 is that when you are looking for the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.170
 translation of a word you will have all the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.849
 possible senses and like that you risk 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.760
 you will not be left 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.409
 misinterpretation 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.819
 I do German is often there 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.379
 are some people from my case who are going 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.060
 search in the dictionary and who 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.989
 take a word except that it's in the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.739
 wrong way if it means 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.120
 completely something else so the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.349
 english french dictionary and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.670
 download see it's fast enough 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.280
 while I do not have many bars 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.980
 connection so you go into the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 dictionary and we will search in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.140
 French you can change the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.879
 dictionary up right 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.470
 just like those had seen that it's 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.310
 well done so we'll take a word in 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.640
 French we will look for example at 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.409
 dead or alive book read here and there you 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.629
 have to read when it's a text and to 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.819
 wrinkles read carefully cause a 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.109
 document spurs and so that's it you're going 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.049
 all the time that I took a bad 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.000
 example not a pleated can see that 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.060
 it's a verb that has many meanings 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.430
 when his hair is such a word when 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.349
 Celine ornithology is so 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.129
 when his clothes are so so 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.959
 see you can not do any 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.760
 contraflow is pretty well done for 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.930
 go back to the beginning you saw that you 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.810
 can do a little effect like that a 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.680
 small effect of crease slip 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.329
 I say 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.889
 and to remove the search enough to 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.849
 slide to the left so that's it 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.359
 simple young others and that that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.190
 walk too 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.049
 when not connected to the internet 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.079
 so I disable the wi fi 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.889
 I'm going to search for a word adjusted by 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.019
 example and here you have the 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.930
 offline dictionary it works very 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.000
 well and you have no problem of 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.410
 to make a misconception and so so 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.269
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 think of this application in the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.910
 comments and I tell you to 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.690
 soon in a future video 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.690
