type so can actually do is just lean
over<00:00:59.700> the<00:00:59.880> printer<00:01:01.250> pull<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:03.619> float<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
over the printer pull that out float the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.169 
over the printer pull that out float the
shitty<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> orientation<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.180> need<00:01:08.179> push

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
shitty way of orientation you need push

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.899 
shitty way of orientation you need push
it<00:01:09.329> forward<00:01:09.719> now<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.950> loading<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.549> quite<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it forward now I'm loading it quite a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
it forward now I'm loading it quite a
bit<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> skew<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.469> it<00:01:13.590> should

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bit of skew on there so it should

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.770 
bit of skew on there so it should
actually<00:01:13.950> come<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> tell<00:01:15.420> us<00:01:15.539> that<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
actually come back and tell us that we

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
actually come back and tell us that we
need<00:01:15.929> to<00:01:15.960> correct<00:01:16.289> ask<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> show<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
need to correct ask you just to show you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.080 
need to correct ask you just to show you

what is required beside it pull in the
paper<00:01:21.329> with

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.680 

obviously<00:01:39.940> they've<00:01:40.090> been<00:01:40.180> loaded<00:01:40.480> with<00:01:40.510> an

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
obviously they've been loaded with an

obviously they've been loaded with an
off<00:01:40.810> SKU<00:01:41.050> because<00:01:41.410> it's<00:01:41.560> gone<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.890> their<00:01:42.070> first

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
off SKU because it's gone in their first

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.900 
off SKU because it's gone in their first
time<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.120> ready<00:01:44.610> basically<00:01:45.610> if

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
time and it's it's ready basically if

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.450 
time and it's it's ready basically if
the<00:01:46.150> paper<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.600> too<00:01:46.630> skewed<00:01:47.230> what<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.220> will<00:01:48.310> say

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
the paper is too skewed what it will say

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.670 
the paper is too skewed what it will say
to<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:49.540> will<00:01:49.630> Pope<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.960> paper<00:01:50.170> out<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> fun

to you it will Pope a paper out the fun
here<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.270> says<00:01:52.420> loaded<00:01:52.870> with<00:01:53.020> too<00:01:53.170> much

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
here and it says loaded with too much

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.100 
here and it says loaded with too much
skew<00:01:53.710> ask<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.640> believe<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.420> pinch<00:01:55.870> leave

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
skew ask you to believe the pinch leave

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.210 
skew ask you to believe the pinch leave
up<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.500> this<00:01:57.460> fever<00:01:57.730> up<00:01:57.970> here<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.010> release

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
up to this fever up here so you release

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.640 
up to this fever up here so you release
that<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:01.060> then<00:02:01.570> just<00:02:01.780> line<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.200> paper<00:02:02.410> in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
that and then just line the paper in

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.850 
that and then just line the paper in
these<00:02:02.800> blue<00:02:03.430> dotted<00:02:03.730> line<00:02:04.000> here<00:02:04.800> put<00:02:05.800> the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
these blue dotted line here put the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.530 
these blue dotted line here put the
finished<00:02:06.130> leave<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.369> back<00:02:06.490> down<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:07.270> design

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
finished leave it back down the design

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.500 
finished leave it back down the design
gel<00:02:07.810> take<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.760> and<00:02:09.760> that's<00:02:09.940> basically<00:02:10.420> correct

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
gel take in and that's basically correct

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.180 
gel take in and that's basically correct
if<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.110> do<00:02:11.260> load<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.620> they<00:02:11.709> will<00:02:11.950> live<00:02:12.100> in

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
if you do load that they will live in

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.110 
if you do load that they will live in
too<00:02:12.370> much<00:02:12.520> Scoob

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
too much Scoob

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.310 
too much Scoob
okay<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.080> supers<00:02:14.590> that's<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.860> load<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.040> sheet
