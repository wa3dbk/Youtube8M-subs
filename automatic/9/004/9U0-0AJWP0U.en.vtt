00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.950 
with I'm using manic panics ultraviolet
and<00:01:16.200> past<00:01:16.500> Eliezer<00:01:17.450> originally<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.780> going

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and past Eliezer originally I was going

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080 
and past Eliezer originally I was going
for<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> pastel<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> figured<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.909> needed

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
for a pastel look so I figured I needed

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
for a pastel look so I figured I needed
to<00:01:21.299> mix<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> entire<00:01:21.840> contents<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> both<00:01:22.950> jars

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to mix the entire contents of both jars

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
to mix the entire contents of both jars
together<00:01:23.869> but<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.049> definitely<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.740> wrong

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
together but that's definitely the wrong

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.030 
together but that's definitely the wrong
thing<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.060> pastel<00:01:27.450> hair<00:01:28.040> even

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
thing to do if you want pastel hair even

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
thing to do if you want pastel hair even
after<00:01:29.310> using<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.360> paths<00:01:30.540> either<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
after using all of the paths either it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
after using all of the paths either it
was<00:01:31.350> still<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.590> dark<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> added<00:01:32.939> some
