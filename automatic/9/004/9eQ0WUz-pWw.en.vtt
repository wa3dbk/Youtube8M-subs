require energy from the cell it will

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.600 
require energy from the cell it will
also<00:00:35.219> discuss<00:00:36.739> different<00:00:37.739> types<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:40.610> active

also discuss different types of active

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.840 
also discuss different types of active
transport<00:00:42.329> mechanisms<00:00:43.460> which<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.789> should

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
transport mechanisms which we should

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
transport mechanisms which we should
know<00:00:45.360> by<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:48.110> transport<00:00:49.110> mechanisms

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
know by now our transport mechanisms

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:00.549 
know by now our transport mechanisms
that<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:51.680> required<00:00:53.660> energy<00:00:54.660> require<00:00:55.079> base<00:00:59.149> so

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
that are required energy require base so

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.650
