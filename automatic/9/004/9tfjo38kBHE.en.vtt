I'll<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.420> time<00:02:00.630> Mac's<00:02:01.320> voting<00:02:01.710> arenas<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.909> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
I'll be time Mac's voting arenas this is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.179 
I'll be time Mac's voting arenas this is
the<00:02:03.299> max<00:02:03.540> number<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> arenas<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.770> players

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the max number of arenas that players

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.260 
the max number of arenas that players
can<00:02:05.430> build<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.530> arenas<00:02:08.270> required

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

can build on so three arenas required
players<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> start<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> minimum

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
players to start this is the minimum

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.690

Raina's<00:02:12.480> chess<00:02:12.810> ID<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.290> believe<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.890> that

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
Raina's chess ID I believe that is that

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.790 
Raina's chess ID I believe that is that
grace<00:02:14.430> period<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.420> how<00:02:16.290> long<00:02:16.590> they

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
grace period this is like how long they

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.370 
grace period this is like how long they
can<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.640> invincibility<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.050> now<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.200> can

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
can go with invincibility so now we can

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.990 
can go with invincibility so now we can
hurt<00:02:19.500> them<00:02:19.560> within<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> first<00:02:20.310> 30<00:02:20.550> seconds<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
hurt them within the first 30 seconds of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.100 
hurt them within the first 30 seconds of
playing<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.360> game<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.660> can<00:02:21.780> change<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
playing the game you can change to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.530 
playing the game you can change to
whatever<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.620> want<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.480> automatically<00:02:24.480> at

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
whatever you want and automatically at

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.960 
whatever you want and automatically at
that<00:02:24.660> time<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> time<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.640> seconds

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that time so this is the time in seconds

and<00:03:03.530> now<00:03:04.530> we're<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.799> go<00:03:04.890> into<00:03:05.010> chests

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
and now we're going to go into chests

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.789 
and now we're going to go into chests
loot<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.209> open<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.840> up<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.319> here<00:03:07.560> basically

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
loot so open that up and here basically

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.840 
loot so open that up and here basically
level<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:09.230> from<00:03:10.230> most<00:03:10.500> common<00:03:11.040> chests

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
level one is from most common chests

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.229 
level one is from most common chests
loot<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.540> level<00:03:13.200> 5<00:03:13.410> which<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.739> rare<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.030> can

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
loot to level 5 which is rare so you can

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.509 
loot to level 5 which is rare so you can
change<00:03:15.540> whatever<00:03:15.900> items<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.560> want<00:03:16.829> inside<00:03:17.400> of

change whatever items you want inside of

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.509 
change whatever items you want inside of
these<00:03:17.609> chests<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:19.290> most<00:03:19.799> likely<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.220> players

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
these chests so most likely the players

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.250 
these chests so most likely the players
