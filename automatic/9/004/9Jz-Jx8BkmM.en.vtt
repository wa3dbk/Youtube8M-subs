00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.410
 with the youtube as they are 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:07.330
 Welcome to today katana well as 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.389
 they saw the title of the video because they 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.549
 I have some tips on how to save on your 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.209
 data connection in your data plan or 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.570
 prepaid mode regardless of the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.270
 company that obviously have these 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.210
 tips are only for android teams like this 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.180
 is that if they have one, then ask them 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.760
 other options are going to come similar to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.219
 the android 4.2 in front so 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.190
 I think that the infinite majority has a 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.890
 team with these characteristics like this is 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.230
 that we're going to start first we should 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.960
 play set correctly store 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.570
 automatic updates we owe 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.089
 deactivate we will leave you in or 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.940
 update applications automatically 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.730
 since many times the teams of 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.399
 factory and new then come with this 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 activated option and then at the time of 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.690
 put our chip or anything because 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.269
 all applications are going to 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.700
 update and all that roll then we 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.939
 will consume a lot of data 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.770
 translates to quite a lot of money lost being 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.469
 that we can update them with our 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.200
 wifi connection when we are in our 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.270
 home or somewhere else like that is that 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.969
 they can leave like this or update 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.110
 apps just for wifi any of 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.080
 It's both good 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.480
 and because nothing that's all about place 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.050
 thor now we go to another option 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.910
 quite interesting that allows us 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.420
 Android to restrict to the data by 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.460
 application for example ram that does not 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.220
 we use in the background in second 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.590
 plane is when we have the application 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.870
 closed 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.630
 and we are not using but still 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.420
 some applications in fact the most 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 come by default to this the use of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.290
 activated data so we're going to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.470
 restrict in applications that do not 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.930
 let's use for example I think it has not 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.660
 if it is active when you do not 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.119
 we are using the same here we have other 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.209
 applications like the flashlight that I do not 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.270
 I know why it consumes data and nothing else 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.460
 perhaps for advertising 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.880
 but good and the star is not going to 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.070
 consume when you do not use it 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.960
 those who decided to leave active are 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.810
 those that are used in the background 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.040
 how is whatsapp for example when the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.050
 phone is on standby 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.690
 or have the closed or have will be the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.360
 whatsapp application then still 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.100
 the two messages will arrive but 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.530
 if they restrict the data because they are not going 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.050
 to arrive when inactive 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.300
 phone so it's better to that 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.190
 leave it as it is for them to 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.110
 all your messages arrive and all that 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.440
 the next type is related to 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 whatsapp we also go to the settings 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.060
 of whatsapp and from there we're going to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.489
 to automatic download of multimedia 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.459
 here we verify that mobile data 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.590
 are all deactivated since if the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.830
 we activate for example the video the audio 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.130
 and that when they send us, let's say I do not know 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.870
 with a video of 2 3 megs then 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.180
 obviously that data consumption is going to 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.570
 to be very big, that's the way I 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.850
 I recommend that you deactivate that and 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.240
 only activate when they are on wifi 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.430
 in a wifi connection to yes yes there 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.580
 that you download them all automatic and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.430
 when not, then not when they are using their 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.620
 data connection as they disable that 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.260
 so that your consumption is not very 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.480
 big and that's going to save you a lot 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.620
 money 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.630
 and a lot of megas in your data plan 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.370
 well and another very important thing is 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.250
 also in games many games 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.830
 well now I do not have any installed 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.290
 but many games use advertising 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.530
 and that publicity is fed by its 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.330
 data connection or wifi then its 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.580
 what you have to do is disable 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.240
 let's say the data connection when one 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.110
 is playing because if not then first 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.340
 A) Yes 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.340
 yes yes no the application because it's going 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.250
 consume enough data and quite 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.320
 money then that's another option 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.340
 turn off the data connection when 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.300
 are playing and re-activate when 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.040
 stop playing or if they have any 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.370
 important message from whatsapp that 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.910
 receive or all that then go then no 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.400
 play dead watchmaker and that would be 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.669
 one option and another important thing is that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.199
 good, more than anything, an invitation to 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.389
 do not be afraid to use whatsapp a lot 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.120
 people think that they consume a lot of credit 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.850
 it consumes itself many megs but not 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.130
 consume almost nothing except if they send you 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.750
 images and uploads or videos and 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.280
 you can take them out if you are going to be 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.840
 a lot but does not spend very little and is very 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.940
 advisable to use it 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.009
 it touched me they heard the conversation of 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.259
 some people who used whatsapp 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.449
 only where there was wifi because I was 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.150
 he did something pretty silly because he spends 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:29.380
 very little of your balance from your plan 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.380
 data spends a nothing then they 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.380
 I recommend using it a lot and if they use 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.990
 these measures of let's say savings because 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.229
 I will not consume them practically almost 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.229
 nothing whatsapp very little then then 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.330
 I recommend using it to avoid 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.270
 use text messages 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.039
 traditional ones that are more expensive 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.949
 so then it's all leave me here in 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.139
 the comments any suggestion doubt or 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.050
 about other things you want to know 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.909
 of his team behind 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.099
 I do not know other tutorials or tips that 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.990
 want me to tell you here, leave it at 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.940
 comments and then nothing sent them a 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.990
 hello see you for the next video 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.990
 bye bye
