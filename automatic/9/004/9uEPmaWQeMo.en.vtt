 Also that South America like her in Tierpark Gettorf is tranquil 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.340
 the living lawn mowers work leisurely over the capybaras 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.569
 investment

 they are the largest rodents in the world 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.749
 Unsleben in the savannas and marshy river basins of South America 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.700
 also a nameless crane and two races 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.780
 Life in the enclosure is changed every year by their young 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.750
 They feed on Grasser herbs and insects 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.570
 like to take the ratites 1 including the park where the head and neck 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.570
 enjoyable by the dust low 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.350
 The stars of the South Americans, however, are the lowland papers 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 the primitive animals are related to rhinos 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290
 as the only stripe they through the rainforests of their original 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.850
 Home in the Amazon Basin 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 the two tapirs in Tierpark Gettorf, however, beside the company 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.810
 this last piece after petting 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.240
 and rejoice Enterprise is she must know 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 thanks pants ostrich bittersweet we as a party favor 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.800
 eans-adhoc Vienna at the white of the direct system at the desired pleger and 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.900
 Julia 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.030
 Rieger our humans this is the strongest annual decline in both 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.430
 It is also normal so Latta subjects, the men are actually always one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.690
 a bit smaller than the females with the Eifel a bit bigger and therefore a total 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.410
 a little stronger 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.300
 RÃ¼eger is now 13 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 so it is, so to speak, in the middle of the best manhood Julia is three 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.020
 So, old percent of Karmann si came she was still essential 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 smaller 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.219
 But now, in principle, two are washed out 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.479
 he also has quite interesting is this is the papers 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.690
 can see very bad tapirs are extremely short-sighted that is they take 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.959
 Actually, their picture itself is much more about the clocks and more 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.569
 especially of course over the nose after he realizes that just stop 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.239
 Once more comes she will always be with NASA at the very end when I arrive 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.349
 So the nose always goes where they think they perceive something 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.090
 Nahles can also extreme important what is important for the EM for them 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.410
 really so Alf Group and and hearing impressions actually much more important 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.410
 are not what you see as what you can see is not great 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.819
 the parsley is cleared up 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.659
 a pity, actually 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.049
 but you can still smile a little 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.959
 looking for the cuddly Compact 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.649
 a farewell one more special 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.359
 Now carefully check with the dripping wet nose on July 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.969
 lens of the camera 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.969
 Order must be 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.689
 and the end of the performance
