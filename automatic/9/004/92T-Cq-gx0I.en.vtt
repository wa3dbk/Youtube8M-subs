to automatically load up a little

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
to automatically load up a little
program<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.539> program<00:00:58.050> starts<00:00:58.620> up

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770

on before I can transfer files between
those<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.369> computers<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.479> even<00:01:12.600> sync

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
those two computers I can even sync

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
those two computers I can even sync
folders<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.340> look

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
folders so that I don't have to go look

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
folders so that I don't have to go look
for<00:01:14.670> certain<00:01:15.000> files<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.720> say<00:01:15.840> hit

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
for certain files I can just say hit

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.469 
for certain files I can just say hit
sync<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.770> pre-arranged<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:18.180> files

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
performance however the idea is is that

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.870 
performance however the idea is is that
now<00:02:29.380> i<00:02:29.410> can<00:02:29.890> control<00:02:30.220> all<00:02:30.459> these<00:02:30.670> different

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
now i can control all these different

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.479 
now i can control all these different
computers<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> certain<00:02:32.709> amount<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
computers up to a certain amount the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.280 
computers up to a certain amount the
service<00:02:33.819> costs<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.209> 10<00:02:34.569> bucks<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.930> month<00:02:35.050> I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
service costs about 10 bucks a month I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.449 
service costs about 10 bucks a month I
think<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:35.560> give<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.830> discount<00:02:36.220> if<00:02:36.430> you

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
think they give you a discount if you

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.610 
think they give you a discount if you
sign<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:37.000> whole<00:02:37.120> year<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.690> think<00:02:38.470> there's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
