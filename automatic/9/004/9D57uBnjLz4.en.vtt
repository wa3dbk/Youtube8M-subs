00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that shape that edge off so I saw a bit

00:01:24.930 --> 00:02:01.590 
that shape that edge off so I saw a bit
smoother<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.640> learned<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.000> up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.210 

okay<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:02.660> now<00:02:02.900> it's<00:02:03.050> nice<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.230> tidy<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.010> the

okay so now it's nice and tidy and the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.960 
okay so now it's nice and tidy and the
road<00:02:05.350> all<00:02:06.350> start<00:02:06.650> by<00:02:06.970> individually

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
road all start by individually

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.900 
road all start by individually
separating<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.929> plates<00:02:09.230> it<00:02:10.190> allows<00:02:10.490> render

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
separating the plates it allows render

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.300 
separating the plates it allows render
your<00:02:11.060> fingers<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.480> between<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.070> need<00:02:13.220> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
your fingers in between so you need to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.240 
your fingers in between so you need to
just<00:02:13.430> pull<00:02:13.670> them<00:02:13.820> straight<00:02:13.970> up<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.980> put<00:02:16.160> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
just pull them straight up and put it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.400 
just pull them straight up and put it
back<00:02:16.340> when<00:02:16.550> you're<00:02:16.670> finished

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
also I'll put another option on the side

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.450
