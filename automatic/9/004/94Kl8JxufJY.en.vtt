weather<00:00:18.330> let's<00:00:19.140> start<00:00:19.410> off<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> wind

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
weather let's start off with the wind

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
weather let's start off with the wind
now<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.390> five<00:00:21.539> stages<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.080> wind<00:00:22.350> each

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
now there are five stages of wind each

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.820 
now there are five stages of wind each
more<00:00:23.010> violent<00:00:23.430> than<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.580> last<00:00:24.230> it<00:00:25.230> starts<00:00:25.680> off

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
more violent than the last it starts off

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.859 
more violent than the last it starts off
as<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> nice<00:00:26.460> calm<00:00:26.849> wing<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.599> slowly

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
as a nice calm wing and it can slowly

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
as a nice calm wing and it can slowly
get<00:00:28.109> stronger<00:00:28.410> until<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> reaches<00:00:29.279> our

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
get stronger until it reaches our

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.089 
get stronger until it reaches our
full-blown<00:00:29.939> tornado<00:00:30.470> now<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.769> tell<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
full-blown tornado now you can tell the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.889 
full-blown tornado now you can tell the
intensity<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> storm<00:00:33.120> by<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> look<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
intensity of the storm by the look of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
intensity of the storm by the look of
how<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> leaves<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> trees<00:00:35.100> blew<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.670> how

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
how the leaves of the trees blew and how

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.840 
how the leaves of the trees blew and how
rough<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> water<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> also<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
rough the water is also as well as this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.299 
rough the water is also as well as this
mud<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.450> win<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.379> adds<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.010> waves

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
mud and in win it also adds in waves

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.630 
mud and in win it also adds in waves
ripples<00:00:42.090> current<00:00:42.629> etc<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.430> size

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
ripples current etc the way of size

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400 
ripples current etc the way of size
depends<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> intensity<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> wind<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
depends on the intensity of the wind and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.490 
depends on the intensity of the wind and
also<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> area<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> water<00:00:48.050> okay<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.379> now

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
also the area of the water okay so now

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.840 
also the area of the water okay so now
that<00:00:49.530> we've<00:00:49.770> looked<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.399> new<00:00:50.520> forms

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that we've looked into the new forms

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.310 
that we've looked into the new forms
whether<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> look<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
whether it's time to have a look and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
whether it's time to have a look and
play<00:00:52.559> around<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> new<00:00:53.340> items<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> adds

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
play around with the new items it adds

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
play around with the new items it adds
in<00:00:54.289> now<00:00:55.289> these<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:55.710> items<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.520> tornado

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in now these two items are the tornado

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.049 
in now these two items are the tornado
siren<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.480> tornado<00:00:57.989> sensor<00:00:58.760> basically<00:00:59.760> what

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
siren and tornado sensor basically what

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
siren and tornado sensor basically what
the<00:01:00.149> tornado<00:01:00.449> sensor<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.320> senses<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the tornado sensor does it senses when a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
the tornado sensor does it senses when a
tornado<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.579> approaching<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.539> tornado

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
tornado is approaching and on tornado

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.130 
tornado is approaching and on tornado
siren<00:01:04.260> goes<00:01:04.409> off<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> tornado<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.610> around

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
siren goes off when a tornado is around

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
siren goes off when a tornado is around
now<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.560> using<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.130> items<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.610> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
