00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
of the B string it's a hammer-on

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
of the B string it's a hammer-on
pull-off<00:00:22.980> onto<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> third<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:26.789> go<00:00:26.939> 2nd<00:00:27.720> 3rd

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
pull-off onto the third you go 2nd 3rd

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.479 
pull-off onto the third you go 2nd 3rd
2nd<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.310> open<00:00:30.859> just<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> do
