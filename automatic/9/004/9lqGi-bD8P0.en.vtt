but I don't like gaps here because it's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
small holes so what I did was decided to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.330 
small holes so what I did was decided to
use<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.579> other<00:01:41.729> holes<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> used<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.130> hole

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
use the other holes so I used the hole

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.889 
use the other holes so I used the hole
in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> front<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.799> hole<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
in the front the hole in the back and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.230 
in the front the hole in the back and
add<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.649> lanyard<00:01:50.250> hole

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.810 

also<00:01:54.170> what<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.380> did<00:01:54.590> was<00:01:54.830> cut<00:01:55.130> off<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.460> blank<00:01:55.670> a

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
also what I did was cut off the blank a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.650 
also what I did was cut off the blank a
bit<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:57.110> rounded<00:01:57.560> all<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.130> curves

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
bit I just rounded all the curves

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.450 
bit I just rounded all the curves
because<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.690> think<00:01:59.870> it<00:02:00.530> feels<00:02:00.830> better<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:01.280> my

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
because I think it feels better in my

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.150 
because I think it feels better in my
hands<00:02:01.940> at<00:02:02.030> least<00:02:05.470> if<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.620> look<00:02:06.650> at<00:02:06.950> the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
hands at least if you look at the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.590 
hands at least if you look at the
original<00:02:07.400> one<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.179> see<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:08.810> quite<00:02:09.140> pointy

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
original one you see it's quite pointy

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.320 
original one you see it's quite pointy
here<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:15.020> don't<00:02:15.230> really<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.740> it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
here and here and I don't really like it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.810 
here and here and I don't really like it
it's<00:02:17.330> okay<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.100> well<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.340> could<00:02:19.520> be<00:02:19.640> better

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
it's okay but well it could be better

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.300 
it's okay but well it could be better
for<00:02:20.630> my<00:02:20.810> hands<00:02:21.080> at<00:02:21.290> least<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.740> have<00:02:21.860> medium

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
for my hands at least and I have medium

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.570 
for my hands at least and I have medium
to<00:02:22.340> large<00:02:22.790> hands<00:02:26.290> also<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:29.300> point<00:02:29.600> here<00:02:30.170> I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
to large hands also the point here I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.010 
to large hands also the point here I
removed<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:32.650> made<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.770> flat<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:35.600> much<00:02:35.750> better

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
removed this made it flat so much better

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.820 
removed this made it flat so much better
to<00:02:36.170> choke<00:02:36.410> up<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.800> blade<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:38.200> use<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.440> black

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
to choke up the blade I use the black

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.020 
to choke up the blade I use the black
lines<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:44.290> also<00:02:45.290> because<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.890> my<00:02:46.100> reduction

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
lines and also because of my reduction

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.680 
lines and also because of my reduction
of<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:48.340> handle<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.790> reduction<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.540> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
of the handle and the reduction of the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.130 
of the handle and the reduction of the
blank<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.790> cut<00:02:52.790> off<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.120> bit<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.600> length<00:02:53.900> of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
blank I cut off a bit of the length of

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.220 
blank I cut off a bit of the length of
the<00:02:54.350> handle<00:02:55.250> actually<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:57.410> much<00:02:59.230> but

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
the handle actually not much but

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.289 
the handle actually not much but
sufficient<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.360> do<00:03:02.420> really<00:03:02.870> like<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:04.090> ran<00:03:05.090> it

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
off here also just so here it's a bit

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.170 
off here also just so here it's a bit
rounded<00:03:08.480> off<00:03:08.660> he<00:03:08.900> was<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.049> bit<00:03:09.260> rounded<00:03:09.650> off<00:03:09.830> and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180

by<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.019> way<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.410> used<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.489> really<00:03:28.610> strong<00:03:29.000> glue

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
by the way I used a really strong glue

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.970 
by the way I used a really strong glue
it's<00:03:29.570> Industrials<00:03:30.530> trying<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.340> do<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:33.530> proxy

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
it's Industrials trying to do it proxy

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's Industrials trying to do it proxy
glue<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:36.010> used<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.340> lot<00:03:38.049> all<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.110> gaps<00:03:40.100> in<00:03:40.489> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
glue I used a lot all the gaps in the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
glue I used a lot all the gaps in the
skeletonized<00:03:42.730> blade<00:03:43.730> i<00:03:44.500> totally<00:03:45.500> fill<00:03:45.739> them

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
skeletonized blade i totally fill them

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.729 
skeletonized blade i totally fill them
up<00:03:46.040> with<00:03:46.100> glue<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> one<00:03:48.470> piece

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
up with glue so this is a one piece

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.509 
up with glue so this is a one piece
construction<00:03:49.060> naturally<00:03:50.060> now<00:03:51.519> inside

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
construction naturally now inside

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.509 
construction naturally now inside
there's<00:03:52.850> no<00:03:53.060> holes<00:03:53.390> left<00:03:53.720> everything<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.769> glue

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
there's no holes left everything is glue

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.090 
there's no holes left everything is glue
or<00:03:55.850> liner<00:03:56.420> or<00:03:56.989> handle<00:03:57.650> g10<00:03:58.310> points

or liner or handle g10 points

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.760 
or liner or handle g10 points
so<00:04:02.100> during<00:04:02.520> my<00:04:02.990> using<00:04:03.990> this<00:04:04.110> knife<00:04:04.350> because
