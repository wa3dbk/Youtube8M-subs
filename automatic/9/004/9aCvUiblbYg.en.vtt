00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.970 

what's<00:00:51.140> neat<00:00:51.440> about<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:52.570> if<00:00:53.650> you<00:00:54.650> want<00:00:54.830> to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
probably about the same year it's the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.130 
probably about the same year it's the
black<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:01.070> believe<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.720> you<00:01:02.809> can<00:01:02.960> put<00:01:03.110> your

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
black I believe so you can put your

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.430 
black I believe so you can put your
groceries<00:01:03.710> or<00:01:03.920> your<00:01:04.070> books<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.549> there<00:01:06.909> also

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
groceries or your books in there also

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.430 
groceries or your books in there also
let's<00:01:09.440> see<00:01:14.920> it's<00:01:15.920> not<00:01:16.070> much<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.520> tell<00:01:16.820> I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
let's see it's not much to tell I

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.590 
let's see it's not much to tell I
believe<00:01:18.440> they<00:01:18.799> were<00:01:18.860> sold<00:01:19.220> by<00:01:19.400> Sears<00:01:19.760> back

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
believe they were sold by Sears back

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.990 
believe they were sold by Sears back
then<00:01:23.979> it's<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.330> two<00:01:26.330> cycle<00:01:26.600> zero<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.760> psycho

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
then it's a two cycle zero to psycho

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.540 
then it's a two cycle zero to psycho
motor<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.940> start<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.480> pedal<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.020> and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
motor and to start it you pedal it and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.920 
motor and to start it you pedal it and
once<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.640> start<00:01:34.910> pedaling<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:35.480> pull<00:01:35.720> this

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
once you start pedaling you pull this

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.550 
once you start pedaling you pull this
lever<00:01:36.200> here<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:38.450> engages<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.290> drive

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
lever here and that engages the drive

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.030 
lever here and that engages the drive
system<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.460> motor<00:01:40.670> starts<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.890> gas

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
system and then the motor starts the gas

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.810 
system and then the motor starts the gas
tank<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.610> built<00:01:43.850> into<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.240> frame<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:45.820> believe

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
tank is built into the frame I believe

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.070 
tank is built into the frame I believe
it<00:01:47.000> holds<00:01:47.300> about<00:01:47.480> two<00:01:47.750> quarts<00:01:49.660> I've<00:01:50.660> been<00:01:50.900> I

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
it holds about two quarts I've been I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.810 
it holds about two quarts I've been I
guess<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.560> get<00:01:51.680> about<00:01:51.890> 100<00:01:52.280> miles<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
guess you get about 100 miles to the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.380 
guess you get about 100 miles to the
gallon<00:01:53.000> give<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.630> mix<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> gas<00:01:54.140> yes<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.770> do

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
gallon give to mix the gas yes you do

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.690 
gallon give to mix the gas yes you do
fifty<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.480> one<00:01:56.680> just<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.800> say<00:01:57.980> uh<00:01:58.010> that's<00:01:58.550> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
fifty to one just to say uh that's a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.810 
fifty to one just to say uh that's a
cutoff<00:01:59.240> switch<00:01:59.510> there<00:01:59.780> yeah<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.820> kill

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
cutoff switch there yeah this is a kill

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.700 
cutoff switch there yeah this is a kill
switch

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
switch

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.820 
switch
actually<00:02:03.710> my<00:02:03.860> son<00:02:03.920> drove<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.350> he<00:02:06.350> didn't

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
actually my son drove it a and he didn't

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.100 
actually my son drove it a and he didn't
have<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.010> license<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.569> kind<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.899> neat

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
have a license so it was kind of neat

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.229 
have a license so it was kind of neat
he'd<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.830> driving<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.789> can<00:02:10.970> still

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
he'd be driving it and you can still

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.009 
he'd be driving it and you can still
work<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.110> pedals<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.769> you<00:02:13.700> know<00:02:14.269> if<00:02:14.390> some

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
work the pedals and you know if some

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.610 
work the pedals and you know if some
officer<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.220> law<00:02:16.370> came<00:02:16.730> by<00:02:17.260> he<00:02:18.260> could<00:02:18.440> hit

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
officer of the law came by he could hit

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.400 
officer of the law came by he could hit
this<00:02:18.800> with<00:02:19.010> his<00:02:19.220> foot<00:02:19.519> or<00:02:19.909> with

this with his foot or with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.260 
this with his foot or with
so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.040 
so
see<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.500> fast<00:02:25.710> does<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:25.980> go<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.720> tricky

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
see how fast does it go it's a tricky

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.570 
see how fast does it go it's a tricky
question<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.920> wait<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> slower

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
question the more you wait a slower

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.400 
question the more you wait a slower
course<00:02:29.940> how<00:02:30.180> fast<00:02:30.450> does<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.630> go<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.110> with

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
course how fast does it go with you with
