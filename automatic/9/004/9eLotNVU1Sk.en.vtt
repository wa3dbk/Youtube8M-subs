one<00:04:30.750> thing<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.050> think<00:04:31.110> we're<00:04:31.350> really<00:04:31.500> noticing

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
one thing I think we're really noticing

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.490 
one thing I think we're really noticing
is<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.639> it's<00:04:32.880> quiet<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.509> here<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:34.320> when<00:04:34.440> you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
is that it's quiet in here that when you

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.230 
is that it's quiet in here that when you
have<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.860> stereo<00:04:35.280> off<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.729> we<00:04:35.820> loved<00:04:36.090> it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
have the stereo off and we loved it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.749 
have the stereo off and we loved it
before<00:04:36.660> it's<00:04:37.470> quiet<00:04:37.860> enough<00:04:38.009> to<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.550> relax

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
before it's quiet enough to just relax

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:54.709 
before it's quiet enough to just relax
and<00:04:39.570> enjoy<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.930> ride<00:04:40.139> I'm<00:04:40.949> so<00:04:41.220> relaxed
