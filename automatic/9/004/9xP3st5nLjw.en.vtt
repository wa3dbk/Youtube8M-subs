00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
apparently in this story and how he has

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.740 
apparently in this story and how he has
to<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.130> come<00:02:09.399> together<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:09.880> his<00:02:10.030> friends

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
to like come together with his friends

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.470 
to like come together with his friends
and<00:02:10.960> realize<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.680> it's<00:02:11.950> not<00:02:12.010> alone<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.910> they

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and realize that it's not alone and they

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.670 
and realize that it's not alone and they
have<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.780> fight<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:14.170> monster<00:02:14.350> together

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
have to like fight this monster together

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.070 
have to like fight this monster together
and<00:02:15.160> that's<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> end<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:16.510> doesn't<00:02:16.630> really<00:02:16.900> end

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and that's the end it doesn't really end

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.530 
and that's the end it doesn't really end
because<00:02:17.470> they<00:02:17.650> don't<00:02:17.830> actually<00:02:17.980> see<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
because they don't actually see the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.700 
because they don't actually see the
monster<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.640> kind<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.000> weird<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.650> I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
monster so it's kind of weird and I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.770 
monster so it's kind of weird and I
don't<00:02:23.740> think<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.480> another

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
don't think I like that so another

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.740 
don't think I like that so another
negative<00:02:26.050> besides<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.980> terrible<00:02:27.490> ending<00:02:27.820> was

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
negative besides the terrible ending was

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.980 
negative besides the terrible ending was
that<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.140> stories<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:29.920> seem<00:02:30.190> kind<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.790> short

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
that the stories all seem kind of short

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.350 
that the stories all seem kind of short
like<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.410> feel<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:33.790> shouldn't<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.120> been<00:02:34.210> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
like I feel they shouldn't have been a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.960 
like I feel they shouldn't have been a
little<00:02:34.630> bit<00:02:34.810> longer<00:02:35.110> or<00:02:35.560> at<00:02:36.100> least<00:02:36.280> explains<00:02:36.820> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
little bit longer or at least explains a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.240 
little bit longer or at least explains a
little<00:02:37.090> bit<00:02:37.270> more<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:38.350> example<00:02:38.770> one<00:02:38.920> wonder

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
little bit more for example one wonder

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.510 
little bit more for example one wonder
girl<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.790> speedy<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> date<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.530> just

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
girl and speedy go on a date it's just

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.400 
girl and speedy go on a date it's just
kind<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.760> roughly<00:02:43.060> ends<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.140> seems<00:02:44.350> like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
kind of roughly ends and it seems like

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.630 
kind of roughly ends and it seems like
they're<00:02:44.590> never<00:02:44.740> gonna<00:02:44.920> talk<00:02:45.220> each<00:02:45.490> other

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
they're never gonna talk each other

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.460 
they're never gonna talk each other
again<00:02:45.940> which<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.480> guess<00:02:46.660> they<00:02:46.840> don't<00:02:47.020> because

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
again which I guess they don't because

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.080 
again which I guess they don't because
it's<00:02:47.740> obviously<00:02:48.070> not<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:50.440> Titans<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.790> and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it's obviously not in the Titans so and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.570 
it's obviously not in the Titans so and
he's<00:02:52.180> not<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.570> last<00:02:53.220> chapter<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.430> the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
he's not in the last chapter of the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.070 
he's not in the last chapter of the
books<00:02:54.760> either<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.920> guess<00:02:56.920> everybody<00:02:57.520> eats

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
books either so I guess everybody eats

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.780 
books either so I guess everybody eats
