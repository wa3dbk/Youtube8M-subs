00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.349
 complaints have appeared since Sunday 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.820
 videos or photographs that insinuated or 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.919
 who accused the pri of having bought 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.870
 votes we are talking about videos in the 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.639
 that showed people saying that the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.320
 Pri had given them cards to 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.900
 exchange in a supermarket in exchange 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.119
 of pri votes you can put the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.609
 hand in the fire and say that the pri no 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.789
 has paid for not a single vote in this 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.850
 presidential election totally 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.090
 totally 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.680
 it is true that the party was attached to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.790
 right that a process followed 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.670
 transparent and that the party invested 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.950
 during this campaign what the law 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.379
 lets that we were the party that 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.870
 first demanded the inspection of the 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.640
 resources invested in this process by 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.290
 part of the electoral authority and the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.870
 own electoral authority will have to 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.510
 issue a report on the audit 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.449
 that has made all the matches 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.210
 politicians this signaling is not new 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.059
 I am very sorry that the expression of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.770
 who was a candidate of the left in 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.180
 our country does not recognize the result and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 less 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.410
 do not decide on the institutional channels 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.230
 it seems to me that there has not been in the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.690
 democratic history of mexico a 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.640
 process with these characteristics with 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.780
 these conditions are worth recognizing 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.420
 and pick up the expressions that the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.200
 former president gaviria of colombia as 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.210
 head of the observer commission 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.229
 elections try to apologize that the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.990
 interrupt press that these accusations 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.330
 he is not doing them only Lopez 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.710
 there are independent citizens 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.660
 that have nothing to do with that party 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.979
 who are saying that they were paid 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.840
 directly cards for a 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.460
 supermarket to change them and that there was 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.979
 been the pri and there are videos that indicate 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.659
 it's look at this type of games because you can 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.520
 be as armed as 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.649
 indicated by who is doing this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.990
 kind of vigo wardrobe that been because 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.829
 this kind of signs so I 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.560
 it seems that any test you have 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.440
 is present is not on your server 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.810
 issue neither qualification judgments nor 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.370
 make valuation to videos that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.940
 eventually they introduce themselves to us 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.010
 he who speaks to the respondent who 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.260
 tells you that these videos are not 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.810
 armed by the adversaries themselves what 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.269
 credibility have I would put it in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.209
 doubt as surely many can 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.760
 eventually doubt the validity or 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 the authenticity or legitimacy that they have 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.750
 this kind of testimonials if there are tests 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.569
 convincing 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.110
 submit to the legal authority that 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.110
 correspond
