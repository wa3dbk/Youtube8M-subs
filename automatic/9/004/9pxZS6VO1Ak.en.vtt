00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.910
 good fish tips on here with a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.769
 house is very interesting for those who have 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 iphone and mirror your device ne 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.609
 on tv that has a bug in smart tv 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 no to itv on the own notebook on own 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.060
 computer you need a program 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.119
 called reflector reflector is a 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.610
 program for windows or mac right and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.489
 this mirroring function only works 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.059
 in the square iphone 5 565 s 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 because you are the only device that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:49.289
 have aa airplay function nÃ© 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 You need to activate airplay to be able to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.140
 make this program run version 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 his 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 we can only record for 10 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.719
 minutes 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.640
 so I 'll teach you how you 're registering 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.979
 he sure so here are two sites 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 trustworthy that I will put la na na 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.720
 channel description 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.619
 the file is in these two dropbox 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.590
 sakineh and sound of two gringo users 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.250
 the 32-bit version of your system 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.610
 operable windows and another for if 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.049
 64-bit 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.070
 done that you will open the program 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.579
 usually from here to make a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.579
 test 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:48.030
 the euro opened here today just activate the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 right airplay 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:02.479
 and here I think he will not give up 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:07.450
 because I have the deep exchange not 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.450
 I opened to go there too. 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.400
 then this is the version registered in 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.650
 typical right 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.180
 in case here on iphone 5 is just mine 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.260
 You may be doing this and 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.680
 registering your body you are able to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.040
 use your iphone 5 's 15 scene that the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.160
 same thing of the five then that's it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.610
 Ricardo Fish is here and until 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.610
