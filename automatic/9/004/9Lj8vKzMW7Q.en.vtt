this<00:02:04.149> whole<00:02:04.329> thing<00:02:04.539> does<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:05.109> somewhat<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.920> a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
this whole thing does have somewhat of a

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.340 
this whole thing does have somewhat of a
modular<00:02:06.880> build<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.630> there's<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.990> section

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
modular build to it there's a section

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.229 
modular build to it there's a section
here<00:02:08.619> where<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:08.979> easily<00:02:09.310> pull<00:02:09.849> off<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
here where you can easily pull off the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.350 
here where you can easily pull off the
bottom<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
bottom of the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.390 
bottom of the
maybe<00:02:11.690> not<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.990> easily<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:13.160> pull

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
maybe not that easily but you can pull

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.430 
maybe not that easily but you can pull
up<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.760> bottom<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.360> frame<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:15.290> see

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
up the bottom of the frame you can see

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.890 
up the bottom of the frame you can see
that<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.340> how<00:02:16.640> they<00:02:17.270> get<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
that this is just how they get the the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.660 
that this is just how they get the the
wheels<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.410> there<00:02:18.620> everything<00:02:19.070> appears<00:02:19.400> just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
wheels on there everything appears just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.510 
wheels on there everything appears just
attached<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:20.990> rear<00:02:21.380> section<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.070> also

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
attached but this rear section is also

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.210 
attached but this rear section is also
removable<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.270> they<00:02:23.690> give<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.410> instead

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
removable and they give you this instead

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.830 
removable and they give you this instead
this<00:02:25.640> gives<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> little<00:02:26.240> bit<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.480> extra

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
this gives you a little bit of extra

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.870 
this gives you a little bit of extra
clearance<00:02:27.410> underneath<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.430> can<00:02:28.550> see<00:02:28.580> gives

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
clearance underneath you can see gives

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.590 
clearance underneath you can see gives
you<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.030> different<00:02:29.210> style<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.700> chair<00:02:31.700> or<00:02:31.970> seat

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
you a different style of a chair or seat

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.120 
you a different style of a chair or seat
back<00:02:32.900> there<00:02:32.930> which<00:02:33.380> actually<00:02:33.740> works<00:02:33.920> better

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
back there which actually works better

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.660 
back there which actually works better
with<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.640> smaller<00:02:35.360> figures<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.670> child

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
with the smaller figures with the child

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.340 
with the smaller figures with the child
sized<00:02:37.970> figures<00:02:38.420> they<00:02:38.540> can<00:02:38.660> hold<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
sized figures they can hold on to the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.590 
sized figures they can hold on to the
sides<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.610> also<00:02:40.820> gives<00:02:41.150> extra

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
sides but this also gives extra

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.650 
sides but this also gives extra
clearance<00:02:41.870> underneath<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.980> attach<00:02:43.700> an<00:02:43.970> RC

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
clearance underneath to attach an RC

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.840 
clearance underneath to attach an RC
module<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:45.890> actually<00:02:46.190> fully

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
module so you can actually fully

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.550 
module so you can actually fully
instrument<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:47.930> car<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.530> be

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
instrument this car to be

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.650 
instrument this car to be
remote-controlled<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
remote-controlled if you have the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.260 
remote-controlled if you have the
separately<00:02:51.320> available<00:02:51.440> RC<00:02:52.310> system<00:02:52.760> there's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
separately available RC system there's

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.840 
separately available RC system there's
what<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.690> vehicle<00:02:54.110> looks<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.740> from<00:02:55.160> outside

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
what the vehicle looks like from outside

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.900 
what the vehicle looks like from outside
with<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.930> different<00:02:57.800> inner<00:02:57.980> piece<00:02:58.340> put<00:02:58.790> in

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
with that different inner piece put in

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.430 
with that different inner piece put in
there<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.510> can<00:02:59.630> see<00:02:59.780> how<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.959> seats<00:03:00.260> are<00:03:00.410> a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
there so you can see how the seats are a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.350 
there so you can see how the seats are a
little<00:03:00.620> bit<00:03:00.770> raised<00:03:01.490> up<00:03:01.880> but<00:03:02.060> they<00:03:02.150> look<00:03:02.330> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
little bit raised up but they look a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.330 
little bit raised up but they look a
little<00:03:02.480> bit<00:03:02.660> different<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.830> also<00:03:03.980> takes

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
little bit different and this also takes

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.730 
little bit different and this also takes
away<00:03:04.520> some<00:03:04.880> space<00:03:05.240> from<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.110> trunk<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.680> order

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
away some space from the trunk in order

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.000 
away some space from the trunk in order
to<00:03:06.950> leave<00:03:07.610> enough<00:03:07.880> room<00:03:07.970> for<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:09.010> motor

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
to leave enough room for the motor

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.830 
to leave enough room for the motor
system<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.850> electronics<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.660> back

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
system and the electronics in the back

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.199 
system and the electronics in the back
there's<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.830> closer<00:03:13.100> look<00:03:13.459> at<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.880> two

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
there's that closer look at the two

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.960 
there's that closer look at the two
people<00:03:14.630> it's<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.380> father<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.340> daughter<00:03:16.519> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.449 
and he's got print that goes all the way
around<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.570> back<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.959> his<00:03:33.080> is<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.590> jacket<00:03:34.370> or

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
around the back of his is a jacket or

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.940 
around the back of his is a jacket or
shirt<00:03:34.519> that's<00:03:35.390> rolled<00:03:35.690> up<00:03:35.870> also<00:03:36.260> has<00:03:36.410> print<00:03:36.769> on

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
shirt that's rolled up also has print on

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.570 
shirt that's rolled up also has print on
the<00:03:37.900> sleeves<00:03:38.900> there<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.650> sides<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.250> then

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
the sleeves there on the sides and then

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.910 
the sleeves there on the sides and then
these<00:03:40.790> pieces<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.390> luggage<00:03:41.720> have<00:03:42.200> wheels<00:03:42.650> so

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
these pieces of luggage have wheels so

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.770 
these pieces of luggage have wheels so
they<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.190> actually<00:03:43.310> be<00:03:43.519> wheeled<00:03:43.880> around<00:03:44.090> you

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
they can actually be wheeled around you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.509 
they can actually be wheeled around you
can<00:03:44.870> see<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.170> they<00:03:45.320> do<00:03:45.380> have<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.220> little

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
can see that they do have the little

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.670 
can see that they do have the little
hand<00:03:46.820> holds<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.360> them<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.810> can<00:03:47.959> have<00:03:48.440> this

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
hand holds on them so you can have this

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.130 
hand holds on them so you can have this
kind<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.070> being<00:03:49.310> dragged<00:03:49.910> behind<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.989> put

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
kind of being dragged behind just put

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.960 
kind of being dragged behind just put
that<00:03:51.290> into<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.739> hand<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.040> your<00:03:52.190> figure<00:03:52.519> like

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that into the hand of your figure like

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.540 
that into the hand of your figure like
that<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.540> it's<00:03:54.080> probably<00:03:54.290> best<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.709> turn<00:03:55.430> it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
that and it's probably best to turn it

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.100 
that and it's probably best to turn it
that<00:03:55.760> way<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.330> you've<00:03:56.480> still<00:03:56.840> got<00:03:56.959> the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
that way so that you've still got the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.150 
that way so that you've still got the
wheels<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.800> ground

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
wheels on the ground

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.310 
wheels on the ground
and<00:03:58.250> each<00:03:58.580> of<00:03:58.730> these<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:59.450> be<00:03:59.630> opened<00:04:00.050> up<00:04:00.170> so

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
and each of these can be opened up so

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.110 
and each of these can be opened up so
you<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.500> actually<00:04:00.620> put<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.519> little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:01.910> of

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
you can actually put a little bit of

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.550 
you can actually put a little bit of
stuff<00:04:02.390> inside<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.140> there<00:04:03.260> because<00:04:03.440> they're

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
stuff inside of there because they're

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.290 
stuff inside of there because they're
two<00:04:04.040> pieces<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:04.640> they're<00:04:04.760> hollow<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.269> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
two pieces and they're hollow on the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.110 
two pieces and they're hollow on the
inside<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:05.959> just<00:04:06.440> very<00:04:06.650> small<00:04:07.070> things<00:04:07.370> but<00:04:07.640> you

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
inside so just very small things but you

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.690 
inside so just very small things but you
know<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.299> does<00:04:08.630> make<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> little<00:04:09.350> bit

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
know it does make it a little bit

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.100 
know it does make it a little bit
utilitarian<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.790> can<00:04:10.940> put<00:04:11.090> your<00:04:11.239> small<00:04:11.810> toys

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
utilitarian you can put your small toys

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.320 
there
pretty<00:04:15.650> straightforward<00:04:16.040> wholesome<00:04:17.000> set

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
pretty straightforward wholesome set

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.390 
pretty straightforward wholesome set
it's<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.870> nice<00:04:18.200> looking<00:04:18.560> vehicle<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:19.040> wish<00:04:19.190> that

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
it's a nice looking vehicle I wish that

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.580 
it's a nice looking vehicle I wish that
it<00:04:19.549> had<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.120> little<00:04:20.660> bit<00:04:20.780> more<00:04:20.959> detailing

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
it had just a little bit more detailing

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.340 
it had just a little bit more detailing
down<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:21.979> sides<00:04:22.400> with<00:04:22.880> just<00:04:23.539> some<00:04:23.840> some

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
down the sides with just some some

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.580 
down the sides with just some some
simulated<00:04:25.010> seam

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
simulated seam

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.409 
simulated seam
for<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.950> doors<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.090> little<00:04:27.240> bit

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
for the doors it's just a little bit

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.840 
for the doors it's just a little bit
plain<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.620> sides<00:04:28.889> for<00:04:29.220> me<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.639> rest

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
plain on the sides for me but the rest

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.830 
plain on the sides for me but the rest
of<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.210> pretty<00:04:30.480> good

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
of it is pretty good

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.659 
of it is pretty good
I<00:04:30.870> really<00:04:31.560> appreciate<00:04:31.950> every<00:04:32.190> time<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.490> they

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
I really appreciate every time that they

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.490 
I really appreciate every time that they
make<00:04:33.180> one<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.450> these<00:04:33.570> vehicles<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:34.200> allow

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
make one of these vehicles that allow

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.650 
make one of these vehicles that allow
you<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.770> use<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.250> RC<00:04:35.610> system<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.270> if<00:04:36.480> you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
you to use the RC system so that if you

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.900 
you to use the RC system so that if you
have<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.200> then<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.860> can<00:04:38.010> make<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.370> go<00:04:38.400> although

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
have it then you can make it go although

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.000 
have it then you can make it go although
of<00:04:39.300> course<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.720> system<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.260> relatively

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
of course that system is relatively

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.830 
of course that system is relatively
expensive<00:04:41.310> itself<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:42.510> becomes<00:04:42.750> very

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
expensive itself so it becomes very

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.810 
expensive itself so it becomes very
expensive<00:04:43.770> if<00:04:43.919> you<00:04:44.250> want<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.580> multiple

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
expensive if you want to have multiple

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.240 
expensive if you want to have multiple
vehicles<00:04:45.450> that<00:04:45.930> are<00:04:46.020> set<00:04:46.200> up<00:04:46.230> like<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
vehicles that are set up like that the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.370 
vehicles that are set up like that the
two<00:04:47.639> figures<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.330> they<00:04:48.450> include<00:04:48.840> here<00:04:49.230> I

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
two figures that they include here I

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.590 
two figures that they include here I
look<00:04:49.770> like<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:49.980> little<00:04:50.190> bit<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.639> mismatch<00:04:50.940> but

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
look like a little bit of a mismatch but

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
look like a little bit of a mismatch but
that's<00:04:51.960> all<00:04:52.169> good

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
that's all good

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.890 
that's all good
that's<00:04:52.950> something<00:04:53.610> that's<00:04:53.760> common<00:04:54.389> amongst

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
that's something that's common amongst

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.050 
that's something that's common amongst
families<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.440> get<00:04:55.590> some<00:04:55.830> variety<00:04:56.190> going<00:04:56.940> on

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
families you get some variety going on

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.310 
families you get some variety going on
there<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.389> it's<00:04:57.480> good<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:57.720> they<00:04:57.990> give<00:04:58.200> you

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
there and it's good that they give you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.719 
there and it's good that they give you
some<00:04:58.530> luggage<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.070> there's<00:04:59.370> plenty<00:04:59.550> of

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
some luggage and there's plenty of

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.940 
some luggage and there's plenty of
storage<00:05:00.000> space<00:05:00.150> altogether<00:05:00.660> with<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.440> so

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
storage space altogether with this so

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.670 
storage space altogether with this so
kids<00:05:02.250> who<00:05:02.400> really<00:05:02.639> want<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.090> play<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.620> know

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
kids who really want to play you know
