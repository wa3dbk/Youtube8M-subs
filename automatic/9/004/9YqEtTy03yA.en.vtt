00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
just it if you put a regular board in it

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.250 
just it if you put a regular board in it
and<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:10.170> HD<00:02:11.009> heater<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:12.239> need<00:02:12.450> H

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and it's HD heater you need H

boy<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:14.159> where<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.519> man<00:02:14.730> had<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> problem<00:02:15.420> I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
boy that's where the man had a problem I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.009 
boy that's where the man had a problem I
kept<00:02:16.500> shutting<00:02:16.830> off<00:02:17.189> on<00:02:17.519> them<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.720> he<00:02:18.840> had

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
kept shutting off on them I think he had

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.059 
kept shutting off on them I think he had
other<00:02:19.230> problems<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.909> was<00:02:21.060> HD<00:02:22.019> heater<00:02:22.680> and

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
other problems but it was HD heater and

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.930 
other problems but it was HD heater and
the<00:02:24.060> mechanic<00:02:24.750> put<00:02:25.079> in<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.739> regular<00:02:26.659> board<00:02:27.829> okay

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the mechanic put in a regular board okay

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.199 
the mechanic put in a regular board okay
because<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:31.040> have<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.340> running<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
because if you have it running and

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.580 
because if you have it running and
either<00:02:33.659> having<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.590> spa<00:02:35.069> will<00:02:36.060> pool<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.379> can

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
either having a spa will pool you can

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.380 
either having a spa will pool you can
ask<00:02:37.829> these<00:02:38.190> heaters<00:02:38.549> for<00:02:39.000> running

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
ask these heaters for running

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.780 
ask these heaters for running
temperatures<00:02:40.049> hope<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.829> guys<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.370> if

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
temperatures hope you guys know that if

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
you're running pool and you push to pull

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.740 
you're running pool and you push to pull
on<00:02:45.840> button<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:47.579> more<00:02:47.609> than<00:02:48.060> three<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.510> five

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
on button for more than three to five

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
on button for more than three to five
seconds<00:02:49.379> you'll<00:02:50.159> come<00:02:50.519> up<00:02:50.549> with<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
seconds you'll come up with a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.390 
seconds you'll come up with a
temperature<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:52.049> that's<00:02:52.650> how<00:02:52.920> you'd<00:02:53.190> also

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
temperature and that's how you'd also

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.199 
temperature and that's how you'd also
diagnose<00:02:54.329> if<00:02:54.709> your<00:02:55.709> flu<00:02:56.190> stack<00:02:56.519> sensor<00:02:57.030> is

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
diagnose if your flu stack sensor is

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.309 
diagnose if your flu stack sensor is
working<00:02:57.720> or<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.769> need<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> new<00:02:59.340> board<00:03:00.319> now

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
working or you need a new board now

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.890 
working or you need a new board now
let's<00:03:01.739> we<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.790> know<00:03:02.909> but<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.269> would<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:03.720> want

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
let's we you know but I would just want

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.500 
let's we you know but I would just want
to<00:03:03.989> talk<00:03:04.170> about<00:03:04.200> differences<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.370> heaters<00:03:05.879> so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
to talk about differences on heaters so

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.319 
to talk about differences on heaters so

you<00:03:12.329> know<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> lot<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.870> these<00:03:13.200> components<00:03:14.010> are

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
you know a lot of these components are

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.500 
you know a lot of these components are
reusable<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.040> larger<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
reusable just because it is a larger a

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.229 
reusable just because it is a larger a
smaller<00:03:21.510> heater<00:03:22.340> doesn't<00:03:23.340> mean<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.970> can't

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
smaller heater doesn't mean you can't

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.069 
smaller heater doesn't mean you can't
use<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.599> lot<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.230> components<00:03:25.919> like<00:03:26.160> fennels

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
use a lot of the components like fennels

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
not there much different but 11 I tapped

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.819 
not there much different but 11 I tapped

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
a flu stack sensor um error okay uh what

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.440 
a flu stack sensor um error okay uh what
you<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.340> ask<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.909> heater<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.570> turn<00:04:21.599> on

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
you can do is ask the heater to turn on

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.980 
you can do is ask the heater to turn on
and<00:04:23.540> push<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:25.010> pool<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.790> button<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.540> hold<00:04:26.780> it

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and push the pool on button and hold it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.710 
and push the pool on button and hold it
down<00:04:27.230> for<00:04:27.530> three<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.860> five<00:04:28.070> seconds<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.910> that

display will read a 0 ver it will read

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.960 
display will read a 0 ver it will read
in<00:04:36.980> 90<00:04:37.520> usually<00:04:38.330> if<00:04:38.480> it's<00:04:38.690> reading<00:04:39.170> 20<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:40.820> you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
in 90 usually if it's reading 20 if you

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.690 
in 90 usually if it's reading 20 if you
take<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.450> board<00:04:41.810> off<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.860> back<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.430> board

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
take the board off and back to the board

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.330 
take the board off and back to the board
you'll<00:04:44.360> see<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.630> discoloration<00:04:45.410> of<00:04:45.770> preferred

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
you'll see a discoloration of preferred

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.420 
you'll see a discoloration of preferred
spot<00:04:46.720> right<00:04:47.720> about<00:04:47.960> there<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.470> on<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.190> back

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
spot right about there and on the back

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.170 
spot right about there and on the back
side<00:04:49.730> of<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.970> board<00:04:50.290> so<00:04:51.290> what<00:04:52.280> I<00:04:52.310> would<00:04:52.730> do<00:04:52.940> is

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
side of the board so what I would do is

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.600 
side of the board so what I would do is
at<00:04:53.420> that<00:04:53.870> point<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.380> would<00:04:54.440> put<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.800> new<00:04:55.040> board<00:04:55.370> in

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
at that point I would put a new board in

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.550 
at that point I would put a new board in
new<00:04:56.270> flu<00:04:56.570> sac<00:04:56.900> sensor<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.760> seen<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.790> where<00:04:59.560> flu

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
new flu sac sensor I seen it where flu

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.910 
new flu sac sensor I seen it where flu
stock<00:05:00.920> senses<00:05:01.520> of<00:05:01.550> bed<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.480> it's<00:05:03.470> reading

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
stock senses of bed and it's reading

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
stock senses of bed and it's reading
zero<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.970> not<00:05:05.300> usually<00:05:05.690> so<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:07.250> cheaper<00:05:07.730> way

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
zero but not usually so the cheaper way

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.320 
zero but not usually so the cheaper way
to<00:05:07.970> go<00:05:08.780> out<00:05:08.960> if<00:05:09.230> you<00:05:09.260> see<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.860> zero<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.550> the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
to go out if you see that zero is the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.530 
to go out if you see that zero is the
flu<00:05:11.570> stack<00:05:11.900> sensor<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.680> keep<00:05:13.670> in<00:05:13.910> mind<00:05:14.150> when

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
flu stack sensor and keep in mind when

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.920 
flu stack sensor and keep in mind when
you<00:05:14.780> change<00:05:15.440> your<00:05:15.830> flu<00:05:16.100> stack<00:05:16.460> sensor<00:05:17.060> change

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you change your flu stack sensor change
