00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
with so like I said a lot of different

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.980 
with so like I said a lot of different
videos<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> team<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.690> we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
videos that this is a team that we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
videos that this is a team that we
should<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.770> forgot<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.250> mention<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
should be and I forgot to mention that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.200 
should be and I forgot to mention that
this<00:00:21.570> entire<00:00:22.260> season<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:23.670> face<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this entire season we don't face a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.769 
this entire season we don't face a
ranked<00:00:24.960> opponent<00:00:25.369> but<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.210> episode<00:00:27.359> we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
ranked opponent but in this episode we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.830 
ranked opponent but in this episode we
will<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.199> facing<00:00:28.939> USC<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.119> Rick<00:00:30.420> Mars<00:00:30.630> goes

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
will be facing USC as Rick Mars goes

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.400 
will be facing USC as Rick Mars goes
deep<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.529> he's<00:00:31.740> missed<00:00:32.270> by<00:00:33.270> lane<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.780> our

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
deep and he's missed by lane and our

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.799 
deep and he's missed by lane and our
defense<00:00:34.950> allows<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> score<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.180> Colorado

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
defense allows the score from Colorado

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.549 
defense allows the score from Colorado
which<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:38.390> baffling<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:40.050> defense<00:00:40.440> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
which is baffling because our defense is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.729 
which is baffling because our defense is
supposed<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.190> good<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.239> allow<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
supposed to be good and we allow them to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.979 
supposed to be good and we allow them to
put<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.070> offerings<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> 17s<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.510> scenario

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
put our offerings in the 17s in scenario

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.830 
put our offerings in the 17s in scenario
as<00:00:46.289> rigamortis<00:00:46.680> catches<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.340> touchdown

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
as rigamortis catches that touchdown

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.889 
as rigamortis catches that touchdown
right<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> middle<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.680> defense<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
right in the middle of that defense and

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
right in the middle of that defense and
um<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.860> didn't<00:00:53.160> analyze<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.820> cornerback

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
um we didn't analyze the cornerback

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
um we didn't analyze the cornerback
because<00:00:54.570> i<00:00:54.690> forgot<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> replay<00:00:55.710> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
because i forgot to go to the replay so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
because i forgot to go to the replay so
i<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.969> him<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:58.020> wasn't

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
i can get a look at him but he wasn't

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.689 
i can get a look at him but he wasn't
that<00:00:58.620> good<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.980> corner<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.370> drugged<00:00:59.550> Moss

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
corner or a decent guy but definitely

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.800 
corner or a decent guy but definitely
not<00:01:06.540> good<00:01:07.140> enough<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> stop<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.010> moss<00:01:08.310> or

touchdowns<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.420> we're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.720> be

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
touchdowns but I think we're going to be

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.310 
touchdowns but I think we're going to be
in<00:02:00.990> trouble<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.590> face<00:02:01.979> any<00:02:02.899> high<00:02:03.899> scoring

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
in trouble if we face any high scoring

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.460 
in trouble if we face any high scoring
offenses<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.630> we're<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.869> look<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.200> Rick

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
offenses because we're and look at Rick

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.260 
offenses because we're and look at Rick
Moss<00:02:07.710> he's<00:02:07.950> hurt<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.729> he's<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> come

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
Moss he's hurt but he's going to come

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
Moss he's hurt but he's going to come
back<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.630> fourth<00:02:09.840> quarter<00:02:10.020> he<00:02:10.259> missed<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
back in the fourth quarter he missed a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
back in the fourth quarter he missed a
big<00:02:10.830> chunk<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.310> game<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:11.940> catches

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
big chunk of that game that he catches

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.630 
big chunk of that game that he catches
this<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.830> about<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> 45<00:02:14.610> yard

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
this one to get to about the 45 yard

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.520 
this one to get to about the 45 yard
line<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.569> was<00:02:15.690> saying<00:02:15.750> when<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.200> face

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
line but like I was saying when we face

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.589 
line but like I was saying when we face
a<00:02:16.560> team<00:02:17.269> that<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.630> really<00:02:19.530> score<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:21.239> might<00:02:21.450> be

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
a team that can really score we might be

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.390 
a team that can really score we might be
in<00:02:21.690> trouble<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.200> hopefully<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.739> offense<00:02:23.220> can

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
in trouble but hopefully the offense can

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.509 
in trouble but hopefully the offense can
match<00:02:23.610> every<00:02:23.940> score<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.989> have<00:02:25.519> but

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
match every score that they have but

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.210 
match every score that they have but

is a good offerings actually looked at

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.420 
is a good offerings actually looked at
it<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.109> our<00:03:01.320> defense<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.859> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it so our defense is going to have to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
defense will be in trouble even if we

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.709

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:03.749 
have our defense would have been able to

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.480 
have our defense would have been able to
stop<00:07:04.749> one<00:07:05.229> of<00:07:05.349> the<00:07:05.439> top<00:07:05.710> teams<00:07:05.949> in<00:07:06.189> the<00:07:06.310> nation
