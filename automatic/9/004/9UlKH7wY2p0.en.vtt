00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.600
 the silent killer of our 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.430
 times are triglycerides you know how 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.149
 we can help reduce the following 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.149
 watching this video 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.390
 but remember what your grandpa is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.610
 or your grandmothers took moments there is one 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.040
 that I remember and they took porridge oats 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.689
 hot made dishes made accounts 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.640
 my father-in-law is one of the people who 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.000
 continues every day without fail 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.380
 have a cup of oatmeal with milk and 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.360
 that's what has helped him do 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.489
 they cost what I will be also to their 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.840
 seventy-odd years of age second 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.719
 I'm going to introduce myself just so you can see 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.520
 what good is really fine but 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.160
 well I like hot oatmeal 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.219
 so what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.719
 replace it with a glass of oatmeal water 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.640
 with apple in the mornings all the 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.589
 mornings take them and they will see that they 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.179
 they will feel better going to pay our 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.980
 church of the wounded if they have them 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.559
 high and if they are not going to regulate or is not 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.359
 matter this is something that will help them 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.879
 much to the health of our crossing of two 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.540
 high for not everything we need is 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.540
 half an apple 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.250
 and water 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 the Apple 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.050
 we throw in the blender 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 We have two real teaspoons 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.410

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.410

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.200
 the truth 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.020
 and water 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.240
 we liquefy super well 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.160
 It is very important that you serve them without 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.280
 to strain and not to sweeten it or to be 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.600
 make in sweeten use honey can be 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.520
 that with sugar loses all 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.470
