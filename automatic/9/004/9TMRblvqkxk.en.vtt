00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.189
 two men a goal 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.469
 make a new plastic without killing it from renewable resources 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.099
 For years the two inventors have become too loud with a lot 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.070
 experiments what nature offers 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.740
 They have opted for lignin, a substance that comes in the way of the clock 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.929
 the night quite a few 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.210
 We are simple in our test series 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.510
 take a look stuck because it is 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.710
 certain conditions are met, such as high availability 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.600
 consistent quality 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.070
 and other things more 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.660
 the two inventors produce their good plastic in southern Germany 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.520
 in a specially founded company 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.420
 and this is made of the new material called Arboform a luxury 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.450
 treat the Gucci brand for example 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.469
 its heel and sole made of the material are the ITIL elasticity 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 and among the customers is also the carmaker Porsche 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.090
 from the Bayer which about toys 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.650
 to the speaker the new plastic is diverse 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.360
 He comes in different colors 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360
 only knows that does not work 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.740
 the production hall 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.430
 the exact recipe for the flight a good five hours is secret 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.990
 only as much as it contains natural fibers such as flax and hemp 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 The machines with which he is made spray the charm of the Wilhelminian era 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.770
 but the plastic at first still looks like how long has now 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 future potential 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.100
 Jurgen can do that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 Pfitzer still amazed 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.800
 Difficulty was there the speech or Trier at the Greens advises at the graves 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.820
 Fredi Bobic 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.330
 now have female pollster 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.350
 Now we not only have a world premiere pressure on the market 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.350
 or not even want entrepreneurship at all 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.409
 The two inventors always invested when money was there 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.959
 they have a loss for a long time and soon 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:31.579
 Wengen today they employ ten employees and they want even further 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 to grow 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.669
 we have made up very good sales growth 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.019
 We have double-digit growth rates close to the economic crisis 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.459
 the federal government pays new questions to more under pressure 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.039
 always missing 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.099
 in this Warren rose the recipes 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.829
 There are 900 different ones so far 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.359
 Depending on the customer's request, the material is sometimes harder times less 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:12.749
 Of course, nothing works without laboratory tests, for example when it comes to tensile strength 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.180
 or around the melting temperature in at one point is the new plastic 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.099
 the unbeatable he is dismantling was decays before must 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.719
 while conventional plastic locates on MÃ¼hlberger if it is not 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.989
 is recycled 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.909
 Bullet Physics 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.979
 somehow it is not 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.469
 a list of the richest 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.389
 Process interesting price is called the new material a bit more expensive though 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.989
 however, it is optimistic that demand will continue to increase 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.869
 it can only go in that direction 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.489
 that sooner or later 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.199
 Materials the evaluation is made 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.429
 The medium to long-term replacement will be replaced by materials 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.729
 Percent, in principle, every year break for bags are 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.739
 they seem to be on the right path 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.079
 just the two have got the European as the price
