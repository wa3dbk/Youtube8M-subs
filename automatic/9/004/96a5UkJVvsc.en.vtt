00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you choose colors and my advice is to go

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
you choose colors and my advice is to go
into<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.070> closet<00:00:29.130> open<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> what's<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
into your closet open it and what's the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.269 
into your closet open it and what's the
first<00:00:31.019> color<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> pops<00:00:31.650> out<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.070> that's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
first color that pops out and that's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.270 
first color that pops out and that's
probably<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.790> favorite<00:00:33.059> color<00:00:33.450> because

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
probably your favorite color because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.530 
probably your favorite color because
intuitively<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> buy<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
intuitively that's what you buy all the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.780 
intuitively that's what you buy all the
time<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.590> need<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> piece<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.370> wire<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
time so you need a piece of wire and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.280 
time so you need a piece of wire and
this<00:00:39.030> piece<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> wire<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.870> about<00:00:42.110> two<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this piece of wire is about two and a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.010 
this piece of wire is about two and a
half<00:00:44.390> two<00:00:45.390> inches<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.610> I<00:00:47.989> determine<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
half two inches so I determine that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.389 
half two inches so I determine that
because<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:51.620> bead<00:00:52.620> goes<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
because the the bead goes on to the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.770 
because the the bead goes on to the
center<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> wire<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
center of the wire and I just want to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.830 
center of the wire and I just want to
make<00:00:54.899> sure<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.379> enough<00:00:55.410> room<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> wrap<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
make sure I have enough room to wrap it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
make sure I have enough room to wrap it
so<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> crimp<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.489> hold

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so I'm going to make the crimp to hold

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.090 
so I'm going to make the crimp to hold
the<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.359> side<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the one side then I'm going to make the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.320 
the one side then I'm going to make the
crimp<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> other<00:01:02.879> side<00:01:03.439> and<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
crimp on the other side and I want to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
crimp on the other side and I want to
make<00:01:06.450> sure<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> same<00:01:08.369> spacing<00:01:10.400> as

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
make sure I do the same spacing as

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.310 
make sure I do the same spacing as
before

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.820 

and<00:01:16.280> aside<00:01:16.730> with<00:01:16.970> both<00:01:17.240> ends<00:01:17.570> I'm<00:01:18.560> going<00:01:18.620> to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
and aside with both ends I'm going to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:33.640 
and aside with both ends I'm going to
make<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.070> loop<00:01:27.550> bring<00:01:28.550> them<00:01:28.700> together<00:01:32.650> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
make the loop bring them together and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.360 
make the loop bring them together and
wrap<00:01:35.320> women's<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.470> little<00:01:36.710> shorter<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.220> I

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
wrap women's a little shorter but I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:47.930 
wrap women's a little shorter but I
think<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.850> have<00:01:38.120> enough<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.780> secure<00:01:39.410> thee

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.050 

the<00:01:48.940> rap<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.070> now<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.280> see<00:01:51.580> how<00:01:51.700> it's<00:01:51.850> all<00:01:52.000> a

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the rap so now you see how it's all a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.670 
the rap so now you see how it's all a
little<00:01:52.450> messed<00:01:52.660> up<00:01:52.840> your<00:01:53.080> loop<00:01:53.290> you're<00:01:53.530> just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
little messed up your loop you're just

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.640 
little messed up your loop you're just
going<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.860> take<00:01:54.250> your<00:01:54.400> round<00:01:54.610> nose<00:01:54.730> pliers<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
going to take your round nose pliers and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.370 
going to take your round nose pliers and
gently<00:01:59.370> reshape<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:01.330> loop<00:02:01.540> by<00:02:01.870> just<00:02:02.110> going

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
gently reshape the loop by just going

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.680 
gently reshape the loop by just going
all<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.680> way<00:02:02.710> around<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:04.020> loop<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.290> get<00:02:06.690> to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
all the way around the loop to get to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.440 
all the way around the loop to get to
reshape<00:02:08.140> your<00:02:08.410> loop<00:02:08.790> and<00:02:09.790> then<00:02:10.150> I'm<00:02:10.180> just

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
reshape your loop and then I'm just

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.310 
reshape your loop and then I'm just
going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> trim<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.470> tail<00:02:16.080> make<00:02:17.080> sure<00:02:17.230> you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
going to trim this tail make sure you

have your safety goggles on when you do

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.440 
have your safety goggles on when you do
that<00:02:20.970> other<00:02:21.970> tail<00:02:22.420> here<00:02:23.940> okay<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.030> need<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.210> turn

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
that other tail here okay I need to turn

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.790 
that other tail here okay I need to turn
that<00:02:25.570> I'm<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.810> going<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:25.990> close<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.620> little

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that I'm just going to close it a little

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.940

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.060 
bit more with my pliers I'm just going
to<00:02:35.980> reshape<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.990> loop<00:02:40.260> basically<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.680> are

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
to reshape the loop basically you are

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.830 
to reshape the loop basically you are
ready<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.700> put<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.420> your<00:02:43.540> ear<00:02:43.720> wire<00:02:48.840> then

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
ready to put it on to your ear wire then

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.900 
ready to put it on to your ear wire then
you're<00:02:50.020> going<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.290> open<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.430> ear<00:02:51.730> wire<00:02:51.940> loop<00:02:52.330> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
you're going to open the ear wire loop a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.949 
you're going to open the ear wire loop a
little<00:02:54.910> piece<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.060> wire<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:55.510> sticking<00:02:55.810> out

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
little piece of wire that's sticking out
