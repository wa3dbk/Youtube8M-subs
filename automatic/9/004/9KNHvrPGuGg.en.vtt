something so I kind of here comes me

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:19.949 
something so I kind of here comes me
high<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:18.329> kind<00:01:19.329> of<00:01:19.450> came<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.749> the<00:01:19.810> conclusion

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
high so I kind of came to the conclusion

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.649 
high so I kind of came to the conclusion
that<00:01:20.649> well<00:01:20.889> maybe<00:01:21.100> that's<00:01:21.369> his<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:22.240> medicine

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
that well maybe that's his the medicine

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.209 
that well maybe that's his the medicine
so<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.079> put<00:01:23.319> one<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.649> glass<00:01:23.859> of<00:01:24.009> water

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
so I put one in a glass of water

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.489 
so I put one in a glass of water
overnight<00:01:24.639> and<00:01:24.999> she<00:01:25.869> weren't<00:01:26.020> enough<00:01:26.259> it

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
overnight and she weren't enough it

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.059 
overnight and she weren't enough it
turned<00:01:26.889> into<00:01:27.039> a<00:01:27.189> ball<00:01:27.459> and<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.789> was<00:01:27.909> thinking

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
turned into a ball and I was thinking

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.359 
turned into a ball and I was thinking
you<00:01:30.069> know<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:31.240> not<00:01:31.569> letting<00:01:31.899> any<00:01:32.289> of<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.829> the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
you know it's not letting any of the the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.739 
you know it's not letting any of the the
white<00:01:33.579> powder<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.209> medicine<00:01:34.599> that's

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
inside so I letting any of that out

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.059 
inside so I letting any of that out
because<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.119> casing<00:01:37.599> is<00:01:37.719> so<00:01:38.429> thick<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.759> know
