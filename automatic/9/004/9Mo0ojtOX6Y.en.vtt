 his mauro puts the termite in a 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.740
 container to season it to pick up 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.290
 well the taste of the seasoning is good to 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.950
 meat marinating for at least four 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.230

 chairs that's left is the spice 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.460
 added an end use oil to sprinkle 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.770
 baking sheet outside is a secret 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.650
 so that the aluminum foil does not 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.390
 does not interfere with the cooking process 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.700
 now you'll know you're ready to go to 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.650
 The ideal oven is for the temperature to 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.160
 at 150 degrees 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.840

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.470
 hours 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.330
 You check coconut drop is cooked right. 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.400
 you shove it in the fork 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.670

 in a refractory 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.170
 it reserves the broth and removes the fat 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.930
 to be alone with the cargo juice 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.550
 for this it gives a thermal shock repair 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.850
 that when placing in the pan with a liquid 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.250
 on ice the fat solidifies 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.500
 takes about 15 minutes as bait 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.980
 wood the cook exits culture 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.320
 sieve mix and carry the fire is now the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.450
 instead of adding the orange juice and 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.850
 Finally, wheat flour is 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.370
