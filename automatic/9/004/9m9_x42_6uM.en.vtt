00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.510

 the school children were cruel 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.760
 none of the girls jumped up to wake me up 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.189
 You know how hard it is there like me alone. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.990
 We have no problems in your time, but since 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.750
 are here because I do not confirm this with 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.299
 the confidence exercises if you stay 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.880
 behind the rock and rock you fall in the arms 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.189
 If you let her catch you, you saw me. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 I said we do not have problems 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:41.369
 my goal was but it was not a 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.520
 tremendous accident there are no accidents 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.110
 strange example people yourself 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.420
 do not run because you chose nothing 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.970
 because you're playing what's here at 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.409
 Late night casting she always stays with me 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.729
 leading to play and told me that I should 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.729
 do and no longer supports this 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.740
 we all have problems 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.740
 you think 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.989
 You can make a stop to it. 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.030
 you bend to the left not 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.470
 could turn right in double 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.360
 right foot beating wrong 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.510
 boys and girls no matter who played 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.650
 Wrong you said that you're ethical. 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.790
 You promised that only the good ones would be. 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.170
 basis of clear set there own 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.600
 millionaires do not know how to dance the problem 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.069
 Both of you are out of sync I 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.860
 I was thinking about giving the soil to you. 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.110
 at the end but now I do not know anymore 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.790
 Do not worry, I was doing it on your 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.580
 therapist and she will leave us in shape 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.910
 It 's just that I 'm not going back to that one. 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.330
 therapist I already marked the second 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:10.790
 consulted or consulted 1 to hear 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.790
 You close the toy in progress. 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.890

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.680
 the assistant, I'm tired, let's go home 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.590
 You 're here for an hour, you know. 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.120
 I'm tired of your arrogance also issued 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.540
 Look who's talking you do not even know 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.540

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.560
 I feel you are angry today 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.430
 You know what makes me furious when 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.989
 finishes the ketchup and mustard on the tractor 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.130
 there is nothing worse than eating without these 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.690
 things 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.650
