performance the wavy discs are there to

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.889 
performance the wavy discs are there to
reduce<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.160> heat<00:00:57.670> in<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.510> breaking<00:00:58.809> process

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
reduce the heat in the breaking process

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.389 
reduce the heat in the breaking process
which<00:00:59.320> gives<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.590> better<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.070> break<00:01:00.250> and

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
which gives you better a break and
