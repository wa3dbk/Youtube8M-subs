00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
what they're for but also next to it you

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.490 
what they're for but also next to it you
have<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:40.110> 3.5<00:03:41.070> millimeter<00:03:41.960> jack<00:03:42.960> so<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.440> you

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
have a 3.5 millimeter jack so that you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.050 
have a 3.5 millimeter jack so that you
can<00:03:43.620> plug<00:03:43.830> in<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.010> cable<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.680> let's<00:03:46.680> see

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
can plug in your cable and let's see

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.210 
can plug in your cable and let's see
here<00:03:48.060> you've<00:03:48.240> got<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> slider<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.800> believe

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
here you've got a slider and I believe

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.850 
here you've got a slider and I believe
this<00:03:50.430> slider<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.060> control<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.660> base<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.770> if

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
this slider is to control the base so if

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.860 
this slider is to control the base so if
it's<00:03:53.010> too<00:03:53.220> much<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.520> can<00:03:53.850> bring<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.210> down<00:03:54.420> or

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
it's too much you can bring it down or

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.920 
it's too much you can bring it down or
put<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.410> up<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.360> let's<00:03:57.360> see<00:03:57.450> what<00:03:57.630> else<00:03:57.660> we've

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
put it up and let's see what else we've

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.700 
put it up and let's see what else we've
got<00:03:57.960> here<00:03:58.560> up<00:03:59.520> top<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:00.600> seems<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.140> be<00:04:01.320> a

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
got here up top there seems to be a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.490 
got here up top there seems to be a
little<00:04:02.160> latch<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.780> take<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.260> ear

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
little latch that you can take the ear

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.490 
little latch that you can take the ear
pads<00:04:04.740> off<00:04:05.160> at<00:04:05.970> least<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.990> this

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
pads off at least for this one and this

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.870 
pads off at least for this one and this
will<00:04:07.680> give<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.950> access<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.990> battery<00:04:10.880> spot

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
will give you access to the battery spot

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.480 
will give you access to the battery spot
so<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.270> can<00:04:12.510> take<00:04:12.960> this<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.980> pop<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.400> in

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
so you can take this just pop it in

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.310 
so you can take this just pop it in
right<00:04:14.670> now

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
right now

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.900 
right now
all<00:04:16.320> right<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:16.799> now<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.100> we've<00:04:17.280> got<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.520> in

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
all right so now if we've got that in

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.110 
all right so now if we've got that in
there<00:04:18.140> let's<00:04:19.140> see<00:04:19.320> what<00:04:19.470> else<00:04:19.620> we've<00:04:19.770> got<00:04:19.799> here

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
there let's see what else we've got here

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.890 
there let's see what else we've got here
and<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.359> close<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.870> up

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and just close it up

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.700

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
of cushion so it's pretty big padding so

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.230

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
that's good

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.600 
that's good
of<00:04:46.240> course<00:04:46.510> these<00:04:46.720> are<00:04:46.780> adjustable<00:04:47.500> not<00:04:48.280> very

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
of course these are adjustable not very

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.850 
of course these are adjustable not very
very<00:04:48.940> adjustable<00:04:49.240> not<00:04:49.600> very<00:04:49.780> long<00:04:50.020> but<00:04:50.710> this

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
very adjustable not very long but this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.890 
very adjustable not very long but this
will<00:04:50.979> definitely<00:04:51.100> work<00:04:51.460> for<00:04:51.940> any<00:04:52.360> sized<00:04:52.630> head

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
will definitely work for any sized head

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.760 
will definitely work for any sized head
I'm<00:04:53.050> sure<00:04:53.460> it's<00:04:54.460> got<00:04:54.699> a<00:04:54.729> pretty<00:04:55.090> interesting

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
I'm sure it's got a pretty interesting

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.260 
I'm sure it's got a pretty interesting
headband<00:04:56.770> it's<00:04:57.760> not<00:04:57.970> your<00:04:58.150> typical<00:05:00.270> cushion

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
headband it's not your typical cushion

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.260 
headband it's not your typical cushion
here<00:05:01.539> because<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.990> has<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.260> ridges<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.270> I'm

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
here because it has these ridges so I'm

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.420 
here because it has these ridges so I'm
interested<00:05:05.110> in<00:05:05.380> seeing<00:05:05.590> how<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.039> little

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
interested in seeing how this little

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.740 
interested in seeing how this little
feel<00:05:06.940> after<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.600> long<00:05:07.810> period<00:05:08.050> of<00:05:08.260> time<00:05:08.699> but<00:05:09.750> it

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
feel after a long period of time but it

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.500 
feel after a long period of time but it
looks<00:05:10.900> like<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.169> can<00:05:11.260> conform<00:05:12.240> pretty<00:05:13.240> nicely

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
looks like it can conform pretty nicely

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.629 
looks like it can conform pretty nicely
to<00:05:14.020> most<00:05:14.889> head<00:05:15.070> shapes<00:05:15.810> though<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:18.039> that<00:05:18.370> and

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
to most head shapes though of that and

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.580 
to most head shapes though of that and
of<00:05:18.910> course<00:05:18.940> at<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.419> top<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.870> says<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.380> says

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
of course at the top it says it says

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.719 
of course at the top it says it says
Skull<00:05:20.919> Candy<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:23.970> that's<00:05:24.970> about<00:05:25.210> it<00:05:25.419> guys<00:05:25.449> the

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
Skull Candy and that's about it guys the

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.279 
Skull Candy and that's about it guys the
band<00:05:27.729> feels<00:05:28.000> pretty<00:05:28.240> thick<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.750> feels<00:05:28.960> like<00:05:29.110> it

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
band feels pretty thick it feels like it

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.020 
band feels pretty thick it feels like it
can<00:05:29.520> definitely<00:05:30.520> withstand<00:05:31.410> withstand<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.530> bit

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
can definitely withstand withstand a bit

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.120 
can definitely withstand withstand a bit
so<00:05:34.030> cool<00:05:34.599> and<00:05:34.900> that's<00:05:35.650> about<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.860> for<00:05:35.979> this
