00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
what's for dinner and while I'm thinking

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.289 
what's for dinner and while I'm thinking
about<00:00:04.859> it<00:00:05.160> if<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.460> guys<00:00:05.609> have<00:00:05.759> missed<00:00:05.940> any

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
about it if you guys have missed any

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.160 
about it if you guys have missed any
past<00:00:06.660> episodes<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.859> did<00:00:08.639> make<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> playlist<00:00:09.179> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
past episodes I did make a playlist and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.549 
past episodes I did make a playlist and
it<00:00:10.290> says<00:00:10.530> what's<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.250> dinner<00:00:11.340> or<00:00:11.960> WFD<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.290> it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it says what's for dinner or WFD on it

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.839 
it says what's for dinner or WFD on it
and<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.740> think<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.980> does<00:00:14.099> say<00:00:14.280> actually<00:00:14.670> what's

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and I think it does say actually what's

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.550 
and I think it does say actually what's
for<00:00:15.089> dinner<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.929> always<00:00:16.080> check<00:00:16.350> that

we didn't know what we wanted to eat we
actually<00:02:42.099> even<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.310> went<00:02:42.639> to<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> grocery

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849

actually even just went to the grocery
and<00:02:43.299> picked<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.629> a<00:02:43.780> few<00:02:43.989> things<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.379> we<00:02:44.469> were

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and picked up a few things that we were

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.129 
and picked up a few things that we were
out<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.340> nothing<00:02:45.879> still<00:02:46.090> sounded<00:02:46.450> good<00:02:46.599> I

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
out of and nothing still sounded good I

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.379 
out of and nothing still sounded good I
had<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.799> pork<00:02:47.980> chops<00:02:48.310> from<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.060> previous

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
had the pork chops from the previous

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.119 
had the pork chops from the previous
target<00:02:49.780> haul<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.349> refrigerator<00:02:50.829> but<00:02:51.010> I'll

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
target haul in the refrigerator but I'll

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.740 
target haul in the refrigerator but I'll
probably<00:02:51.280> freeze<00:02:51.639> those<00:02:51.909> because<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.510> didn't

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
probably freeze those because it didn't

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.839 
probably freeze those because it didn't
sound<00:02:52.930> good<00:02:53.109> to<00:02:53.260> either<00:02:53.439> one<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.620> us<00:02:53.829> so<00:02:54.069> we

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
sound good to either one of us so we

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.460 
sound good to either one of us so we
went<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.150> back-up<00:02:55.510> plan<00:02:55.689> we<00:02:56.079> had<00:02:56.260> these<00:02:56.409> in

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
went the back-up plan we had these in

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.670 
went the back-up plan we had these in
the<00:02:56.739> freezer<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:58.060> usually<00:02:58.659> if<00:02:58.719> we<00:02:58.840> eat<00:02:59.109> frozen

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
the freezer and usually if we eat frozen

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.500 
the freezer and usually if we eat frozen
things<00:02:59.889> we<00:03:00.040> try<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.310> buy<00:03:00.459> Amy's<00:03:00.909> brand<00:03:01.209> just

things we try to buy Amy's brand just

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.170 
things we try to buy Amy's brand just

actually from I think it's a Chilean
wine<00:05:10.889> but<00:05:11.220> it's<00:05:11.430> packaged<00:05:12.060> in<00:05:12.270> Napa<00:05:12.510> but

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
wine but it's packaged in Napa but

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.469 
wine but it's packaged in Napa but
anyway<00:05:13.800> it's<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.160> pinot<00:05:14.430> noir<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.880> course<00:05:15.150> but

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
anyway it's a pinot noir of course but

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.870 
anyway it's a pinot noir of course but
another<00:05:16.070> inexpensive<00:05:17.070> you<00:05:17.220> can<00:05:17.250> get<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.850> know
