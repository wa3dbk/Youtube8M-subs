hey<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.719> today<00:00:01.020> I'm<00:00:01.230> gonna<00:00:01.380> give<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:01.709> a

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
hey guys today I'm gonna give you a

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.470 
hey guys today I'm gonna give you a
tutorial<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:03.510> dribble<00:00:03.990> force<00:00:04.279> okay<00:00:05.480> this

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
tutorial on the dribble force okay this

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.509 
tutorial on the dribble force okay this
is<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> really<00:00:06.960> actually<00:00:07.529> practical<00:00:08.250> force

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
is a really actually practical force

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.030 
is a really actually practical force
that<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.150> use<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:10.200> front<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.559> spectators

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
that you can use in front of spectators

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.520 
that you can use in front of spectators
most<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.090> know<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.570> riffle<00:00:13.019> force<00:00:13.259> where

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
most of you know the riffle force where

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350 
most of you know the riffle force where
you<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> break<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.820> them<00:00:15.000> call

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
you have a break and you have them call

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
you have a break and you have them call
out<00:00:15.509> stop<00:00:15.809> when<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.199> riffle<00:00:16.590> then<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.310> pick

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
out stop when you riffle then you pick

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.050 
out stop when you riffle then you pick
up<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.940> break<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.199> lot<00:00:19.590> different

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
up out the break this is a lot different

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.000 
up out the break this is a lot different
this<00:00:21.060> involves<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> dribble<00:00:22.020> which<00:00:22.590> looks<00:00:22.859> like

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
this involves a dribble which looks like

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.240 
this involves a dribble which looks like
this<00:00:24.080> I'm<00:00:25.080> assuming<00:00:25.320> most<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.980> know<00:00:26.099> how

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this I'm assuming most of you know how

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
this I'm assuming most of you know how
to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> dribble<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:27.960> there<00:00:28.140> are

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to do a dribble if you don't there are

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
to do a dribble if you don't there are
plenty<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.529> tutorials<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:29.010> YouTube<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.730> do

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
plenty of tutorials on YouTube I can do

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
plenty of tutorials on YouTube I can do
one<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.449> want<00:00:30.660> me<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.949> but<00:00:31.949> there

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
one if you really want me to but there

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650 
one if you really want me to but there
are<00:00:32.130> plenty<00:00:32.279> out<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.940> let's<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.540> get

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
are plenty out there and let's just get

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.740 
are plenty out there and let's just get
right<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
right into it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.970 
right into it
for<00:00:36.750> those<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> who<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.770> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
for those of you who like to do that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
for those of you who like to do that
diagonal<00:00:40.040> dribble<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.300> work<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.930> this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
diagonal dribble that will work for this

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.830 
diagonal dribble that will work for this
one<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.590> personally<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.300> dribble<00:00:45.660> force

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
one but personally for the dribble force

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
one but personally for the dribble force
I<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> straight<00:00:47.640> on

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I like to do more of the straight on

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
I like to do more of the straight on
dribble<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.079> saying<00:00:49.320> like

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
dribble if you know what I'm saying like

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.910 
dribble if you know what I'm saying like
not<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> diagonal<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.050> but<00:00:52.050> either<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.410> will

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
not the diagonal one but either one will

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.630 
not the diagonal one but either one will
work<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:54.120> give<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.469> practice<00:00:55.640> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
work if you give it practice so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170 
work if you give it practice so
basically<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.520> force<00:00:59.520> works<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.030> can

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
basically how this force works I can

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080 
basically how this force works I can
give<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> demonstration<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.109> want<00:01:02.090> I'm

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
give a demonstration if you want I'm

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.600 
give a demonstration if you want I'm
just<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.449> force<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.290> two<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.890> spades<00:01:05.040> on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
just going to force the two of spades on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.859 
just going to force the two of spades on
the<00:01:06.360> spectator<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:09.420> cut<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> cards<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.909> I'll

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the spectator I can cut the cards a I'll

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.719 
the spectator I can cut the cards a I'll
shuffle<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:17.270> give<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.540> final<00:01:18.750> cut<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
shuffle them and give one final cut and

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.429 
shuffle them and give one final cut and
have<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.909> call<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.150> stop<00:01:21.360> whenever<00:01:21.570> right

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
have them call it stop whenever right

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
have them call it stop whenever right
there<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> sure<00:01:23.520> okay<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> just

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
there are you sure okay and you just

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380 
there are you sure okay and you just
happen<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> call<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.130> stop<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> two<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
happen to call out stop on the two of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
happen to call out stop on the two of
spades<00:01:27.860> that's<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.159> look<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.610> what

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
spades that's what it's look that's what

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
spades that's what it's look that's what
it<00:01:29.909> looks<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.299> obviously<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.200> look

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it looks like obviously it would look

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.580 
it looks like obviously it would look
better<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.430> straight-on<00:01:32.790> standpoint<00:01:33.590> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
better from a straight-on standpoint but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
better from a straight-on standpoint but
you<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> idea<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> basically<00:01:36.390> whatever

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you get the idea so basically whatever

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
you get the idea so basically whatever
card<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> force<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.880> on

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
card you want to force you want to be on

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
card you want to force you want to be on
the<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> case<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the top so in this case I'm going to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.499 
the top so in this case I'm going to
force<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.430> five<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> diamonds

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
force the five of diamonds

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
force the five of diamonds
I'll<00:01:43.229> keep<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> face<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.399> demonstration

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I'll keep it face up for demonstration

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.780 
I'll keep it face up for demonstration
purposes<00:01:45.979> what<00:01:46.979> you're<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> you're

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
purposes what you're gonna do is you're

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.300 
purposes what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:01:47.880> swing<00:01:48.299> cut<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:50.159> than

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
gonna swing cut I like to do more than

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.539 
gonna swing cut I like to do more than
half<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:51.180> two-thirds<00:01:52.009> it'll<00:01:53.009> give<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
half about two-thirds it'll give the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.300 
half about two-thirds it'll give the
force<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.780> higher<00:01:55.290> percentage<00:01:55.770> chance<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
force a higher percentage chance of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.600 
force a higher percentage chance of
working<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.930> less<00:01:58.799> than<00:01:59.040> half<00:01:59.250> it's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
working if you do less than half it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
working if you do less than half it's
really<00:01:59.939> not<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> work<00:02:00.479> well<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.770> do

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
really not going to work well so just do

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.510 
really not going to work well so just do
more<00:02:02.130> than<00:02:02.280> half<00:02:03.530> about<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> much<00:02:04.950> probably

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
more than half about that much probably

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
more than half about that much probably
two-thirds<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.560> you're<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> get<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
two-thirds and you're going to get a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.460 
two-thirds and you're going to get a
break<00:02:08.270> when<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> cut<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
break when you cut but you want the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.460 
break when you cut but you want the
break<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.099> invisible<00:02:11.819> from<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.060> front

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
break to be invisible from the front

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930 
break to be invisible from the front
so<00:02:13.590> either<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.040> square<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:14.640> best<00:02:14.790> you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so either you square it up as best you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.180 
so either you square it up as best you
can<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:16.020> hide<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.680> front<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.070> your

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can or you hide the front with your

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.080 
can or you hide the front with your
hands<00:02:17.460> personally<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.210> both<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:20.520> basically

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
hands personally I do both but basically

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.360 
hands personally I do both but basically
you're<00:02:21.600> gonna<00:02:21.690> get<00:02:22.350> into<00:02:22.620> dribble<00:02:22.920> position

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
you're gonna get into dribble position

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.940 
you're gonna get into dribble position
while<00:02:23.700> keeping<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.210> break<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.770> looks

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
while keeping that break so it looks

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.140 
while keeping that break so it looks
like<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:28.520> you're<00:02:29.520> gonna<00:02:29.640> dribble<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
like that and you're gonna dribble the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.600 
like that and you're gonna dribble the
cards<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.720> whenever<00:02:31.350> they<00:02:31.740> call<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.160> stop

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
cards and whenever they call out stop

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.490 
cards and whenever they call out stop
you're<00:02:33.510> gonna<00:02:33.630> bring<00:02:33.870> these<00:02:34.020> packets

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you're gonna bring these packets

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.050 
you're gonna bring these packets
together<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:34.980> let's<00:02:35.130> call<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> say<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:35.820> stay

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
together so let's call it say they stay

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.930 
together so let's call it say they stay
stop<00:02:36.450> right<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.890> they<00:02:38.280> haven't<00:02:38.550> said

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
stop right there now they haven't said

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.420 
stop right there now they haven't said
stop<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> card<00:02:39.920> that's<00:02:40.920> why<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.190> bring

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
stop on the card that's why you bring

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.690 
stop on the card that's why you bring
your<00:02:41.550> hands<00:02:41.730> together<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.650> then<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.890> pick<00:02:44.520> up

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
your hands together and then you pick up

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
your hands together and then you pick up
at<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:44.970> break<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> looks<00:02:46.800> like<00:02:46.890> you're

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
at the break so it looks like you're

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220 
at the break so it looks like you're
picking<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:47.640> where<00:02:47.850> they<00:02:47.970> say<00:02:48.180> stop<00:02:48.450> but

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
picking up where they say stop but

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.640 
picking up where they say stop but
you're<00:02:49.350> actually<00:02:49.530> picking<00:02:49.980> up<00:02:50.220> at<00:02:51.120> your<00:02:51.660> break

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you're actually picking up at your break

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.400 
you're actually picking up at your break
so<00:02:53.400> again<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.420> got<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.600> break<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.020> get<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
so again you got a break you get in the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.250 
so again you got a break you get in the
dribble<00:02:55.740> position<00:02:56.360> they<00:02:57.360> say<00:02:57.570> stop<00:02:57.840> here<00:02:58.110> you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
dribble position they say stop here you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.220 
dribble position they say stop here you
bring<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> together<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.840> there's<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.080> five

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
bring it together and there's the five

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.560 
bring it together and there's the five
of<00:03:01.380> Spades

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570

obviously<00:03:04.580> forcing<00:03:05.580> works<00:03:05.910> really<00:03:06.120> well<00:03:06.330> with

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
obviously forcing works really well with

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.699 
obviously forcing works really well with
prediction<00:03:07.560> tricks<00:03:08.959> there<00:03:09.959> are<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.320> lot<00:03:10.680> of

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
prediction tricks there are a lot of

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.350 
prediction tricks there are a lot of
them<00:03:10.920> out<00:03:11.010> there

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
them out there

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.900 
them out there
I<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:13.080> explain<00:03:13.860> one<00:03:14.160> if<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.430> really<00:03:14.640> want<00:03:14.820> me

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
I can explain one if you really want me

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.390 
I can explain one if you really want me
to<00:03:15.060> or<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> couple<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.489> really<00:03:17.959> forcing<00:03:18.959> is

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
to or a couple but really forcing is

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.130 
to or a couple but really forcing is
something<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.610> can<00:03:20.850> use<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.690> tricks<00:03:21.930> to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
something that you can use in tricks to

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.370 
something that you can use in tricks to
sort<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.380> improvise<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.170> kind

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
sort of improvise so this is just a kind

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.590 
sort of improvise so this is just a kind
of<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.620> quick<00:03:25.830> tutorial<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.670> hope<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.269> have<00:03:27.450> fun

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
of a quick tutorial I hope you have fun

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.330 
of a quick tutorial I hope you have fun
with<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.870> move<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.380> actually<00:03:28.830> works<00:03:29.100> really

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
with this move it actually works really

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.479 
with this move it actually works really
well<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.060> front<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.360> people<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.190> I'll<00:03:32.190> see<00:03:32.400> you
