then we're going to come in with a big
swatter<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.789> above<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.689> knock<00:00:31.170> down<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
swatter up above to knock down the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.330 
swatter up above to knock down the
sunlight<00:00:32.129> so<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.030> too<00:00:33.239> hot<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:35.070> water

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
sunlight so it's not too hot this water

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.040 
sunlight so it's not too hot this water
is<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.000> don't<00:00:36.210> know<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.840> ever

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
on the job just because we're able to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.680 
on the job just because we're able to
move<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.250> lot<00:01:11.280> faster<00:01:11.940> than<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.210> normally<00:01:12.420> would

moving<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.390> slow<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.170> not

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
moving pretty slow and you're not

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.219 
moving pretty slow and you're not
getting<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.580> many<00:01:17.760> shots<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
getting as many shots as you can and the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
Sun bounced stuff almost makes it a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060 
Sun bounced stuff almost makes it a
little<00:01:20.729> too<00:01:20.970> easy<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.690> end<00:01:22.410> up<00:01:22.500> spoiling

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little too easy and they end up spoiling

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
little too easy and they end up spoiling
them<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.370> then<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:23.550> expect<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.180> bit

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
them and then they expect a little bit

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.580 
them and then they expect a little bit
more<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.350 

and<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:37.220> was<00:01:37.430> lucky<00:01:37.759> enough<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:38.000> have

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and this and I was lucky enough to have

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.870 
and this and I was lucky enough to have
a<00:01:38.420> small<00:01:39.079> group<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.439> assistants<00:01:40.009> in<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.460> very

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
a small group of assistants in a very

a small group of assistants in a very

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
expensive model and my whole thing is to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.609 
expensive model and my whole thing is to
optimize<00:01:43.789> my<00:01:43.820> time<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.630> my<00:01:44.750> budget<00:01:44.960> with<00:01:45.590> a

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
small crew like this other times we have

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.190 
small crew like this other times we have
jobs<00:01:48.470> where<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:49.159> only<00:01:49.789> have<00:01:50.090> one<00:01:50.360> assistant<00:01:50.960> we

jobs where I only have one assistant we

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.260 
jobs where I only have one assistant we
end<00:01:51.350> up<00:01:51.470> using<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.890> lot<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.070> c-stands<00:01:52.759> the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
end up using a lot of c-stands the

it's an editorial you're allowed one

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.059 
it's an editorial you're allowed one

bounce<00:02:03.170> equipment<00:02:03.770> make<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.280> really<00:02:04.549> easy

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
bounce equipment make it really easy

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:18.580 
bounce equipment make it really easy
it's<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.299> having<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.780> crew

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.520 

before<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.610> use<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.450> floppy<00:02:20.840> circular

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
before we use the floppy circular

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.390 
before we use the floppy circular
reflectors<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.880> lot<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.300> foam-core<00:02:24.400> shiny

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
reflectors and a lot of foam-core shiny

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.309 
reflectors and a lot of foam-core shiny
board<00:02:25.700> stuff<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.660> which<00:02:26.959> are<00:02:27.080> just

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
board stuff like that which are just

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.600 
board stuff like that which are just
basically<00:02:28.040> awkward<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:30.560> circular<00:02:31.400> ones

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
basically awkward and the circular ones

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.089 
basically awkward and the circular ones
are<00:02:31.819> not<00:02:31.970> sturdy<00:02:32.450> nothing<00:02:33.170> holds<00:02:33.500> up<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.920> mean

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
are not sturdy nothing holds up I mean

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.699 
are not sturdy nothing holds up I mean
this<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.910> probably

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
this is probably

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.330 
this is probably
it's<00:02:37.129> like<00:02:37.370> sliced<00:02:37.640> bread<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:39.129> it's<00:02:40.129> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
it's like sliced bread it's it's the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.929 
it's like sliced bread it's it's the
best<00:02:40.549> thing<00:02:40.760> around<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.450> can't<00:02:41.870> deny<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.230> I

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
best thing around I can't deny it I

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.270 
best thing around I can't deny it I
could<00:02:43.939> be<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.360> backwards<00:02:44.720> if<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.349> went<00:02:46.040> about

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
could be going backwards if I went about

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.559 
could be going backwards if I went about
it<00:02:46.430> any<00:02:46.579> other<00:02:46.640> way<00:02:46.819> these<00:02:47.150> days

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.130 

the<00:02:54.409> light<00:02:54.620> quality<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.610> old<00:02:56.140> circular

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the light quality of the old circular

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.199 
the light quality of the old circular
desk<00:02:57.379> reflectors<00:02:58.069> was<00:02:58.549> really<00:02:58.909> inconsistent
