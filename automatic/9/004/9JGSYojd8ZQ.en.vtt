 screen you can just find a video 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.670

 update no place and above all 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.770
 no video 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 in that case also if you want to own 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 be sure you don't miss anything there 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 remember to download my application 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.699
 completely free for browsers 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 obviously find the link of 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.090
 the latter in the description but we are 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 so finally to the real ones 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.079
 information about the game between the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.000
 last notes that have been communicated 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.489
 we have that concerning the map of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 in fact, Paris is much more 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.580
 vast compared to that of writing 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.320
 four black flags 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 I don't know if you remember that of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 black flag was really vast for 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.619
 which included a lot of sea 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 especially because there were islands 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.930
 writings are scattered and good guys 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 united will be even more vast therefore they are 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.780
 curious to see how it will be 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.610
 possible to move from one point 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.650
 to the other because they think it is 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.119
 of a very large map 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.040
 there should be some way 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.320
 especially ingenious detail for 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.570
 move from one point to another anyway 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.130
 I hope to find out soon as we have 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 already said in the past will be possible 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.759
 enter inside some monuments 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 present in the city among other things some of 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.180
 they will also be shown in scale 1 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.939
 to 1 with what we don't know why 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.560
 many buildings many simple buildings 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.540
 present in the city even though they will be 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.939
 also explorable there is information 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 about the fact that the neighborhoods between 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.020
 they will be very different indeed not 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.240
 I know if maybe you noticed in the previous ones 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.520
 assassin's creed maybe among the different ones 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 city ​​some neighborhoods looked alike 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.479
 to be honest while this one instead 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.829
 time there will be some features 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.940
 details that will succeed in 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.229
 to distinguish 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.060
 go and get some points 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.860
 reference to recognize precisely the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 point of the city where we are 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.100
 lately I've noticed that many of you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.440
 in the comments they are asking me how 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.240
 myers write it together will come out only 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.370
 for next gen and pc 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 in fact the developers from the point have 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.940
 received these same questions I believe 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 a lot more than mine 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.110
 in fact they gave another one bed 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.000
 statement explained the fact 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.400
 that precisely create a game of the kind 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.980
 so dough so the complex requires 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.420
 precisely the much more powerful hardware e 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.380
 therefore the game is intended solely 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.490
 for design and pc because precisely 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.920
 allow the creation of a title 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.330
 much more complex also despite 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.200
 that is guys we have a little one 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.550
 particularity or wolf in this regard a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.440
 spoleto obviously in trunk stopped 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.240
 in fact one of the representatives of ubisoft 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.040
 announced that they are aware that 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.840
 there are so many fans around the world 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.520
 assassin's creed and therefore would like 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.260
 give all the information for soon 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.660
 those who are his kind therefore 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.250
 guys maybe I repeat maybe they could 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.230
 there will soon be news for those 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.270
 precisely that they don't have the next gen and then 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.700
 however playing for a new title of 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.350
 assassin's creed on 360 and playstation 3 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.180
 information that in this period has 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.680
 brought some criticism of ubisoft is 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.380
 that concerning the fact that it will not be 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.200
 You can play through a character 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.620
 female in the multiplayer mode of the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.180
 game 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.650
 according to the developers this is 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.330
 determined by the fact that creating a 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.030
 female character would have requested 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.600
 much more work precisely in development 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.489
 of the game 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.650
 this led to many calls 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.239
 criticism concerns the fact that in the end 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.610
 there wouldn't be that much 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.320
 work but at any rate ubisoft itself has 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.480
 declared that he does not want to give 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.850
 impositions to developers but not 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.580
 such as to leave them free in fact 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.080
 develop your own games also one 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.150
 real explanation was given 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.830
 from ubisoft about this situation 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.750
 or the fact that anyone will play 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.330
 just 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.650
 multiplayer will always play 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.600
 so this means that if ad 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.730
 example you are in 4 friends you are playing 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.050
 multiplayer each of you will see the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.580
 own character that is playing 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.110
 how arno so you can 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.760
 customize it as you like 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.280
 to distinguish it from others but to 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.260
 end the face the features will be 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.299
 precisely those of arno itself are there 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.640
 two other information the first concerns 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.590
 the multiplayer indeed in the latter 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.470
 we can still play with ours 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.420
 friends explore the whole of paris but not 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.010
 in fact it will always be possible to do so 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.169
 they are however phases of the game in which 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.880
 we will have to play alone then and practice 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.830
 we will have to carry out simple missions 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.630
 in single player mode only after 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.220
 then we will still have to do some of 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.800
 I believe these missions will be 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.180
 however secondary missions from note 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.890
 play with our friends for 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.360
 have fun inside the city 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.160
 so guys in this video yes 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.390
 he concludes here as soon as there are new ones 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.860
 information obviously that the 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.930
 I will communicate as soon as I have the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.580
 possibility so guys I remind you of

 Hello
