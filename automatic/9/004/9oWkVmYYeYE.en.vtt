00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
sealed package it's pretty much similar

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
sealed package it's pretty much similar
to<00:00:47.750> MRE<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.899> suppose<00:00:49.469> only<00:00:49.770> make<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> yourself<00:00:51.180> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to MRE I suppose only make it yourself I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
to MRE I suppose only make it yourself I
just<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> show<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.100> weighs

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
just want to show you what this weighs

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.029 
just want to show you what this weighs
in<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.989> 3,500<00:00:55.860> calories

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
in at this is about 3,500 calories

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670 
in at this is about 3,500 calories
because<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.730> did<00:00:56.879> add<00:00:57.059> some<00:00:57.559> sunflower<00:00:58.559> seeds

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because I did add some sunflower seeds

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
because I did add some sunflower seeds
and<00:00:59.840> some<00:01:00.840> beef<00:01:00.989> jerky<00:01:02.270> which<00:01:03.270> were<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.719> extra

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and some beef jerky which were an extra

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.490 
and some beef jerky which were an extra
450<00:01:04.949> calories<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.260> that's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
450 calories so as you can see that's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.660 
450 calories so as you can see that's
930<00:01:08.310> grams<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.150> approximately<00:01:10.670> maybe

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
930 grams so that's approximately maybe

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
930 grams so that's approximately maybe
2.1<00:01:12.600> pounds<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.439> total<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.520> 15

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
2.1 pounds so the total here is about 15

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.320 
2.1 pounds so the total here is about 15
pounds<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.600> seven<00:01:19.590> days<00:01:19.710> worth<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> food<00:01:20.330> if

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
pounds for seven days worth of food if

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
pounds for seven days worth of food if
you<00:01:21.450> ask<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.080> pretty<00:01:22.320> good<00:01:22.500> especially

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you ask me that's pretty good especially

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.530 
you ask me that's pretty good especially
considering<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> 3,500<00:01:26.040> calories<00:01:26.540> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
considering as this is 3,500 calories of

considering as this is 3,500 calories of
all<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.070> micro<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.250> macro<00:01:29.610> nutrients<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.270> need

all the micro and macro nutrients I need

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
all the micro and macro nutrients I need
approximately<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> hundred<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.820> sixty<00:01:33.390> grams

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
approximately a hundred and sixty grams

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
of protein in each package and I'm not

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700 
of protein in each package and I'm not
entirely<00:01:38.430> sure<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.590> denomination<00:01:40.590> of

too<00:01:45.750> concerned<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
too concerned with that I do have a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.789 
too concerned with that I do have a
fairly<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.610> split<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.619> there's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
fairly good split you know that there's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.510 
fairly good split you know that there's
3500<00:01:50.549> calories<00:01:50.909> total<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> lot<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
3500 calories total now a lot of that is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480 
3500 calories total now a lot of that is
coming<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.090> fats<00:01:54.570> obviously<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
coming from fats obviously because the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.420 
coming from fats obviously because the
only<00:01:56.640> way<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> store<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.530> amount<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.979> food<00:01:59.159> in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
only way to store that amount of food in

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.749 
only way to store that amount of food in
such<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> small<00:01:59.969> space<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.680> such<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.950> small<00:02:02.399> mass

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
such a small space in such a small mass

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
such a small space in such a small mass
is<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:04.350> add<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> fats<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.600> fats<00:02:06.869> or

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
is to add a lot of fats as fats or

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.440 
is to add a lot of fats as fats or
double<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> calories<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.670> carbohydrates

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.750 

so<00:02:12.349> I<00:02:12.380> do<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.290> said<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
so I do have like I said you know the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.280 
so I do have like I said you know the
reason<00:02:17.060> why<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.209> wanted<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.720> take<00:02:18.080> this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
reason why I wanted to take this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.900 
reason why I wanted to take this
approach<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:19.130> because<00:02:19.370> they<00:02:19.550> don't<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:19.730> to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
approach is because they don't have to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.150 
approach is because they don't have to
cook<00:02:20.090> having<00:02:20.390> anything<00:02:20.780> if<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.739> don't<00:02:21.920> want<00:02:22.069> to

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
cook having anything if I don't want to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.080 
cook having anything if I don't want to
I<00:02:22.280> may<00:02:22.640> actually<00:02:22.940> bring<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.830> few<00:02:25.489> odds<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.849> ends

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
I may actually bring a few odds and ends

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.600 
I may actually bring a few odds and ends
to<00:02:26.930> cook<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.830> imagine<00:02:27.980> halfway

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
to cook because I imagine halfway

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.130 
to cook because I imagine halfway
through<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> journey<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:29.660> gonna<00:02:29.870> want

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
through the journey I'm gonna want

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.540 
through the journey I'm gonna want
something<00:02:30.680> cooked<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:34.160> know<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.400> not

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
something cooked but you know I'm not

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.220 
something cooked but you know I'm not
too<00:02:34.819> concerned<00:02:35.090> with<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.600> I'd<00:02:35.780> rather<00:02:35.959> have

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
too concerned with that I'd rather have

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.170 
too concerned with that I'd rather have
convenience<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> most<00:02:37.489> part<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.970> just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
convenience for the most part and just

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.800 
convenience for the most part and just
enjoy<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.019> scenery<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.660> people

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
enjoy the scenery and the and the people

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.259 
enjoy the scenery and the and the people
and<00:02:42.170> stuff<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:42.560> that

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
and stuff like that

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.380 
and stuff like that
so<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.069> what<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> outcome<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.060> far

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
so this is what the outcome is so far

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.930 
so this is what the outcome is so far
and<00:02:47.690> I'm<00:02:48.440> gonna<00:02:48.560> pack<00:02:48.830> all<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.160> up<00:02:49.220> into<00:02:49.670> a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.870 

probably<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.830> compression<00:02:54.830> sack<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.610> some

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
probably like a compression sack of some

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.090 
probably like a compression sack of some
sort<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.530> great<00:02:57.709> thing<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.069> about

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
sort and the great thing I like about

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.780 
sort and the great thing I like about
this<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.790> for<00:02:59.739> one<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.040> mean<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.519> kind<00:03:01.760> of

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
this is that for one I mean it kind of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.840 
this is that for one I mean it kind of
blocks<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.269> scent<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.720> food<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.730> know

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
blocks the scent to the food so you know

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.620 
blocks the scent to the food so you know
wildlife<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.630> gonna<00:03:05.780> be<00:03:05.900> less<00:03:06.080> likely<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:07.630> try

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
wildlife is gonna be less likely to try

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.680 
wildlife is gonna be less likely to try
to<00:03:08.690> dispel<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.069> potentially<00:03:10.880> eat<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.180> and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
to dispel it and potentially eat it and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.890 
to dispel it and potentially eat it and
come<00:03:11.870> at<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:13.180> also<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.299> gonna<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.600> very<00:03:14.810> easy

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
come at you also it's gonna be very easy

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.430 
come at you also it's gonna be very easy
to<00:03:15.650> manage<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.970> keep<00:03:17.390> organized<00:03:17.989> because

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
to manage and keep organized because

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.930 
to manage and keep organized because
every<00:03:18.769> day<00:03:18.920> I'll<00:03:19.100> just<00:03:19.130> crack<00:03:19.549> one<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> these

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
every day I'll just crack one of these

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.210 
every day I'll just crack one of these
packs<00:03:20.269> everything<00:03:21.170> within<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.680> package<00:03:22.070> is

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
packs everything within the package is

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.660 
packs everything within the package is
individually<00:03:23.320> wrapped<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.560> packaged<00:03:25.100> also

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
individually wrapped and packaged also

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.330 
individually wrapped and packaged also
so<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.810> can<00:03:27.320> sort<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.620> eat<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.920> throughout<00:03:28.190> the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
so I can sort of eat it throughout the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.240 
so I can sort of eat it throughout the
course<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.820> day<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:30.769> going<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.040> pack

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
course of the day and it's going to pack

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.890 
course of the day and it's going to pack
down<00:03:31.570> rather<00:03:32.570> easily<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:34.130> do<00:03:34.519> have<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.880> I'm<00:03:35.690> gonna

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
down rather easily I do have a I'm gonna

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.970 
down rather easily I do have a I'm gonna
show<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.500> bug<00:03:37.489> out<00:03:37.750> bag<00:03:38.750> if<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.739> want<00:03:39.920> to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
show you the bug out bag if you want to

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.349 
show you the bug out bag if you want to
call<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.030> more<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.299> an

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
call it that really is more of an

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.539 
call it that really is more of an
expedition<00:03:41.690> bag<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.650> have<00:03:45.769> an<00:03:45.890> 85<00:03:46.280> liter

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
expedition bag and I do have an 85 liter

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.780 
expedition bag and I do have an 85 liter
pack<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.780> space<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.380> not<00:03:48.650> too<00:03:49.430> big<00:03:49.609> of<00:03:49.730> a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
pack so the space is not too big of a

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.880 
pack so the space is not too big of a
deal<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.160> bit<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.609> space<00:03:52.850> but<00:03:53.890> you

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
deal so it is a bit of space but you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.590 
deal so it is a bit of space but you
know<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.579> is<00:03:55.609> seven<00:03:56.209> days<00:03:56.359> worth

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
know for what it is seven days worth

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.559 
know for what it is seven days worth
food<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.290> it's<00:03:57.440> going<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:57.950> be<00:03:58.329> everyday<00:03:59.329> it's

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
food and it's going to be everyday it's

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.289 
food and it's going to be everyday it's
gonna<00:03:59.690> be<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> little<00:04:00.109> bit<00:04:00.319> later<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:02.030> it's

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
gonna be a little bit later so it's

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.380 
gonna be a little bit later so it's
really<00:04:02.450> not<00:04:02.630> too<00:04:02.930> bad<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:04.430> think<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:05.120> should<00:04:05.329> be

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
really not too bad I think it should be

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.229 
really not too bad I think it should be
okay<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:06.310> I'm<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.519> going<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:07.970> find

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
okay and I'm just going to have to find

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.300 
okay and I'm just going to have to find
the<00:04:08.329> right<00:04:08.600> sort<00:04:08.930> of<00:04:09.019> stuff<00:04:09.380> sack<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.920> put<00:04:10.130> this

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the right sort of stuff sack to put this

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.470 
the right sort of stuff sack to put this
in<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.799> let<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.100> know<00:04:13.250> I'll<00:04:14.209> probably

do part three of this series which will
be<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.329> bug<00:04:17.959> out<00:04:18.109> bag<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.709> gear<00:04:18.950> within

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
be the bug out bag and the gear within

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.210 
be the bug out bag and the gear within
that<00:04:19.489> itself<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:21.049> should<00:04:21.080> be<00:04:21.470> out<00:04:21.650> tomorrow
