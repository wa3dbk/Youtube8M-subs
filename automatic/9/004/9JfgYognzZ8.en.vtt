of<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> really<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.900> until<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.560> day<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
of this is really going until one day a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.120 
of this is really going until one day a
girl<00:01:38.159> happens<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> fall<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.909> top<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> him<00:01:39.479> and

girl happens to fall on top of him and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
girl happens to fall on top of him and
that's<00:01:41.130> basically<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> info<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> got<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.079> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that's basically all the info I got so I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.389 
that's basically all the info I got so I
don't<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.590> what's<00:01:43.799> where<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
don't know what's where it's going to go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.910 
don't know what's where it's going to go
from<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.729> maybe<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.930> girl<00:01:46.229> might<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> cat

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
from here maybe the girl might be a cat

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.399 
from here maybe the girl might be a cat
on<00:01:46.950> I'm<00:01:47.610> assuming<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.930> don't<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.200> who

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
on I'm assuming so I don't know who

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.520 
on I'm assuming so I don't know who
knows<00:01:49.610> last<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.000> certainly<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.509> least<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:52.200> an

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
knows last but certainly not least is an

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
now I believe I have seen a little bit

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
now I believe I have seen a little bit
of<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.810> anime<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.800> was<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.070> ona

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
of this anime I think it was an ona

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.490 
of this anime I think it was an ona
series<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.450> was<00:02:27.570> really<00:02:27.840> short<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.320> like

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
series that was really short it was like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.440 
series that was really short it was like
maybe<00:02:28.680> two<00:02:28.950> or<00:02:28.980> three<00:02:29.190> minutes<00:02:29.670> long<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
maybe two or three minutes long and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.330 
maybe two or three minutes long and
episode<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.650> was<00:02:31.770> all<00:02:31.920> right<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.310> was

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
episode and it was all right it was

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
episode and it was all right it was
funny<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.270> know<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.630> had<00:02:33.990> hardly<00:02:34.290> any

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
funny but you know I just had hardly any

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.260 
funny but you know I just had hardly any
depth<00:02:34.770> at<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.250> random<00:02:35.550> gags<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
depth at all it was just random gags and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.100 
depth at all it was just random gags and
I<00:02:36.300> didn't<00:02:36.480> really<00:02:36.570> know<00:02:36.750> who<00:02:36.840> any<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
I didn't really know who any of the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.630 
I didn't really know who any of the
characters<00:02:37.290> were<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.190> now<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.520> they're

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
characters were so now that they're

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.010 
characters were so now that they're
going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.940> making<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.270> series<00:02:39.600> out<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I makes me kind of curious as to where

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.820 
I makes me kind of curious as to where
they<00:02:42.240> will<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.510> taking<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.960> so<00:02:43.140> anyway

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.680 
picks for the winter 2011 anime and
that's<00:02:52.680> basically<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.760> know<00:02:54.000> they<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.510> came

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690

out<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> little<00:02:55.080> bit<00:02:55.320> more<00:02:56.070> quirky<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.640> might

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
out a little bit more quirky you might

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.449 
out a little bit more quirky you might
say<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.720> was<00:02:57.810> kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.620> know<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.100> stories

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
say it was kind of you know the stories

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.800 
say it was kind of you know the stories
were<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.640> little<00:02:59.760> bit<00:02:59.940> odd<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.450> fact<00:03:00.630> one<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
were a little bit odd in fact one of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
were a little bit odd in fact one of
them<00:03:00.959> technically<00:03:01.290> didn't<00:03:01.530> even<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
them technically didn't even have a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.340 
them technically didn't even have a
story<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:03.060> I'm<00:03:03.390> still<00:03:03.630> hoping<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.230> know

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
story but I'm still hoping that you know

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.260 
story but I'm still hoping that you know
they'll<00:03:04.500> turn<00:03:04.680> out<00:03:04.709> all<00:03:05.010> right<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> anyway

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
they'll turn out all right so anyway

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.790 
they'll turn out all right so anyway
since<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.750> can't<00:03:07.020> really<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.650> witty

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
since I can't really think of a witty

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.470 
since I can't really think of a witty
kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.340> joke<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.670> end<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:08.940> video<00:03:09.240> on<00:03:09.450> that

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
kind of joke to end this video on that

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.880 
kind of joke to end this video on that
probably<00:03:09.990> would<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.230> been<00:03:10.350> funny<00:03:10.560> anyway

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
probably would have been funny anyway

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.310 
probably would have been funny anyway
I'll<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.670> ended<00:03:12.000> by<00:03:12.120> saying<00:03:12.360> as<00:03:12.660> see<00:03:13.230> you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
I'll just ended by saying as see you
