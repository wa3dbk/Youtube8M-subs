spots<00:00:41.660> they<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.930> immediately<00:00:43.110> went<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
spots they just immediately went to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.450 
spots they just immediately went to
filing<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> did<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.739> realize<00:00:47.129> was

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

that<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.180> cut<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.960> whole<00:00:48.989> top

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
completely off and so instead of it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.689 
completely off and so instead of it
being<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.460> they

that<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.510> broke<00:02:47.870> my<00:02:48.110> denture<00:02:48.440> by<00:02:49.010> cutting<00:02:49.400> it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
that they broke my denture by cutting it

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.420 
that they broke my denture by cutting it
down<00:02:49.550> too<00:02:49.880> low<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.860> we're<00:02:51.860> gonna<00:02:51.950> find<00:02:52.250> out

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
down too low so we're gonna find out

you<00:03:55.959> know<00:03:56.109> you're<00:03:56.650> just<00:03:56.680> praying<00:03:57.129> that<00:03:57.250> you're

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
you know you're just praying that you're

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.240

biting<00:03:57.819> hard<00:03:58.000> enough<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.500> don't<00:03:59.560> know<00:03:59.920> what

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
biting hard enough and I don't know what

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.920

possessed<00:04:00.459> me<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.849> walk<00:04:01.120> out<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.540> office

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
possessed me to walk out of that office

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.080 
possessed me to walk out of that office
without<00:04:02.140> smiling<00:04:02.829> in<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:02.980> mirror<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:04.060> I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
without smiling in the mirror but I

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.490 
without smiling in the mirror but I
think<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.599> was<00:04:04.689> because<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.989> just<00:04:05.019> could<00:04:05.379> not

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
think it was because I just could not

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.640 
think it was because I just could not
get<00:04:05.709> out<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:06.010> there<00:04:06.129> fast<00:04:06.310> enough<00:04:07.139> but<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.379> was

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
get out of there fast enough but I was

get out of there fast enough but I was
on<00:04:08.799> my<00:04:08.980> way<00:04:09.159> home<00:04:09.400> when<00:04:10.299> I<00:04:10.329> saw<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:11.439> when<00:04:11.620> I

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
on my way home when I saw that when I

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.699 
on my way home when I saw that when I
smiled<00:04:12.189> my<00:04:12.939> lip<00:04:13.180> actually<00:04:13.719> rests<00:04:14.139> on<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.530> top

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709
