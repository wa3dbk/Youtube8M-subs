this<00:02:59.450> time<00:02:59.720> it's<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> high-pass<00:03:00.379> filter<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.690> as

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
this time it's a high-pass filter and as

this time it's a high-pass filter and as
you<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.080> guess<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.769> used<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.160> lower<00:03:04.370> the
