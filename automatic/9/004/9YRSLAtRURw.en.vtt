00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.849
 hello friends of the last one we are here 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.609
 a new video tutorial this time I'm going 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.169
 to say how to connect a microphone 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.750
 wireless and also a microphone 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:37.140
 wired to your computer 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 Well, let's just do it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 this the only thing we will need is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 our microphone in the case of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 wired a cable 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.520
 obviously it's 6.5 minutes the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 cables that greg is in which are the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 those are not going to serve you in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.240
 this time to connect to your 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.320
 computer 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.140
 because there is not an adapter that you 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.430
 allows to connect it from this type of 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 cables to your computer 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.790
 the author that tablets this room very 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 small in which you connect it the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.560
 plus 6.5 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.390
 he adapts it to a 3.5 millimeter one and goes 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.170
 with him everything direct to your computer to your 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.170
 mic input 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.250
 there are cables or if not existing ones 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.950
 they are manufactured under request obviously in 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.340
 musical fats 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.659
 direct or not with this plus but with 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.960
 a direct plus of 3.5 mm 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.060
 this would be the the forms 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.060
 overheated wired microphones 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.900
 how to connect to your wireless microphone 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.680
 for this there are two types of 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.650
 wireless microphones the first 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.799
 is this type of microphone that is a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.299
 microphone for each eye that usually 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:25.180
 these microphones are basic are between 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:28.269
 15 and 20 dollars 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.300
 there you can see very well these 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:36.590
 microphones are battery operated 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 and then so you can see it 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.780
 are the rows the microphone and also 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.780
 the receptor 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.380
 how we connect the receiver to our 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 computer 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.900
 the truth is very easy like the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.940
 previous way with the club this is the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.980
 only way you can connect this 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.590
 type of microphones obviously for whom 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.590
 you can not get rid of him 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.970
 of the issuer pardon the sender of the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.370
 wailers 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.380
 this would be the only way to connect 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.380
 these wireless microphones 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.120
 there are other kinds of microphones 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.099
 wireless 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.670
 that of these that are a little bit more 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.870
 professionals that come with your source 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.870
 of power its emitter 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.540
 come with this cable that is twice as 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:46.330
 6.5 mm and in the back 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.670
 can see how they have 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.000
 when doing how to remove the camera has a 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.840
 input sorry a microphone output 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.840
 in which the cable is connected 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.880
 and the other of course goes to a console 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.040
 an interface but at home we 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.540
 we want to connect the computer as 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.200
 we do two ways the one is obviously 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.910
 with the adapter the second one and the one that I 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.760
 I recommend you make your cable 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.920
 even if you buy a cable in my case I 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.030
 I did it I made it buy the plus 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.030
 the plus of 6.5 millimeters and the club 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.030
 3.5 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.689
 those of altable 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.580
 and more or less it came out for about 34 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.160
 Dollars 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.280
 It is connected to one 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.180
 the entrance 6.5 obviously to the exit 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.660
 of the microphone 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.800
 and the other one to your entrance in exchange for 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.800
 computer microphone 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.250
 these microphones unlike the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.430
 previous work the battery does not 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.340
 they work in rows like I already told you 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.470
 the previous ones 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.630
 and here they are because we had professionals 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.630
 Your brand of hf 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.900
 and I think this would be all for the video 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.090
