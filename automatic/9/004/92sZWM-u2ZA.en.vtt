that on this block and so I think that's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
that on this block and so I think that's
a<00:00:49.920> red<00:00:50.130> flag<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> police<00:00:51.150> should

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
a red flag and I think the police should

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
a red flag and I think the police should
focus<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.840> those<00:00:52.050> people

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
why won't they want that on their block
