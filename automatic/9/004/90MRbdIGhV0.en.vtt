overs as well

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.979 
overs as well
what<00:02:13.959> other<00:02:14.140> bets<00:02:14.349> are<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.620> looking<00:02:14.920> at<00:02:15.989> as

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
what other bets are you looking at as

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.229 
what other bets are you looking at as
straightforward<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.069> emitting<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
straightforward and emitting just so the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.849 
straightforward and emitting just so the
reasons<00:02:19.659> there<00:02:19.780> at<00:02:19.870> two<00:02:20.019> point<00:02:20.260> oh<00:02:20.319> five<00:02:20.560> it's

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
reasons there at two point oh five it's

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.240 
reasons there at two point oh five it's
it's<00:02:21.340> great<00:02:21.640> odds<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.939> think<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.629> still<00:02:23.079> got<00:02:23.200> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it's great odds I think I still got a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.740 
it's great odds I think I still got a
mid-table<00:02:24.250> bottom<00:02:24.640> half<00:02:24.819> team<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.510> tighten

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
mid-table bottom half team and tighten

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.360 
mid-table bottom half team and tighten
them<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.870> fighting<00:02:26.109> for<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.439> top-four<00:02:26.709> spot<00:02:26.920> so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
them up fighting for a top-four spot so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.589 
them up fighting for a top-four spot so
there's<00:02:27.549> there's<00:02:27.790> no<00:02:27.939> reason<00:02:28.120> why<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.390> Tom

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
there's there's no reason why just Tom

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.849 
there's there's no reason why just Tom
and<00:02:28.750> shouldn't<00:02:29.019> win<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.379> the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
and shouldn't win this and the

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.259 
and shouldn't win this and the
bookmakers<00:02:30.310> been<00:02:30.459> quite<00:02:30.640> generous<00:02:30.970> i<00:02:31.060> think

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
bookmakers been quite generous i think

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.539 
bookmakers been quite generous i think
it<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.840> i<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.319> that<00:02:32.439> a<00:02:32.500> Tottenham<00:02:33.010> win<00:02:33.189> two

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
it is i like that a Tottenham win two

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.160 
it is i like that a Tottenham win two
point<00:02:33.790> oh<00:02:33.909> five<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.569> I<00:02:34.780> think<00:02:34.840> they're<00:02:35.079> going

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
point oh five and I think they're going

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.539 
point oh five and I think they're going
to<00:02:35.230> come<00:02:35.379> back<00:02:35.530> into<00:02:35.739> this<00:02:35.890> match<00:02:35.950> fighting
