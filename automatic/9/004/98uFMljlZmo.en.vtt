00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.530 

hello<00:00:01.890> everyone<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.550> welcome<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.939> my

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hello everyone and welcome to my

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.519 
hello everyone and welcome to my
demonstration<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.790> noisy<00:00:05.790> cricket<00:00:05.970> and

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
demonstration of the noisy cricket and

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:14.209 
demonstration of the noisy cricket and
this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.360> base<00:00:09.360> modded<00:00:10.290> version<00:00:11.090> so<00:00:13.219> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this is the base modded version so the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.430 
this is the base modded version so the
only<00:00:14.429> difference<00:00:14.759> between<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
only difference between this and the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
only difference between this and the
version<00:00:16.650> which<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.310> will<00:00:17.550> link<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
version which I will link in the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.490 
version which I will link in the
description<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:19.070> that<00:00:20.359> there's<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.480> 47<00:00:22.289> nano

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
description is that there's a 47 nano

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
description is that there's a 47 nano
farad<00:00:22.740> capacitor<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.640> there<00:00:23.789> that's<00:00:24.060> switched

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
farad capacitor in there that's switched

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.339 
farad capacitor in there that's switched
to<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:27.680> 1uf<00:00:28.680> capacitor<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.869> makes<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
to a 1uf capacitor and that makes it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.950 
to a 1uf capacitor and that makes it
into<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> base<00:00:32.040> version<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.510> noisy<00:00:33.840> cricket

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
into a base version of the noisy cricket

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.030 
into a base version of the noisy cricket
amplifier<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:37.550> with<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.450> said<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.920> be

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
amplifier so with that said I will be

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.630 
amplifier so with that said I will be
using<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:42.920> Squire<00:00:43.920> Jay<00:00:44.370> bass<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:45.629> demonstrate

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
using my Squire Jay bass to demonstrate

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
using my Squire Jay bass to demonstrate
not<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.059> bass<00:00:48.270> player<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.710> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not a very good bass player but you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.930 
not a very good bass player but you
should<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.980> able<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.430> some<00:00:50.579> idea<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
should be able to get at some idea of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.720 
should be able to get at some idea of
the<00:00:51.090> sounds<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> power

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the sounds so we have here the power

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.950 
the sounds so we have here the power
switch<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> LED<00:00:55.320> indicator<00:00:56.600> first<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
switch with the LED indicator first is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
switch with the LED indicator first is
volume<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.530> need<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.829> some<00:00:59.010> knobs<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
volume I need to get some knobs for it I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.200 
volume I need to get some knobs for it I
know<00:01:00.140> first<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.350> volume<00:01:01.789> that's<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> tone

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
know first is volume that's the tone

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
know first is volume that's the tone
control<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> grit<00:01:04.949> switch<00:01:05.250> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
control and this is the grit switch so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.030 
control and this is the grit switch so
you<00:01:06.180> flick<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> acts<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.619> sort<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you flick it up and it acts as sort of a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
you flick it up and it acts as sort of a
booster<00:01:08.630> as<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.140> dial<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.610> gain<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.540> get

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
booster as you dial the gain you get

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.649 
booster as you dial the gain you get
more<00:01:13.470> volume<00:01:15.979> I'm<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.250> sure<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
more volume I'm not sure if it's a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.120 
more volume I'm not sure if it's a
distortion<00:01:20.000> control<00:01:21.000> per<00:01:21.390> se<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:22.530> may<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.860> on

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
distortion control per se it may be on

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
distortion control per se it may be on
the<00:01:23.250> guitar<00:01:23.520> version<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:25.080> find<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the guitar version but I just find that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.480 
the guitar version but I just find that
with<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.659> bass<00:01:27.659> version<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.829> built<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
with the bass version that I built it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
with the bass version that I built it
just<00:01:29.759> sort<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> adds<00:01:30.240> extra<00:01:30.930> volume<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> just

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
just sort of adds extra volume so I just

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
just sort of adds extra volume so I just
consider<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> boost<00:01:33.000> than<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
consider it more of a boost than a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
consider it more of a boost than a
distortion<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:37.250> start<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.369> everything

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
distortion so start with everything

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.889 
distortion so start with everything
rolled<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.810> let's<00:01:42.810> see

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
rolled all the way back and let's see

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.710 
rolled all the way back and let's see
how<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> sounds<00:01:43.140> oh<00:01:44.180> I'm<00:01:45.180> running<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.689> through

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
how it sounds oh I'm running it through

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.830 
how it sounds oh I'm running it through
one<00:01:46.259> speaker<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:48.030> Zakk<00:01:48.329> Wylde<00:01:48.540> mini

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
one speaker out of my Zakk Wylde mini

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.539 
one speaker out of my Zakk Wylde mini
stack<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> 10-inch

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
stack so it's just like a 10-inch

00:01:50.549 --> 00:02:18.330 
stack so it's just like a 10-inch
speaker<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> think

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.800 

so<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.610> seems<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.000> handle<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.360> pretty<00:02:20.570> well<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
so it seems to handle it pretty well and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.120 
so it seems to handle it pretty well and
that's<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.050> course<00:02:24.260> with<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> tone<00:02:24.830> rolled

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
that's of course with the tone rolled

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950 
that's of course with the tone rolled
all<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.340> way<00:02:25.460> back<00:02:25.850> which<00:02:26.210> would<00:02:26.510> make<00:02:26.780> it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
all the way back which would make it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.780 
all the way back which would make it
more<00:02:27.970> dark<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.160> all<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> controls

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
more dark I just have all the controls

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.810 
more dark I just have all the controls
on<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.030> Jay<00:02:32.500> bass<00:02:33.500> cranked<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:36.250> let's<00:02:37.250> roll

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
on the Jay bass cranked so let's roll

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.090 
on the Jay bass cranked so let's roll
the<00:02:38.030> tone<00:02:38.270> until<00:02:40.930> say<00:02:41.930> some<00:02:42.650> around<00:02:42.830> there's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
the tone until say some around there's

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.830 
the tone until say some around there's
probably<00:02:43.459> half<00:02:43.670> way<00:02:43.700> never<00:02:44.420> see<00:02:44.630> how<00:02:44.690> that

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
probably half way never see how that

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:55.920 
probably half way never see how that
sounds

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.470 

so<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.769> see<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.400> tone<00:02:58.970> control<00:02:59.300> works

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
so you can see the tone control works

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.400 
so you can see the tone control works
pretty<00:02:59.660> well<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:01.220> let's<00:03:01.640> oh<00:03:02.239> no<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.050> guess<00:03:03.260> that

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
pretty well and let's oh no I guess that

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.080 
pretty well and let's oh no I guess that
was<00:03:03.560> closer<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.220> treble<00:03:04.550> side<00:03:04.700> than<00:03:05.000> I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
was closer to the treble side than I

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:22.750 
was closer to the treble side than I
thought<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.860> what<00:03:06.860> what<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.190> hell<00:03:21.760> still

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
thought so what what the hell still

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.740 
thought so what what the hell still
pretty<00:03:23.360> good

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
pretty good

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.910 
pretty good
so<00:03:25.660> install<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.870> back<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:27.410> don't<00:03:27.560> know<00:03:27.680> maybe

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
so install that back I don't know maybe

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.650 
so install that back I don't know maybe
that's<00:03:28.130> about<00:03:28.400> half<00:03:28.640> way<00:03:28.819> leave<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.569> about

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
that's about half way leave it about

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.750 
that's about half way leave it about
there<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.610> flip<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:32.000> grid<00:03:32.390> switch<00:03:32.599> on<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
there and flip the grid switch on and

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:49.070 
there and flip the grid switch on and
demonstrate<00:03:34.760> that

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.360 

so<00:03:50.080> I'm<00:03:50.560> just<00:03:50.710> going<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.920> turn<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.250> volume

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
so I'm just going to turn the volume

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640 
so I'm just going to turn the volume
down<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:52.120> bit<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.660> I'm<00:03:53.230> gonna<00:03:53.410> start

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
down a little bit and I'm gonna start

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.330 
down a little bit and I'm gonna start
breaking<00:03:54.130> this<00:03:54.280> game

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.190 

so<00:04:00.970> that's<00:04:01.180> maxed<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.390> does<00:04:07.569> distort<00:04:08.050> it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
so that's maxed so it does distort it

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:25.080 
so that's maxed so it does distort it
just<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.470> little<00:04:08.709> bit

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.749
