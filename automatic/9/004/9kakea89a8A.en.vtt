00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
very very worthwhile going through the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.980 
very very worthwhile going through the
training<00:02:03.659> mode<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
training mode so here we have got to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
training mode so here we have got to
push<00:02:07.320> triangle<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> move<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> cue<00:02:08.610> ball<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.149> we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
push triangle to move the cue ball so we

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
push triangle to move the cue ball so we
can<00:02:09.569> push<00:02:09.720> triangle<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.370> can

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
can push triangle and then we can

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.850 
can push triangle and then we can
actually<00:02:11.819> move

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
actually move

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.500 
actually move
are<00:02:13.010> Cubans<00:02:13.550> positioned<00:02:14.030> we're<00:02:14.330> going<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
are Cubans positioned we're going to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.810 
are Cubans positioned we're going to
keep<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> central<00:02:15.500> position<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
keep it in the central position for the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.170 
keep it in the central position for the
first<00:02:17.060> shot<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.070> then<00:02:19.070> we<00:02:19.160> can<00:02:19.310> set<00:02:19.550> our<00:02:19.730> pace

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
first shot and then we can set our pace

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.410 
first shot and then we can set our pace
on<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.590> how<00:02:21.770> hard<00:02:22.160> we're<00:02:23.120> going

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.450 
on here so this is how hard we're going
to<00:02:23.540> actually<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:24.050> strike<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> ball<00:02:25.070> just

on this right hand meter here so we're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.430 
on this right hand meter here so we're
going<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.100> go<00:02:28.160> quite<00:02:28.580> hard<00:02:29.020> sort<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.080> shot<00:02:30.320> on

tack this bottom button and then it's a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.400 
tack this bottom button and then it's a
matter<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.850> taking<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.720> shot<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.290> we're

the ball like this and we get lines
indicating<00:03:14.860> whereabouts<00:03:16.060> we're<00:03:17.060> going<00:03:17.330> to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
indicating whereabouts we're going to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.180 
indicating whereabouts we're going to
actually<00:03:17.600> be<00:03:17.840> hitting<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.500> ball<00:03:18.860> and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
actually be hitting that ball and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.620 
actually be hitting that ball and
whereabouts<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:19.790> gonna<00:03:19.910> go<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.150> we<00:03:20.480> can

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
whereabouts it's gonna go to we can

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.000 
whereabouts it's gonna go to we can
swing<00:03:20.900> all<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.140> way<00:03:21.230> around<00:03:21.470> here<00:03:21.709> as<00:03:21.830> well

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
swing all the way around here as well

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.490 
swing all the way around here as well
perhaps<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.549> want<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.790> go<00:03:22.910> for<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:24.019> one<00:03:24.350> in

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
perhaps we want to go for this one in

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.920 
perhaps we want to go for this one in
that<00:03:24.620> top<00:03:24.920> pocket<00:03:25.130> we<00:03:26.030> can<00:03:26.180> also<00:03:26.299> change<00:03:26.750> to

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that top pocket we can also change to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.630 
that top pocket we can also change to
top<00:03:27.290> view<00:03:27.530> by<00:03:27.560> hitting<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.160> right<00:03:28.370> shoulder

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
top view by hitting the right shoulder

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.840 
top view by hitting the right shoulder
button<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.660> up<00:03:29.959> here<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.430> sort<00:03:31.670> hit

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
button just up here so I can sort hit

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.000 
button just up here so I can sort hit
this<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.660> changes<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.200> view<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.739> top

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
this and that changes the view to a top

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.060 
this and that changes the view to a top
down<00:03:34.250> view<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.820> I<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.900> also<00:03:36.049> increase<00:03:36.650> my

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
down view and I can also increase my

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.370 
down view and I can also increase my
power<00:03:37.340> on<00:03:37.580> this<00:03:37.760> shot<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.810> increases

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
power on this shot and that increases

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.100 
power on this shot and that increases
the<00:03:39.590> yellow<00:03:39.890> guideline<00:03:40.580> there<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.810> looks

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
the yellow guideline there so it looks

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.590 
the yellow guideline there so it looks
like<00:03:42.350> we're<00:03:42.560> almost<00:03:42.680> on<00:03:43.010> target<00:03:43.519> there<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.510> we

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
like we're almost on target there so we

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.110 
like we're almost on target there so we
shall<00:03:44.810> hit<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.110> once<00:03:45.380> more<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.010> we're<00:03:46.910> going

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.150 
too hot we go for this yellow one and we
go<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.699> top-down<00:04:41.910> view<00:04:42.330> again<00:04:43.009> so<00:04:44.009> we

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
go for the top-down view again so we

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.240 
go for the top-down view again so we
need<00:04:44.340> more<00:04:44.580> power<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:46.620> then<00:04:46.830> we<00:04:46.949> can<00:04:47.099> adjust

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
need more power and then we can adjust

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.790 
need more power and then we can adjust
the<00:04:47.910> angular<00:04:48.479> shot<00:04:48.750> wise<00:04:48.990> we're<00:04:49.259> in<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.560> view

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
the angular shot wise we're in this view

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.480 
the angular shot wise we're in this view
and<00:04:50.160> it<00:04:50.940> moves<00:04:51.150> quite<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:51.449> lot<00:04:51.860> but<00:04:52.860> if<00:04:52.979> we<00:04:53.160> hold

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
and it moves quite a lot but if we hold

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.249 
and it moves quite a lot but if we hold
down<00:04:53.699> I<00:04:53.940> think<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.479> safe<00:04:54.720> we<00:04:54.870> hold<00:04:55.080> down

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
down I think it's safe we hold down

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.320 
down I think it's safe we hold down
circle<00:04:55.699> whilst<00:04:56.699> we're<00:04:56.940> making<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
circle whilst we're making the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.080 
circle whilst we're making the
adjustments<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:57.990> does<00:04:58.169> finer<00:04:58.500> adjustments<00:04:59.190> so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
adjustments it does finer adjustments so

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.060 
adjustments it does finer adjustments so
now<00:05:00.270> we're<00:05:00.509> doing<00:05:00.660> final<00:05:01.349> adjustments<00:05:01.860> whilst

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
now we're doing final adjustments whilst

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:22.100 
now we're doing final adjustments whilst
holding<00:05:02.340> this<00:05:13.070> band-aid<00:05:19.610> there<00:05:20.610> we<00:05:20.759> go<00:05:21.080> so<00:05:22.080> now

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
holding this band-aid there we go so now

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.939 
holding this band-aid there we go so now
we're<00:05:22.470> gonna<00:05:22.710> go<00:05:22.889> back<00:05:23.099> into<00:05:23.280> normal<00:05:23.759> view<00:05:23.789> and

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
we're gonna go back into normal view and

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.350 
we're gonna go back into normal view and
normal<00:05:25.949> view<00:05:26.310> again<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:26.849> now<00:05:26.970> we're<00:05:27.120> ready<00:05:27.270> to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
normal view again so now we're ready to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.570 
normal view again so now we're ready to
take<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.810> shot<00:05:31.909> and<00:05:33.380> we<00:05:34.380> plotted<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:34.919> again<00:05:35.220> so

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
take the shot and we plotted it again so

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.800 
take the shot and we plotted it again so
you<00:05:35.639> get<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:35.940> idea<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.300> as<00:05:36.449> you<00:05:36.570> progress

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
you get the idea and as you progress

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.920 
you get the idea and as you progress
through<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.349> game<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:38.280> earn<00:05:38.490> extra<00:05:39.090> sort<00:05:39.840> of

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
through the game you earn extra sort of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.520 
through the game you earn extra sort of
money<00:05:40.349> up<00:05:40.680> here<00:05:40.710> for<00:05:41.340> wages<00:05:41.849> and<00:05:42.349> he<00:05:43.349> basically

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
money up here for wages and he basically

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.279 
money up here for wages and he basically
got<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.889> clear<00:05:44.219> all<00:05:44.880> of<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.210> balls<00:05:45.449> off<00:05:45.780> of<00:05:46.229> the

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
got a clear all of the balls off of the

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:54.700 
got a clear all of the balls off of the
table

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.620 

graphics<00:05:55.710> are<00:05:55.860> noise<00:05:55.980> sounds<00:05:56.970> pretty<00:05:57.210> nice<00:05:57.420> as

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
graphics are noise sounds pretty nice as

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.100 
graphics are noise sounds pretty nice as
well<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:58.440> control<00:05:58.860> method<00:05:59.250> not<00:05:59.760> too<00:06:00.120> keen<00:06:01.080> on

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
well the control method not too keen on

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.960 
well the control method not too keen on
the<00:06:01.320> control<00:06:01.740> method<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.280> know<00:06:02.520> there's<00:06:02.760> not<00:06:02.880> a

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
the control method I know there's not a

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.610 
the control method I know there's not a
lot<00:06:03.000> they<00:06:03.330> could<00:06:03.390> have<00:06:03.600> done<00:06:03.720> with<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:04.020> but<00:06:04.590> I

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
lot they could have done with it but I

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.440 
lot they could have done with it but I
just<00:06:04.950> think<00:06:05.250> they<00:06:05.640> could<00:06:05.910> have<00:06:06.060> made<00:06:06.240> it<00:06:06.390> a

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
just think they could have made it a

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.320 
just think they could have made it a
little<00:06:07.020> bit<00:06:07.230> more<00:06:07.470> intuitive<00:06:08.460> let's<00:06:09.000> just<00:06:09.180> try

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
little bit more intuitive let's just try

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.420 
little bit more intuitive let's just try
one<00:06:09.360> more<00:06:09.750> shot<00:06:10.340> I<00:06:11.340> wish<00:06:11.760> we'd<00:06:12.000> go<00:06:12.180> for<00:06:13.430> don't

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
one more shot I wish we'd go for don't

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.950 
one more shot I wish we'd go for don't
think<00:06:14.610> I'm<00:06:14.670> gonna<00:06:14.790> actually<00:06:14.940> put<00:06:15.720> anything

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
think I'm gonna actually put anything

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.420 
think I'm gonna actually put anything
this<00:06:16.230> time<00:06:16.440> we're<00:06:16.590> try<00:06:16.740> and<00:06:16.860> double<00:06:17.100> this<00:06:17.220> one

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
this time we're try and double this one

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.580 
this time we're try and double this one
up<00:06:17.580> just<00:06:17.730> on<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.060> little<00:06:18.660> bit<00:06:18.960> of<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.110> fluke<00:06:19.410> II

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
up just on a little bit of a fluke II

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.070 
up just on a little bit of a fluke II
shot<00:06:19.880> actually<00:06:20.880> let's<00:06:21.480> give<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.690> a<00:06:21.780> bit<00:06:21.930> more

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
shot actually let's give it a bit more

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.030 
shot actually let's give it a bit more
power<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:26.630> we<00:06:27.630> missed<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.020> shot<00:06:28.200> but<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:28.920> get

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
power and we missed the shot but you get

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.300 
power and we missed the shot but you get
the<00:06:29.130> idea<00:06:29.160> so<00:06:29.750> not<00:06:30.750> a<00:06:30.780> bad<00:06:30.990> game<00:06:31.230> I<00:06:31.560> think<00:06:32.040> it's

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
the idea so not a bad game I think it's

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.700 
the idea so not a bad game I think it's
pretty<00:06:32.730> nice<00:06:32.970> let<00:06:33.870> me<00:06:33.960> just<00:06:34.140> come<00:06:34.350> back<00:06:34.470> out<00:06:34.650> to

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
pretty nice let me just come back out to

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.740 
pretty nice let me just come back out to
the<00:06:35.930> menu<00:06:36.930> of<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:37.590> PS<00:06:37.860> Vita<00:06:38.700> just<00:06:39.360> to<00:06:39.480> show<00:06:39.690> you

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
the menu of the PS Vita just to show you

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.680 
the menu of the PS Vita just to show you
that<00:06:40.020> icon<00:06:40.440> once<00:06:40.680> more<00:06:40.970> so<00:06:41.970> here<00:06:42.270> we<00:06:42.360> go<00:06:42.480> that

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
that icon once more so here we go that

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.930 
that icon once more so here we go that
was<00:06:42.780> Hustle<00:06:43.380> Kings<00:06:43.620> I<00:06:43.890> think<00:06:44.490> it's<00:06:44.580> a<00:06:44.640> pretty

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
was Hustle Kings I think it's a pretty

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.350 
was Hustle Kings I think it's a pretty
good<00:06:45.120> game<00:06:45.300> I<00:06:45.630> think<00:06:46.280> it's<00:06:47.280> sort<00:06:47.520> of<00:06:47.640> limited<00:06:48.120> I

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
good game I think it's sort of limited I

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.870 
good game I think it's sort of limited I
suppose<00:06:48.810> so<00:06:49.170> it<00:06:49.320> can<00:06:49.650> get<00:06:49.860> quite<00:06:49.920> boring<00:06:50.490> quite

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
suppose so it can get quite boring quite

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.780 
suppose so it can get quite boring quite
easily<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.510> control<00:06:52.440> method<00:06:52.830> could<00:06:53.640> have

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
easily the control method could have

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.700 
easily the control method could have
been<00:06:53.910> better<00:06:54.120> but<00:06:54.510> overall<00:06:54.690> pretty<00:06:54.990> good<00:06:55.530> game

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
been better but overall pretty good game

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.830 
been better but overall pretty good game
