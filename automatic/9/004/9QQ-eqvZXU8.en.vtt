watching these cutscenes I thought to

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.809 
watching these cutscenes I thought to
myself<00:01:01.499> why<00:01:02.499> didn't<00:01:02.890> they<00:01:02.980> make<00:01:03.159> this<00:01:03.429> into<00:01:03.789> a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
myself why didn't they make this into a

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.580 
myself why didn't they make this into a
filler<00:01:04.150> it's<00:01:04.420> way<00:01:04.750> more<00:01:04.780> infinitely

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
filler it's way more infinitely

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.250 
filler it's way more infinitely
interesting<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.820> only<00:01:07.330> negative<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.960> have

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.380 
interesting the only negative I have
about<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:08.950> cutscenes<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.610> this<00:01:09.820> game<00:01:10.090> is<00:01:10.329> that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
about the cutscenes in this game is that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.120 
about the cutscenes in this game is that
you<00:01:10.570> don't<00:01:10.750> get<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.049> see<00:01:11.079> the<00:01:11.350> full<00:01:11.530> fight<00:01:11.890> of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
because basically Orochimaru just says

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.870 
because basically Orochimaru just says
he's<00:02:17.170> been<00:02:17.410> researching<00:02:18.190> the

he's been researching the
he<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.390> then<00:02:19.720> after<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.350> end<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.620> battle

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
he and then after the end of the battle

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.590 
he and then after the end of the battle
when<00:02:20.980> he<00:02:21.040> gets<00:02:21.190> his<00:02:21.310> ass<00:02:21.430> handed<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.820> him<00:02:21.940> he

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
when he gets his ass handed to him he

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.420 
when he gets his ass handed to him he
says<00:02:22.810> oh<00:02:22.960> no<00:02:23.440> i've<00:02:23.590> actually<00:02:23.800> been<00:02:23.980> wanting<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
join the entire time but this is all

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.470 
join the entire time but this is all
because<00:02:26.770> Orochimaru<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:28.300> artist

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
because Orochimaru is a artist

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.510 
because Orochimaru is a artist
but<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.020> main<00:02:29.260> reason<00:02:29.290> he<00:02:29.740> decides<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.280> join

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
but the main reason he decides to join

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.060 
but the main reason he decides to join
is<00:02:30.880> because<00:02:31.450> he<00:02:31.570> notices<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.440> pain<00:02:32.740> guy

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
is because he notices that this pain guy

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.760 
is because he notices that this pain guy
actually<00:02:33.490> has<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.850> Rinnegan<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.990> he<00:02:35.560> gets

through<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.070> game<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.400> we<00:03:09.700> actually<00:03:09.820> get<00:03:10.090> to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
through this game and we actually get to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.240 
through this game and we actually get to
learn<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.930> not<00:03:11.080> only<00:03:11.290> was<00:03:11.560> he<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.740> member<00:03:11.980> of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
learn that not only was he a member of

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.430

the<00:03:12.280> Josh<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.760> religion<00:03:13.300> but<00:03:13.750> he<00:03:13.900> was<00:03:14.020> actually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the Josh in religion but he was actually

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.230 
the Josh in religion but he was actually
an<00:03:14.530> experiment<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.310> was<00:03:15.370> created<00:03:15.700> by<00:03:16.000> them

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
an experiment that was created by them

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640 
an experiment that was created by them
and<00:03:16.360> that's<00:03:16.510> why<00:03:16.660> he<00:03:16.870> has<00:03:17.020> his<00:03:17.230> immortal

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
and that's why he has his immortal

get to see Itachi and Kisame and that's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.730 
get to see Itachi and Kisame and that's
because<00:04:09.970> Toby<00:04:10.480> already<00:04:10.720> has<00:04:10.870> relationships

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
because Toby already has relationships

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.110 
because Toby already has relationships
with<00:04:11.830> them<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.310> we<00:04:12.400> already<00:04:12.640> know<00:04:12.760> how<00:04:12.940> that's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
with them and we already know how that's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.310 
with them and we already know how that's
really<00:04:13.360> going<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.510> go<00:04:13.660> down<00:04:13.840> anyway

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
really going to go down anyway

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.930 
really going to go down anyway
especially<00:04:14.830> because<00:04:15.310> he<00:04:15.340> saw<00:04:15.670> me<00:04:15.730> would

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
especially because he saw me would

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.729 
especially because he saw me would
probably<00:04:16.359> just<00:04:16.540> go<00:04:16.750> ahead<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.020> go<00:04:17.260> with<00:04:17.290> Toby

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
probably just go ahead and go with Toby

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.470 
probably just go ahead and go with Toby
anyway<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.370> that's<00:04:18.670> because<00:04:18.910> he<00:04:19.150> knew<00:04:19.330> that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
anyway and that's because he knew that

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.840 
anyway and that's because he knew that
he<00:04:19.600> was<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.870> former<00:04:20.109> meizu<00:04:20.530> cog<00:04:20.770> a<00:04:20.980> but<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:21.730> is

he was the former meizu cog a but it is

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.370 
he was the former meizu cog a but it is
very<00:04:21.940> nice<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.450> ominous<00:04:22.840> when<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.050> see<00:04:23.230> them

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
very nice and ominous when you see them

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.930 
very nice and ominous when you see them

this<00:04:30.880> was<00:04:31.060> a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
this was a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.840 
this was a
great<00:04:31.530> expansion<00:04:32.010> on<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.280> Akatsuki

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
great expansion on the Akatsuki

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.850 
great expansion on the Akatsuki
organization<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.630> one<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.080> massively

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
organization and one that is a massively

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.740 
organization and one that is a massively
missed<00:04:35.190> opportunity<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.360> they<00:04:36.450> could<00:04:36.660> have

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
missed opportunity that they could have

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.150 
missed opportunity that they could have
done<00:04:36.900> by<00:04:37.080> expanding<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.680> in<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.860> anime

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
done by expanding it in the anime

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.560 
done by expanding it in the anime
version<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.760> giving<00:04:39.000> us<00:04:39.090> something<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.420> I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
version and giving us something that I

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.820 
version and giving us something that I
think<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.870> fans<00:04:40.140> would<00:04:40.290> have<00:04:40.410> really<00:04:40.680> wanted
