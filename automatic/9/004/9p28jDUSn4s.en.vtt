00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.250
 the balance I think you have to do it there 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.260
 to look at the results exclusively 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.959
 in the results have to be the 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.850
 consequence of a job and then in 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.170
 that sense we are happy about everything 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.680
 not with the results that have been 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.350
 good but with the progression especially 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.310
 of most players a little 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.940
 it was what is pre-season is looking 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 during the entire season of 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.300
 that there are players who have 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.270
 progression than the concepts that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.220
 work are at the end of the season 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 well understood and we believe that in general 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.809
 in general, the season was 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 good where winning is a consequence of 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.020
 what he does is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.989
 during during the match or during the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.040
 week during the month or during the year 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.540
 it is not worth wanting to win if yes to win it 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.809
 you do things well normally for 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.360
 win you have to do things the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.420
 things well you can not win certain 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.580
 matches but at the end of the year they can be 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.320
 there may be very few who want 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.470
 without doing things right then what 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.210
 what is treated during the year 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.190
 it's good to go working certain 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.700
 certain details so that later during 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.220
 the match so those are produced 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.820
 details in the field and usually if 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.080
 you work those details well 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.970
 you have more chances to win 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.950
 logically then I think it 's a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.810
 consequence do not do things right in 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.840
 a match is a consequence of having more 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.700
 chances to win if beginning 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 good to finish 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.399
 last season let leave everything 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 closed forever fringes and the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.530
 because if you're tying many of them 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.440
 with the new season started 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.550
 then good first 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.430
 and try to leave everything closed and 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.850
 logically with the preseason that there 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.950
 the youth started the week of 23 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 July 24 it's like a wheel 77 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.660
 sum everything and but good we are already 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.580
 we are running with the with the new 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.410
 12-13 season and well then once 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.600
 the kids have begun to train 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.760
 well, things go rolling and they come out 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.180
 the situations that may come out 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.180
 usually if they have been a month 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.830
 training and logically good the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.230
 summer tournaments serve and come go 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.210
 for the players to go see the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.610
 level they have but the competition I 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.790
 I think for them it's something different and 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.010
 start against the opponent of the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.590
 level of the athletic that you know that 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.160
 good that will be up there in the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.740
 competition logically then it is a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.220
 stimulating more yes good things things of 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.600
 these can happen and for that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.280
 we have to be prepared and what is not 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.540
 we have to do at this moment is 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.450
 precipitate us in good then in covering the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.120
 absence of beÃ±at in going out to see see 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.570
 well what is what are the needs 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.030
 inside the structure and if with someone 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.980
 inside the structure you can can 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.810
 close to do it and if not then search 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.040
 someone who at this moment is not 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.170
 working for for the real 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.849
 but what do we think is good that can be 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.349
 an appropriate profile and that is not for 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.150
 catch a low in a moment 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.700
 determined but you can stay with 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.959
 us for many years if in this 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.280
 moment we are we are 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.400
 arranging like that but of course it's not the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.819
 better situation and we will try good 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.829
 then close with each technician in his 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.480
 template in its category then as before 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.389
 possible but as I said before you have to 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.209
 be a decision other than to cover 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.579
 for a few months but if not good 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.109
 if there is going to be someone who in 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.909
 structure of the real good then look 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.220
 the right profile so that we can 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.349
 help for many years I believe that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.680
 It is that what is important is 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.209
 important to be training players to 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.639
 to reach the first team 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.960
 going through the sanse many times then 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.389
 technicians 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.750
 in an opportunity also to go 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.440
 forming themselves and having the possibility 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.689
 to get to take some more steps 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.269
 I believe that 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.419
 good, well, we have the example of 

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:44.849
 better also that is with the second 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.439
 team and has gone through the 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.809
 lower categories not then I think 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:53.839
 that it is important that everything 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:56.610
 that these technicians are acquiring the 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:58.439
 good workouts then of a 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.869
 professional team not in a team of 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:03.809
 first division at this time as 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:05.579
 how is the first team 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:08.339
 Well, everything will be enriching 

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:11.479
 for them and beneficial to go 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:14.550
 well, accumulating more information and 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.639
 logically good because I already have 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.849
 small small doses of what is the 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.580
 high competition at the elite level 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.159
 Well, I think it's normally 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.999
 Excluded with most clubs 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.319
 with logically with some the relationship 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.879
 Well, it's simply because of the relationship 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.490
 staff can be better than with other 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:39.990
 but at this moment in general I would say 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.539
 it's good that the relationship that the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.819
 social network with the agreed clubs 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.399
 especially Guipuzcoans both of your 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.199
 pictures as Gipuzkoa is good and 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.029
 we will try that throughout this 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.069
 Yes growing season is better than 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.820
 we can reach the needs that 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.580
 can have them 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:03.430
 and logically get more information 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:06.620
 of how at what time they are and 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.770
 what can we help them with, since I 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.890
 I think it's not the feeling that I can 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.970
 that I can feel someone from whom 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.530
 we are here inside but the public in 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:23.090
 general of the follower of the real in 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:25.550
 general to see that the majority of the 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.220
 group the main block of the first 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.260
 template 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.290
 at this moment it is nourished by 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.510
 players who have left who have been 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.400
 many years in his diet good then I 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.870
 I think it's very important that it's very 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 difficult to compete at a professional level 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.560
 we are I think we are all 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.330
 convinced that it is that way and the power 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.130
 do it with most people from 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.520
 house because logically it is a pride for 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.520
 we
