actually<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.710> thrust<00:00:52.710> test<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
actually a thrust test so I have it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170 
actually a thrust test so I have it
hooked<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.649> scale<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:56.969> run

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
hooked up to my scale and I'm gonna run

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.840 
hooked up to my scale and I'm gonna run
it<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.629> 50%<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:59.070> hundred<00:00:59.340> percent<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it up at 50% and a hundred percent to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.290 
it up at 50% and a hundred percent to
see<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> thrust<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

as<00:01:10.049> well<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:11.700> mention<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> few<00:01:12.150> things<00:01:12.210> about

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
as well just mention a few things about

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.870 
as well just mention a few things about
these<00:01:12.720> motors<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.770> come<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.189> clockwise<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
these motors they come in clockwise and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
these motors they come in clockwise and
counter<00:01:15.150> clockwise<00:01:15.500> meaning<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.280> hub

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
counter clockwise meaning for this hub

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.840 
counter clockwise meaning for this hub
the<00:01:18.540> propeller<00:01:18.930> hub<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:20.040> holds<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> prop<00:01:20.670> on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the propeller hub that holds the prop on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.690 
the propeller hub that holds the prop on
this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> nut<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.070> either<00:01:23.189> screw<00:01:23.549> on

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
this is nut it can either screw on

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
this is nut it can either screw on
clockwise<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.270> counter<00:01:24.509> clockwise<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.320> if

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
clockwise or counter clockwise so if

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
clockwise or counter clockwise so if
you're<00:01:25.860> running<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.130> quad<00:01:26.400> you'd<00:01:26.640> need<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you're running a quad you'd need to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.569 
you're running a quad you'd need to
counter<00:01:27.659> clockwise<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.530> clockwise<00:01:29.189> just

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
counter clockwise and to clockwise just

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
counter clockwise and to clockwise just
so<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:30.990> spin<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:31.320> such

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so that the because these spin at such

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.700 
so that the because these spin at such
high<00:01:31.500> speeds<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.700> prop<00:01:33.630> nuts<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.320> come

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
high speeds these prop nuts don't come

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.630 
high speeds these prop nuts don't come
off<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.509> ordered<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.630> clockwise<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
off I ordered all clockwise just so that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
off I ordered all clockwise just so that
I<00:01:38.670> had<00:01:39.000> interchangeability<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> parts

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I had interchangeability of the parts

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.999 
I had interchangeability of the parts
and<00:01:42.020> all<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.500> throw<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.829> lock

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and all I do is I throw a little lock

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.319 
and all I do is I throw a little lock
tight<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.790> hadn't<00:01:45.119> had<00:01:45.240> any

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
tight on it and I hadn't had any

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.300 
tight on it and I hadn't had any
problems<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> at<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> quality

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
problems with it at all so the quality

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.149 
problems with it at all so the quality
so<00:01:50.790> far<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.360> motors<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.110> ordered<00:01:52.860> five

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
so far of these motors I ordered five

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.170 
so far of these motors I ordered five
and<00:01:54.619> one<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:56.040> four<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:56.850> were<00:01:56.969> fine

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and one of them four of them were fine

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.850 
and one of them four of them were fine
one<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.350> were<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:59.060> what<00:02:00.060> happened<00:02:00.479> was

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
one of them were not what happened was

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.490 
one of them were not what happened was
it<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.100> grinding<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.659> armature

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it was a grinding it was this armature

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
it was a grinding it was this armature
the<00:02:04.979> armature<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.700> inside<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.509> grinding

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the armature and inside was grinding

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.080 
the armature and inside was grinding
against<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> magnets<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.009> believe<00:02:08.280> because

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
against the magnets I believe because

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.700 
against the magnets I believe because
when<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> was<00:02:09.660> spinning<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> would<00:02:10.379> make<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
when I was spinning this it would make a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.160 
when I was spinning this it would make a
you<00:02:12.710> could<00:02:12.860> just<00:02:13.010> hear<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.640> rubbing<00:02:14.240> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
you could just hear it just rubbing and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.600 
you could just hear it just rubbing and
what<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.440> was<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:16.209> took<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.300> apart<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.610> these

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
what it was I took it apart and these

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.330 
what it was I took it apart and these
magnets<00:02:20.090> were<00:02:20.270> loose<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.720> actually<00:02:21.530> five<00:02:22.100> of

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
magnets were loose and actually five of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.770 
magnets were loose and actually five of
the<00:02:22.430> magnets<00:02:22.819> were<00:02:22.940> loose<00:02:23.120> they<00:02:23.300> all<00:02:23.480> popped

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the magnets were loose they all popped

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.160 
the magnets were loose they all popped
right<00:02:23.990> out

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
right out

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.290 
right out
now<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.319> haven't<00:02:24.620> glued<00:02:24.800> back<00:02:25.069> in<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.490> used<00:02:26.060> some

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
now I haven't glued back in I used some

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.370 
now I haven't glued back in I used some
five-minute<00:02:26.840> epoxy<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:28.310> just<00:02:29.200> seen<00:02:30.200> have

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
five-minute epoxy and I just seen have

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.090 
five-minute epoxy and I just seen have
it<00:02:30.560> all<00:02:30.800> nice<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.310> solid<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.500> quality<00:02:33.980> is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
it all nice and solid so the quality is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.580 
it all nice and solid so the quality is
the<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.730> quality<00:02:35.209> or<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.390> quality<00:02:35.930> control

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the the quality or the quality control

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.380 
the the quality or the quality control
of<00:02:36.620> these<00:02:36.920> motors<00:02:37.340> don't<00:02:37.520> doesn't<00:02:38.180> seem<00:02:38.360> that

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
of these motors don't doesn't seem that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.270 
of these motors don't doesn't seem that
to<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.230> back<00:02:39.410> great

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
to be back great

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.350 
to be back great
now<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:43.040> runs<00:02:43.280> nice<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.640> smooth<00:02:43.910> now<00:02:45.070> so

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
now this runs nice and smooth now so

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.640 
now this runs nice and smooth now so
just<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.510> careful<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:47.989> when<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.350> order

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
just be careful of that when you order

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.449 
just be careful of that when you order
them<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.870> let's<00:02:50.870> let's<00:02:51.800> take<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.070> on<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> bench

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
them so let's let's take it on the bench

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.449 
them so let's let's take it on the bench
and<00:02:52.989> fire<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.170> up<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.920> see<00:02:55.070> what<00:02:55.190> kind<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
and fire it up and see what kind of

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.080 
and fire it up and see what kind of
numbers<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:55.910> get<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:58.370> wanted<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.970> mention

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
numbers we get I just wanted to mention

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.180 
numbers we get I just wanted to mention
quickly<00:02:59.450> a<00:03:00.080> couple<00:03:00.590> other<00:03:00.709> little<00:03:01.010> things

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
quickly a couple other little things

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.500 
quickly a couple other little things
about<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.519> motor<00:03:01.730> before<00:03:01.880> we<00:03:02.120> do<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.330> thrust

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
about this motor before we do the thrust

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.800 
about this motor before we do the thrust
test<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:04.160> shaft<00:03:04.850> here<00:03:05.269> where<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> prop

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
test this the shaft here where the prop

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.130 
test this the shaft here where the prop
actually<00:03:06.320> goes<00:03:07.040> onto<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.489> motor<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:08.630> 5

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
actually goes onto the motor is 5

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.780 
actually goes onto the motor is 5
millimeter<00:03:09.620> which<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:09.890> exactly<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.760> same

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
millimeter which is exactly the same

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.100 
millimeter which is exactly the same
size<00:03:11.150> as<00:03:11.420> these<00:03:11.600> gem<00:03:11.870> fan<00:03:12.320> hubs<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:17.110> shaft

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
size as these gem fan hubs the shaft

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.569 
size as these gem fan hubs the shaft
itself<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.280> inside<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:20.600> 2<00:03:21.140> millimeter<00:03:21.709> so

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
itself on the inside is 2 millimeter so

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.449 
itself on the inside is 2 millimeter so
it's<00:03:22.790> kind<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.690> kind<00:03:23.959> of<00:03:23.989> flimsy<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:24.709> who

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
it's kind of it's kind of flimsy but who

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.580 
it's kind of it's kind of flimsy but who
knows<00:03:25.670> we'll<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.600> they<00:03:26.870> are<00:03:26.959> small<00:03:27.290> motors

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
knows we'll see they are small motors

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.530 
knows we'll see they are small motors
I'm<00:03:28.040> not<00:03:28.220> sure<00:03:28.430> what<00:03:28.579> size<00:03:28.760> they<00:03:29.060> are<00:03:29.090> for<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
I'm not sure what size they are for the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.569 
I'm not sure what size they are for the
sunny<00:03:29.750> skies<00:03:30.019> or<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.500> tiger<00:03:30.680> motors<00:03:31.130> but<00:03:31.400> this

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
sunny skies or the tiger motors but this

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.340 
sunny skies or the tiger motors but this
one<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:31.970> 2<00:03:32.180> millimeter<00:03:33.700> right<00:03:34.700> here

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
one here is 2 millimeter right here

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.949 
one here is 2 millimeter right here
where<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.920> wires<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.329> three<00:03:38.540> wires<00:03:38.750> come

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
where the wires the the three wires come

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.560 
where the wires the the three wires come
out<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.350> motor<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:40.489> will<00:03:41.209> probably<00:03:41.329> put

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
out of the motor I will probably put

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.870 
out of the motor I will probably put
some<00:03:41.690> epoxy<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.230> here<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.370> keep<00:03:43.549> these<00:03:43.730> from

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
some epoxy on here so to keep these from

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.789 
some epoxy on here so to keep these from
fatiguing<00:03:44.480> over<00:03:44.720> time<00:03:44.959> they'll<00:03:45.500> probably

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
fatiguing over time they'll probably

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.270 
fatiguing over time they'll probably
break<00:03:46.280> those<00:03:46.489> are<00:03:46.610> very<00:03:46.790> thin<00:03:47.090> wires<00:03:47.450> just

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
break those are very thin wires just

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.470 
break those are very thin wires just
from<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.400> vibration<00:03:49.940> when<00:03:50.180> you're<00:03:50.329> flying

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
from the vibration when you're flying

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.660 
from the vibration when you're flying
and<00:03:50.810> stuff<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.049> could<00:03:51.440> be<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> weak<00:03:51.890> point<00:03:52.130> so

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
and stuff that could be a weak point so

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.789 
and stuff that could be a weak point so
okay<00:03:53.150> I'm<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.780> gonna<00:03:53.870> grab<00:03:54.079> my<00:03:54.140> my

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
okay I'm just gonna grab my my

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.199 
okay I'm just gonna grab my my
transmitter<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:55.880> we'll<00:03:56.000> get<00:03:56.090> started

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
transmitter and then we'll get started

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.330 
transmitter and then we'll get started
with<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.959> thrust<00:03:57.620> test<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:58.280> have<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.260> ammeter

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
with the thrust test I have the ammeter

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.729 
with the thrust test I have the ammeter
hooked<00:04:01.340> up<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:03.260> we'll<00:04:03.350> be<00:04:03.470> able<00:04:03.530> to

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
hooked up to it so we'll be able to

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.970 
hooked up to it so we'll be able to
check<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.160> max<00:04:04.640> amps<00:04:05.030> drawn<00:04:05.510> at<00:04:05.840> 50%<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.739> 100%

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
check the max amps drawn at 50% and 100%

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.120 
check the max amps drawn at 50% and 100%
along<00:04:07.820> with<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.299> thrust<00:04:08.600> okay<00:04:09.290> we'll<00:04:10.040> get

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
along with the thrust okay we'll get

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:21.450 
along with the thrust okay we'll get
started

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.080 

all<00:04:22.460> right<00:04:22.580> 50%<00:04:23.330> throttle<00:04:24.640> zero<00:04:25.640> out<00:04:25.880> our

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
all right 50% throttle zero out our

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:40.420 
all right 50% throttle zero out our
scale

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.590 

so<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.550> was<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.700> hundred<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.180> fifty<00:04:42.450> five

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
so that was a hundred and fifty five

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.650 
so that was a hundred and fifty five
grams<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.260> thrust<00:04:44.420> drawing<00:04:45.440> two<00:04:46.440> amps<00:04:47.660> now

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
grams of thrust drawing two amps now

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:58.810 
grams of thrust drawing two amps now
we'll<00:04:48.870> do<00:04:49.050> full<00:04:49.650> throttle

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.720 

that<00:04:59.820> was<00:05:00.200> 330<00:05:01.200> grams<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.740> thrust<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.280> a

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
that was 330 grams of thrust and a

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:10.220 
that was 330 grams of thrust and a
maximum<00:05:03.120> draw<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:04.070> 5.5<00:05:05.070> amps<00:05:05.670> so<00:05:08.930> next<00:05:09.930> we're

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
maximum draw of 5.5 amps so next we're

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.810 
maximum draw of 5.5 amps so next we're
going<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.410> do<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.680> three<00:05:10.950> three<00:05:11.580> bladed

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
going to do the three three bladed

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.580 
going to do the three three bladed
propeller<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.810> I'll<00:05:12.900> get<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:13.050> mounted<00:05:13.470> up

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
propeller so I'll get that mounted up

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.370
