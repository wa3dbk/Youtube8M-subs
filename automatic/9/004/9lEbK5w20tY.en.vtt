00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
jailbroken um now there actually is good

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
jailbroken um now there actually is good
news<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.640> far<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> goes<00:00:48.149> there<00:00:48.960> actually

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
news as far as that goes there actually

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
news as far as that goes there actually
was<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.280> recently<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.030> new

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
was just very very recently a new

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
was just very very recently a new
exploit<00:00:51.870> found<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.379> 4.1<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> looks<00:00:54.329> like

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
exploit found in 4.1 so it looks like

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
exploit found in 4.1 so it looks like
before<00:00:55.230> too<00:00:55.410> long<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.460> full

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
before too long there will be a full

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479 
before too long there will be a full
jailbreak<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.750> 4.1<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.590> fantastic<00:00:58.800> I'm

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
jailbreak for 4.1 which is fantastic I'm

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430 
jailbreak for 4.1 which is fantastic I'm
so<00:01:00.059> actually<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so actually what it is is that there is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
so actually what it is is that there is
an<00:01:01.530> exploit<00:01:02.039> which<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.850> most<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
an exploit which I'm sure most of you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
an exploit which I'm sure most of you
guys<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:03.899> basically<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
guys know this but basically they have

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
guys know this but basically they have
an<00:01:05.519> exploit<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
an exploit but it's going to take a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.850 
an exploit but it's going to take a
little<00:01:06.840> while<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.560> build

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
little while for them to actually build

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.700 
little while for them to actually build
the<00:01:08.040> jailbreak<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:10.530> not

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the jailbreak around that so really not

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.710 
the jailbreak around that so really not
sure<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> will<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.540> guess

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
sure when it will be out I would guess

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140 
sure when it will be out I would guess
maybe<00:01:12.990> three<00:01:13.470> weeks<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:14.220> weeks<00:01:14.250> maybe<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
maybe three weeks two weeks maybe a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
maybe three weeks two weeks maybe a
month<00:01:15.210> I'll<00:01:15.689> guess<00:01:15.990> somewhere<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.710> time

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
month I'll guess somewhere in that time

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
month I'll guess somewhere in that time
range<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> could<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.210> less<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.750> be

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
range but it could be less it could be

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
range but it could be less it could be
more<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.140> kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> depends<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.860> how<00:01:20.100> how

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
more it just kind of depends on how how

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
more it just kind of depends on how how
easy<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> dev<00:01:22.170> team<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:22.590> ahead

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
easy it is for the dev team to go ahead

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
easy it is for the dev team to go ahead
and<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> done<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.509> 4.1

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and get it done but if you are on 4.1

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
and get it done but if you are on 4.1
