00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 again I was in the bathroom with the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.640
 pants lowered and already when I was going to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.589
 come here I would go back to 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.800
 put and I said what the fuck with the heat that 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.140
 makes me take them off better so 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.930
 I am 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.670
 hello good ok I'm going on Monday here in 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.720
 Pablo blogs and that means he is 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.910
 Monday today and today I want to talk about 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.500
 a trend an attitude that I've seen 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.990
 that has been happening in the past 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.790
 months that I did not like anything is something 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.860
 what's happening here on youtube and about 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.419
 everything is happening in our country in 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.800
 Spain first of all I want to say that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.480
 I am proud to say that I am 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.550
 Spanish I like my country I like their 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 traditions I like its climate many of 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
 my friends are from here my family 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.920
 obviously it 's from here and I was born I grew up 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.690
 here but I have to say that with the step 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.850
 of time has been traveling knowing 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.559
 other cultures other countries and every day 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.050
 I feel less Spanish or better than 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.539
 less Spanish I feel more citizen 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760
 of the world more than exclusively Spanish 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.620
 being a citizen of the world I have come to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.449
 appreciate certain things that happen 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.699
 in one country and that do not occur in others and 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.949
 specifically I come to talk about the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.140
 culture of envy that exists in 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.390
 Spain Spain because if there is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.400
 culture of envy despite who you 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.110
 weigh here when someone is doing well 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.450
 the things as it should and those things give 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.400
 fruits to the people instead of cheering and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.890
 of trying to get the same thing that 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.680
 person is engaged 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.570
 and kaka and mess with him and criticize him 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.060
 in general we are specifically going to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.220
 talk about youtube youtube case now 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.869
 it is very fashionable to say that there is a group 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 of people who only really believe that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.140
 there are people who are sold only 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.970
 they make videos on youtube for the money 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.009
 etcetera I for example in my case 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.110
 staff I earn money with this I 'm not going 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.060
 to deny I'm with a better one and with that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 my videos is not that I win a millionaire 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 but good some money continue but that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.850
 does not mean that five years ago when 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.619
 I started making videos this did 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.390
 for pure hobby and today follow it 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.160
 being for pure hobby in fact despite 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.570
 that I have a five-day routine to 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.550
 the week in the video or video as there 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.220
 some days that just not the video 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.380
 because I do not feel like it and to climb shit 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.240
 without meaning that I will not like or 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.100
 I prefer not to upload anything and upload 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.600
 the next day or wait more the week 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.520
 that comes or make a like without with 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.410
 you say a few weeks ago and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.420
 pass it on like a mother who is my case 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.739
 staff but then there are people who with 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.300
 the passage of time has tried to make 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.430
 grow your channels have you tried to create 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.170
 new content and apart from charging for 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 that has also left a paste in 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.620
 production team in paying about 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.329
 actors and all the things that you 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.310
 they require to do something of quality and 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.640
 people take away merit because he says that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.680
 is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.970
 a sold or a sold gentlemen 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.130
 sincerely, as is the economy 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.480
 in this country and more being young people the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.860
 who is consuming these videos that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.270
 They know perfectly how difficult it is 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.550
 get a job today in 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.860
 day what's wrong with profiting from 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.450
 something we do with love and love that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.490
 it started being our hobby and that over 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.920
 you who are the ones who see us do not 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.570
 they cost a penny that is something 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.340
 that surprises me sincerely and can 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.780
 that many people stuck and kaka to say 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.880
 what I am telling the truth is that 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.410
 I do not care, I do not want big masses 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.790
 of people watching me the truth that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.890
 from today I consider that I have a 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.410
 real audience of about 20 thousand people 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.940
 approximately number up the number 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.190
 down but if those 20 thousand people 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.780
 I feel that they are people who are faithful to what 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.459
 what I do and he likes what I do and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.650
 is critical of what I do and that is 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.720
 really what I want normal people 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.850
 seeing me I do not want or fans I do not want 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.040
 admirers I do not want stalkers 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.870
 I do not want this kind of thing I do not like it 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.489
 so what else does that give me for example 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.440
 a person as being blond 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.030
 having millions and millions of visits 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.590
 and of subscribers when in fact that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.450
 It does not affect me, I think 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.790
 It even makes me good because there is 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.650
 the blond although he has his fan boys and his 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.490
 fan girls that are going to say that everything 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.470
 what does 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.300
 on the internet is a copy of him there are many 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.830
 other people who start to see all the 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.960
 youtube world otherwise seeing 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.970
 success stories like his or like the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.340
 from my friend jp as the finger seek support 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.990
 they have given a twist to all the 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.390
 world of youtube and if they may be 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.610
 the nostalgic ones of before youtube was 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.510
 better before was less mainstream andrÃ©s 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.430
 bla bla bla 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.770
 I'm sorry for you I tell you here five years 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.660
 time has passed and I have followed in 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.580
 my channel has had changes and because it has 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.310
 had changes because one I changed 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.230
 and two the world we 're in is not 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.300
 the same as five years ago and the truth 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.550
 is that I think here or you adapt or 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.410
 okay you go if you do not like what you're 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.790
 watching but you 're not fucking the apple 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.350
 and criticizing people that nowadays 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.640
 is here stuck because if there is something 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.590
 good that youtube has is that the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.780
 content is purely created by 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.850
 normal people for normal people 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.500
 people who started from having nothing and that 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.480
 little by little has been getting the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.950
 things and that's where you should see the 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480
 value and not engage in criticizing the 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.400
 people when someone makes a campaign 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.500
 advertising but good as always 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.360
 I say this is only my opinion is 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.890
 something that really worries me is not that 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.540
 the big youtubers are out there 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.400
 asking people for money simply 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.639
 They are asking you to see 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.990
 in which they have put a lot of effort 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.759
 they have even invested money but if 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.169
 tell me you copied all this not 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.669
 forget to put a thumbs up if 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.020
 they liked the video share it with 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.570
