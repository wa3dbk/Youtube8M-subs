00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 southern university 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 his life is not engaged and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.649
 his state of health tends to improve 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.840
 these are the two main 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
 information about and rodolphe at 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
 day after the attack of squale whose 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 he was a victim to saint leu he is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.860

 university hospital center of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 saint pierre in the intensive care unit 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.020
 as soon as he arrived yesterday he suffered a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 first operation 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 others should follow very 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 quickly it must be said that the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 injuries in the forties are serious 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 and a question arises today 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 will he be able to retain the use of his 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 arm impossible to know today 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.659
 one of the pathways benefited from a long 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.860
 rehabilitation period 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.299
 only from there will he be 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.430
 possible to know if rodolphe 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.290
 will preserve or by sequelae this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.479
 shark attack an accident that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 intervene one year to the day after the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.810
 last shark attack that was 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.630
 produced and on this spot from the left to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.880
 saint leu and as after each attack 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 the prefecture launched its fishing plan 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.759
 sharks 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.500
 the device worked at night 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.270
 last a bulldog shark hurting 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.430
 two meters was captured at saint-leu 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 not far from the spot where the attack took place 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.820
 it is often wrongly thought that he is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.290
 forbidden to fish for shark on our 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.159
 island it's actually possible but in 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.930
 certain conditions 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.100
 since the beginning of the shark crisis on 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.090
 our island many ideas received 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 circulate 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.750
 the real fake of this 19 hours is signed 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.580
 lauras trianon 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.280
 are allowed to fish shark at the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.510
 meeting no legislation forbids the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.170
 shark fishing near the coast 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.820
 Reunion 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.290
 fishermen still have to 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.780
 submit to some rules 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.759
 the species first of all certain 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.450
 of them are protected as the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.600
 whale shark 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.310
 there is also the marine reserve every 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.140
 traditional fishing is 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.000
 allowed but since the last 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.680
 deadly attack the professionals 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.459
 see their fishing areas increased on 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.590
 exemption 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.820
 it goes from 80 to 95% of the area 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 now which is holding back the fishing of 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.190
 sharks it's the lack of profitability 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.269
 because since 1999 following several 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.560
 poisoning 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.120
 marketing is prohibited is there 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.010
 the right to surf 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 concretely surf is not forbidden to 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.510
 the meeting but for two years the access 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.269
 to different spots is no longer allowed 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.010
 a prefectural decree prohibits 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.450
 nautical activities in the band of 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.430
 300 meters from the coast 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.470
 they are only in the lagoon 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.930
 in the spaces to develop and in the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.500
 controlled areas with canoe bombs or 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.870
 black rocks 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.299
 if the weather conditions allow it and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.280
 that the nets are operational the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.410
 surfers can go to the water but for 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.769
 the moment only the recipients of the pole 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.720
 hopes can surf the meeting 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.730
 destination most affected by 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.230
 attacks 18 drama in four years the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.250
 meeting is part of the territories 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.380
 most affected 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.790
 it is also on par with the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.579
 united states and australia 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.170
 given the number of attacks this year 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.750
 but there have already been two deaths in our 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.049
 island against one in australia while to 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.579
 united states there were only wounded there 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.090
 are there conditions conducive to 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.430
 attacks 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.500
 these four dramas question the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.630
 favorable conditions for attacks 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.790
 seasonality first of all was like 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.930
 winter sharks no longer seems to be preferred 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.640
 period 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.350
 the situation has also changed in 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.239
 but the authorities 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.340
 always strongly advise against 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.350
 bathe when the water is cloudy and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.739
 to avoid doing it in the early morning or 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.329
 at the end of the day the sharks crisis that 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.040
 has been going on for four years now 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.930
 our island and the safety net at 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.180
 boom canoe you still do not seem 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.120
 adapted the recent strong swell have it 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.099
 damaged 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.629
 comes again to be repaired 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.790
 should be operational tomorrow 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.560
 the mns the inspector on before 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.060
 possibly 10 and green flags 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.890
 the city hall of saint paul which asks 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.810
 still patience to users and 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.519
 announces a larger and larger net 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.519
 solid it will be for the month of October
