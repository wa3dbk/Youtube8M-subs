00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.750
 and more 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.400
 hello friends from latin america 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.410
 welcome to be the Uruguayan channel of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.360
 technology today we're going to be chatting 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 a little about this little but very 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.090
 powerful gadget is the mini tv box 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 huawei media q m 310 we will explain the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.640
 it's a little bit how it works so that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640
 we are all going to understand 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.470
 well let's dedicate now to 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.450
 unboxing 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.810
 of the average huawei 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:49.200
 in women 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:50.970
 the box is simple but very elegant 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.620
 we have the gadget let's start 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.920
 then to describe that they are each of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.510
 the ports that you have on your sides 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.680
 but for now let's dedicate ourselves to see 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680
 what's inside the box 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 this is the power cord we are going to 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.930
 use them a bit 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.930
 the main horse 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.140
 good with a couple of batteries 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 the hdmi 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 a small start guide 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.650
 safety information 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.710
 the power connector 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.630
 the chemical remote control 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.630
 and here would be everything that comes in a 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 container 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.710
 ok let's see a little in the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.540
 physical characteristics of the device 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.330
 as we have is done in black and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.720
 metallic colors on the sides very 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.760
 simple yet elegant back here 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.660
 it has a little the specifications 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.429
 some of the characteristics of 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.490
 model 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.520
 It is a lightweight model 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.410
 has the ports to the sides by 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.410
 example here we have a usb port 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.440
 the audio output 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.910
 power input and a led 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.980
 corresponding that tells us if it is 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.099
 connected of course 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.420
 a micro sd input to extend the 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.420
 memory here we have an entry hdmi 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.610
 and of course the hdmi output that is 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.150
 where the cable that connects to the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 TV 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.580
 as for the internal characteristics 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.950
 of the apparatus we can say that it has a 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.210
 pretty quad-core processor 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.160
 powerful 1 gb of ram and 4 gigabytes of 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.100
 internal memory that of course it 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.930
 can extend up to 32 through the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.239
 sd card 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.310
 so that if half of Cuba is stolen through 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.049
 of this device we can transform 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.810
 our non-smart TV in a 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.239
 smart tv we connect the device of the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.650
 television through the hdmi port and the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.620
 same connects to the internet through 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.510
 a wifi network we will be able to navigate in 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.370
 internet watch videos on youtube and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.659
 use all the benefits of a 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.579
 normal smrtv something highlight of the huawei is 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.530
 that only works with devices with 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.060
 Android operating system indeed 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.250
 we have in the play store for our 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.989
 cell phone for our smartphone a 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.260
 application that transforms our 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.990
 phone on a remote control for 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.890
 dispositives 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.450
 connected once to the monitor presents 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.800
 a pretty friendly interface and 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.610
 simple and now we are going to show you 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.610
 previously 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.660
 good here we have the remote control of 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.120
 what is the average huawei that we see that is 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.610
 a device with few good buttons 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.430
 simple to use without any 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.680
 complication if we go to the screen 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.680
 let's see what is the first image that 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.970
 appears after the configuration of the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.820
 device with the TV 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.620
 we see that down at the bottom 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.750
 we have the most used applications 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.210
 as an internet browser 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.390
 youtube a music application a 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.310
 game that brings the play store google 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.530
 At the top left we see a 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.870
 qr code that if we change them with 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.300
 our smartphone will send us to 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.120
 play store where is the application m 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.320
 control that is the application that we are going to 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.720
 install on our phone to 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.550
 control the huawei as if it were a 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.420
 remote control 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.160
 if we see if we go to the explorer now 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.630
 let's see what is very simple 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.940
 example here we have in google the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.730
 search engine is very simple, a 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.080
 very simple keyboard use it this if 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.880
 We are not using our smartphone 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.050
 if we are with the application we can 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.300
 use our keyboard 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.710
 smartphone we will not have problem here 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.180
 we select what we want to look for 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.410
 we can enter any place in 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.630
 internet as if it were a browser 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.300
 from the pc 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.970
 we have the youtube application that 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.020
 It is also very intuitive to use these 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.020
 are the videos that come by default 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.879
 we can use the play store where 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.440
 let's download the applications in this 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.720
 If we do not have an account of 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.889
 Google associated but if I had could 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.979
 download it 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.020
 in the search box to search google 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.659
 direct internet without having to open the 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.430
 explorer good everything very simple very 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.479
 simple very intuitive but at the same time 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.479
 quite complete 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.210
 well friends we hope that our review 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.250
 of the average huawei that has been useful 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.130
 we tell you that in Uruguay the price 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.840
 of the device is 159 dollars what 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.470
 which seems fair given the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.090
 benefits of it 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.470
 We thank whoever does what we 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.470
 they lend the devices for our 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.470
 reviews and we invite you to visit their web
