support<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.130> tub<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.820> 6-inch<00:01:54.329> step<00:01:54.630> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
support the tub on the 6-inch step so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
support the tub on the 6-inch step so
you'll<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> later<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you'll see that later this is the this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
you'll see that later this is the this
is<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> wood<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> foot<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.640> we

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
is the wood for the foot in here but we

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660 
is the wood for the foot in here but we
need<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.350> unfortunately<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.009> piece

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
need to do unfortunately we have a piece

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.069 
need to do unfortunately we have a piece
of<00:02:02.700> plumbing<00:02:03.030> running<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.689> through<00:02:03.719> here

of plumbing running right through here
this<00:02:04.200> is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
this is

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.900 
this is
actually<00:02:04.750> we<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:04.870> saw<00:02:05.320> how<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.040> that

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
actually we just saw how the that

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.550 
actually we just saw how the that
three-way<00:02:07.420> valve<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.960> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> direct<00:02:08.290> ray

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
or directly to the black order to the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.390 
or directly to the black order to the
septic<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.320> pipe<00:02:14.560> for<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
septic this is the pipe for the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.880 
septic this is the pipe for the
Blackwater<00:02:15.880> septic<00:02:16.360> run<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:17.500> we're<00:02:17.710> going<00:02:17.830> to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
Blackwater septic run if we're going to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.940 
Blackwater septic run if we're going to
send<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.160> gray<00:02:18.430> water<00:02:19.470> over<00:02:20.470> into<00:02:20.680> something

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
send that gray water over into something

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.380 
send that gray water over into something
and<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.190> goes<00:02:21.520> straight<00:02:21.670> down<00:02:21.820> here<00:02:22.270> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
and this goes straight down here and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.560 
and this goes straight down here and
ties<00:02:22.600> into<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.170> sewage<00:02:23.950> pipe<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.210> we<00:02:25.330> need<00:02:25.450> to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
ties into that sewage pipe so we need to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.600 
ties into that sewage pipe so we need to
do<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.170> build<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.890> form<00:02:27.190> for<00:02:27.460> this

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
do here is build the form for this

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.760 
do here is build the form for this
around<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.390> pipe<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.320> we<00:02:29.380> need<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.620> protect

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
around this pipe and we need to protect

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.200 
around this pipe and we need to protect
this<00:02:30.100> pipe<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.670> don't<00:02:30.820> want<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.030> pour

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
this pipe because you don't want to pour

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.200 
this pipe because you don't want to pour
concrete<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.810> onto<00:02:32.140> PVC<00:02:33.060> concrete<00:02:34.060> has

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
concrete right onto PVC concrete has

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.750 
concrete right onto PVC concrete has
there's<00:02:34.900> some<00:02:35.310> expansion<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.640> contraction

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
there's some expansion and contraction

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.920 
there's some expansion and contraction
and<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.870> could<00:02:38.050> theoretically<00:02:39.780> crack<00:02:40.780> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
and that could theoretically crack the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.810 
and that could theoretically crack the
pipe<00:02:41.140> if<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> was<00:02:41.620> poured<00:02:41.860> all<00:02:42.010> around<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> so

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
pipe if it was poured all around it so

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.450 
pipe if it was poured all around it so
we<00:02:43.000> did<00:02:43.150> was<00:02:43.300> we<00:02:43.420> took<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.660> three<00:02:43.900> inch<00:02:44.050> PVC<00:02:44.950> pipe

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
we did was we took a three inch PVC pipe

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.030 
we did was we took a three inch PVC pipe
and<00:02:45.730> cut<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.390> one<00:02:47.170> side<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.650> off<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:47.980> we

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
and cut the one side of it off and we

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.480 
and cut the one side of it off and we
can<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.280> snap<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.790> right<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:50.140> pipe

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
can just snap that right over this pipe

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.290 
can just snap that right over this pipe
and<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:53.650> have<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> sleeve<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.640> little<00:02:54.910> piece

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
and we have a sleeve and a little piece

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.730 
and we have a sleeve and a little piece
of<00:02:55.510> three-inch<00:02:55.780> pipe<00:02:55.990> over<00:02:56.320> that<00:02:56.470> part

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
of three-inch pipe over that part

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.810 
of three-inch pipe over that part
because<00:02:57.010> we're<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> have<00:02:57.459> country

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
because we're going to have country

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.410 
because we're going to have country
going<00:02:58.030> all<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.420> way<00:02:58.510> around<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:59.500> area<00:02:59.920> of<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
going all the way around that area of of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.150 
going all the way around that area of of
that<00:03:01.690> pipe<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.560> that's<00:03:02.800> going<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> protect

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
that pipe so that's going to protect

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.120 
that pipe so that's going to protect
that's<00:03:03.610> going<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> isolate<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:05.100> isolate<00:03:06.100> that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
that's going to isolate the isolate that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.880 
that's going to isolate the isolate that
