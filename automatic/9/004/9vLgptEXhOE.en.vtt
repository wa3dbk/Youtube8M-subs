00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.209
 but I welcome you to a new quote at 1 if you are a woman in the 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.210
 today's broadcast 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.970
 would like to introduce such a small from Dec to the Turk Schlett and although there was 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.510
 before that short introduction of the withholding tax 1 with these companies 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.919
 There was little that was done about stability 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.010
 but the special thing is that now the market will be the Google Market 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.290
 is installed on the devices and of course this much on the device 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.720
 has more possibilities 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.140
 When we introduced the unit earlier this year, some said that is 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.059
 a very useful device 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.339
 with interesting features but he what for today is dealing with the zero 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.559
 know for inventors who have no problems in forums so 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.179
 read a bit in terms of purely and just as well as, for example, the brand 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.880
 So there were ways to get all these Google applications running 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.910
 to install on the section now the Google Market is firmly integrated 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.250
 about this firmware and so he does not have the opportunity as well as all 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.870
 applications 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.210
 Of course you also have to run the samples which applications run and 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.950
 which not 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.540
 but percent the whole thing is actually going now with the market everything 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.420
 pretty fluid 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 because this eliminates the need for many applications 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 either via the usb-stick to install or the network 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 and also updates of programs can be done without any problems for the market 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 be recorded 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.909
 and that's one of the class thing so by that it's real now 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.750
 Full device more you can not get out of the device and what 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.490
 I noticed was after this for more going off all the programs 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 also much more stable and much that did not work before that is now synonymous 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.020
 For example, I once again move the current version of Ingrid World to CD 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 Rio variant 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.690
 To show you again that this is now synonymous 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.090
 it does not work the way you might want to where it says here 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.610
 So the game I can play without any problems between drama has the whole thing 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 old bit but that look at us a bit more closely 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 I also update crawl boxes as well 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.780
 and found Hauer HD that there are still men playing 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.080
 just to show the graphics performance a bit or something 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.639
 possible is what is really clean and runs smoothly 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.509
 then I also tried YouTube to update the application 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.739
 that does not work so clean and there is also the installation 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.739
 failed 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.759
 so now let's just start Angry Birds Rio 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.999
 that starts 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.589
 So with the old televisions Dakar became complete hangers there ever 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.199
 nothing is displayed to store is dead 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.099
 The whole thing hangs a bit, is a bit cumbersome animations them 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.829
 is far from clean 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.289
 but it works 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.759
 to eat instead of pressing button 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.759
 com or continue to choose the level 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.309
 everything works fine 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.309
 and you can even play the game if you have to 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.269
 Aabar on the whole moves a bit like in slow motion 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:19.019
 and there's just that he has the graphics capabilities the device is 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.519
 simply completely overwhelmed 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.519
 but it works 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.479
 there 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.349
 No 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.559
 dpa 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.319
 DAPD 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.319
 become 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.169
 Berlin 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.739
 Yes 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.739
 b 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 betting 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:57.079
 Then at Bahia Farm Tower HD this is a game that is not quite as much traffic 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.019
 Performance requires 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.439
 and all in all 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.859
 and that runs clean 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.250
 with the old firmware hailed in places even a bit 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.249
 I really like that pretty much all around 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.389
 the 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.759
 4 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.409
 on 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.409
 because 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.360
 July are 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.729
 4 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.870
 who in the end I looked at the YouTube applications Markus 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.180
 also runs a lot cleaner and did not crash as often as it did 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.469
 has been before 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.709
 So here you can see synonymous has no problems watching the clips without 

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:54.709
 that the device instantly upwind 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.639
 yes that was it to the new firmware image for that means 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.370
 Section under today's broadcast 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.370
 until the next broadcast taz 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.539
 on 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.550
 high 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:31.610
 DAPD 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.189
 I am
