one of the highlighted sports in
repetitive<00:01:07.049> gripping<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.360> did<00:01:09.600> EMG

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
repetitive gripping so we did EMG

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
finger muscles contract in support of
anything<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.290> do<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:17.740> flexion<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.580> whenever

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
anything we do for flexion so whenever

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.480 
anything we do for flexion so whenever
the<00:02:19.000> flexor<00:02:19.450> muscles<00:02:19.840> grip<00:02:20.140> these<00:02:21.040> finger

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
the flexor muscles grip these finger

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.760 
the flexor muscles grip these finger
muscles<00:02:21.910> are<00:02:22.330> contracting<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.260> stabilize

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
muscles are contracting to stabilize

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.860 
muscles are contracting to stabilize
that<00:02:24.010> grip<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.459> then<00:02:24.940> obviously<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.780> will

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that grip and then obviously as we will

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.540 
that grip and then obviously as we will
show<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> second<00:02:26.860> anytime<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.310> finger

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
show you in a second anytime the finger

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.130 
show you in a second anytime the finger
muscles<00:02:27.910> open<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.510> go<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.900> new<00:02:29.140> hole<00:02:31.140> then

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
muscles open to go to a new hole then

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.530 
muscles open to go to a new hole then
they're<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.740> be<00:02:32.800> active<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:33.340> well<00:02:33.540> so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
they're going to be active as well so

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.580 
they're going to be active as well so
now<00:02:34.660> we're<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.959> go<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.320> more<00:02:35.470> up

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
now we're going to go a little more up

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.949 
now we're going to go a little more up
close<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.790> climber<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> little

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
close with the climber to a little

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.610 
close with the climber to a little
segment<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.920> raw<00:02:39.130> EMG<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.150> show<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.170> just

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
segment of the raw EMG and show you just

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.400 
segment of the raw EMG and show you just
how<00:02:42.160> active<00:02:42.610> those<00:02:43.060> finger<00:02:43.450> extensor<00:02:44.050> muscles

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
how active those finger extensor muscles

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.040 
how active those finger extensor muscles
are<00:02:44.940> when<00:02:45.940> they're<00:02:46.150> when<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.510> climber<00:02:46.780> goes

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
are when they're when the climber goes

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.470 
are when they're when the climber goes
into<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> new<00:02:47.680> hold<00:02:48.070> meaning<00:02:48.520> they<00:02:48.730> go<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:48.970> grab

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
into a new hold meaning they go to grab

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.410 
into a new hold meaning they go to grab
on<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.989> new<00:02:50.200> hold<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> see<00:02:52.180> how<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
on to a new hold you can see how the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.500 
on to a new hold you can see how the
finger<00:02:52.930> flex<00:02:53.500> your<00:02:53.680> muscle<00:02:54.040> pattern<00:02:54.700> fires<00:02:55.150> as

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
finger flex your muscle pattern fires as

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.990 
finger flex your muscle pattern fires as
well<00:02:56.470> as<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.920> finger<00:02:57.250> extensor<00:02:57.670> muscle

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
well as the finger extensor muscle

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.990 
well as the finger extensor muscle
pattern<00:02:58.420> firing<00:02:59.020> in<00:02:59.410> support<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.640> finger

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
pattern firing in support of the finger

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.470 
pattern firing in support of the finger
flexion<00:03:01.440> okay<00:03:02.459> then<00:03:03.459> we'll<00:03:03.580> also<00:03:03.820> see<00:03:04.180> when

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
flexion okay then we'll also see when

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.500 
flexion okay then we'll also see when
the<00:03:04.630> climber<00:03:05.489> goes<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:07.830> opens<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:09.010> grasp<00:03:09.510> that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
the climber goes to opens to grasp that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.180 
the climber goes to opens to grasp that
the<00:03:10.660> finger<00:03:11.020> extensor<00:03:11.410> muscles<00:03:11.709> now<00:03:11.830> become

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
the finger extensor muscles now become

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.699 
the finger extensor muscles now become
more<00:03:12.430> dominant<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.720> comparative<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
more dominant in comparative to the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.580 
more dominant in comparative to the
finger<00:03:15.100> flexor<00:03:15.640> muscles<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:17.350> really

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
finger flexor muscles so just really

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.759 
finger flexor muscles so just really
interesting<00:03:18.299> pattern<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.780> now<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:20.650> can

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
interesting pattern and now that we can

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.810 
interesting pattern and now that we can
see<00:03:20.980> EMG<00:03:21.750> patterns<00:03:22.750> for<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.140> climber<00:03:23.820> it

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
see EMG patterns for the climber it

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.340 
see EMG patterns for the climber it
becomes<00:03:25.120> very<00:03:25.360> obvious<00:03:25.450> where<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.049> climber

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
becomes very obvious where the climber

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.770 
becomes very obvious where the climber
has<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.799> strengthen<00:03:27.519> both<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.209> flexor

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
has to strengthen both the flexor

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.990 
has to strengthen both the flexor
muscles<00:03:29.170> at<00:03:29.260> close<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.709> head<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
muscles at close the head and the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.390 
muscles at close the head and the
extensor<00:03:31.660> muscles<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.560> open<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.190> spread

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
extensor muscles that open and spread

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.310 
extensor muscles that open and spread
the<00:03:33.610> fingers<00:03:34.060> these<00:03:34.360> are<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.660> stabilizer

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
the fingers these are the stabilizer

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.520 
the fingers these are the stabilizer
muscles<00:03:35.500> they're<00:03:36.459> very<00:03:36.820> important<00:03:37.420> if<00:03:38.019> these

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
muscles they're very important if these

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.890 
muscles they're very important if these
are<00:03:38.799> not<00:03:38.980> trained<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.850> tendency<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.390> for<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
are not trained the tendency is for the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.600 
are not trained the tendency is for the
climber<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.650> get<00:03:41.769> very<00:03:41.980> shortened<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.549> the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
climber to get very shortened and the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.300 
climber to get very shortened and the
