00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
technologies that is very unique I have

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
technologies that is very unique I have
a<00:01:05.790> running<00:01:06.360> watch<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.020> running<00:01:07.290> watch<00:01:07.409> out

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
a running watch and my running watch out

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
a running watch and my running watch out
of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> clamp<00:01:08.040> lead<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.540> don't

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
of the clamp lead on it so if I don't

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
of the clamp lead on it so if I don't
link<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.140> exactly<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:11.850> not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
link it up exactly right then I'm not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.380 
link it up exactly right then I'm not
charging<00:01:13.790> additionally<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.030> does<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
charging additionally what this does is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.179 
charging additionally what this does is
it<00:01:15.420> communicates<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:17.040> Android<00:01:19.189> so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it communicates with your Android so

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.580 
it communicates with your Android so
anything<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.390> Android<00:01:21.810> app<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.470> can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
anything that is an Android app that can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340 
anything that is an Android app that can
push<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.549> push<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:23.970> SmartWatch<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.200> an

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
push can push to the SmartWatch so as an

push can push to the SmartWatch so as an
example<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.009> free<00:01:26.280> loaded<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.530> a

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
example what we free loaded on here is a

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
example what we free loaded on here is a
stock<00:01:31.049> ticker<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.729> coming<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:33.060> the
