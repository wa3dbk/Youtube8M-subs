00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
you can stay seven minutes that is

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.920 
you can stay seven minutes that is
really<00:04:59.960> taking<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.470> ends<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:00.950> far<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:02.570> you

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
really taking the ends so far so you

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.300 
really taking the ends so far so you
probably<00:05:03.110> won't<00:05:03.320> even<00:05:03.440> eat<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:03.920> that<00:05:04.100> much
