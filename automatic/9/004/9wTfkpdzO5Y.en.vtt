the issue started to materialize after
about<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:17.949> week<00:00:18.039> I<00:00:18.520> was<00:00:18.850> in<00:00:19.000> here<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.360> started

I had several contractors in and we

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.950 
I had several contractors in and we
realized<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:37.870> had<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.170> major<00:00:38.739> structural<00:00:39.160> issue

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
realized we had a major structural issue

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280 
realized we had a major structural issue
the<00:00:40.960> main<00:00:41.140> beam<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.680> our<00:00:41.770> home<00:00:42.010> was<00:00:43.290> not

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
the main beam to our home was not

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.410 
the main beam to our home was not
structural<00:00:44.920> supportive<00:00:45.489> enough<00:00:45.760> a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
structural supportive enough a

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.270 
structural supportive enough a
load-bearing<00:00:46.899> wall<00:00:47.079> had<00:00:47.590> at<00:00:47.739> some<00:00:47.890> point<00:00:47.950> been

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
load-bearing wall had at some point been

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.360 
load-bearing wall had at some point been
removed<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.500> current<00:00:50.739> beam<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.219> was

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
removed and so the current beam that was

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.250 
removed and so the current beam that was
in<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.640> home<00:00:51.789> was<00:00:52.000> not<00:00:52.149> structurally<00:00:52.989> strong

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
in the home was not structurally strong

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.770 
in the home was not structurally strong
enough<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.649> hold<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:53.890> roof<00:00:54.160> of<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.700> home<00:00:54.879> then

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
enough to hold the roof of the home then

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.750 
enough to hold the roof of the home then
we<00:00:55.930> realized<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.860> basement<00:00:57.039> was<00:00:57.399> full

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
we realized that the basement was full

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
we realized that the basement was full
of<00:00:57.820> mold<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.739> we<00:01:00.160> started<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.760> locate<00:01:01.510> mold

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
of mold and as we started to locate mold

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.829 
of mold and as we started to locate mold
it<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.410> kept<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.219> point<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.629> home

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
it just kept to the point that the home

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.230 
it just kept to the point that the home
has<00:01:05.139> basic<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.799> had<00:01:06.039> to<00:01:06.189> at<00:01:06.310> one<00:01:06.490> point<00:01:06.670> pretty

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
has basic we had to at one point pretty

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.529 
has basic we had to at one point pretty
much<00:01:07.420> cut<00:01:07.719> the<00:01:07.899> home<00:01:08.520> finding<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.759> things

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
much cut the home finding that things

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.300 
much cut the home finding that things
were<00:01:11.200> not<00:01:11.380> done<00:01:11.679> to<00:01:11.950> code<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:14.740> portrayed<00:01:15.159> to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.709 
were not done to code was portrayed to
us<00:01:15.459> that<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.789> work<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:15.999> was<00:01:16.329> done<00:01:16.359> in<00:01:16.539> the

us that the work that was done in the
home<00:01:16.899> was<00:01:17.139> done<00:01:17.349> by<00:01:17.590> licensed<00:01:18.249> contractors

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
home was done by licensed contractors

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.910 
home was done by licensed contractors
and<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.270> all<00:01:19.420> city<00:01:19.749> codes<00:01:20.079> had<00:01:20.380> been<00:01:22.409> met<00:01:23.409> -

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
and that all city codes had been met -

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.010 
and that all city codes had been met -
on<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.729> remodel<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.270> was<00:01:25.539> done<00:01:25.719> to<00:01:25.899> this

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
on the remodel that was done to this

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.249 
on the remodel that was done to this
home<00:01:26.459> but<00:01:27.459> in<00:01:27.700> retrospect<00:01:28.450> we<00:01:28.840> found<00:01:29.079> out

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
home but in retrospect we found out

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.469 
home but in retrospect we found out
that's<00:01:29.380> not<00:01:29.529> correct<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.609> was<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.149> was<00:01:31.209> an

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
that's not correct so it was it was an

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.319 
that's not correct so it was it was an
ongoing<00:01:31.659> process<00:01:32.139> from<00:01:32.649> a<00:01:32.950> few<00:01:33.759> days<00:01:33.969> after

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
ongoing process from a few days after

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.679 
ongoing process from a few days after
purchasing<00:01:34.779> the<00:01:34.869> home<00:01:35.139> -<00:01:35.889> up<00:01:36.310> actually<00:01:37.240> we've
