00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.639
 I want to show what crop currants have 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.880
 us this year at buck yard 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.030
 I show that we have several bushes 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 this year a lot of currants 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:23.090
 red and black then show that we are from 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.090
 we will do it 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 oh it started to rain 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.890
 raspberry starts to ripen from 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:58.840
 here is the crop that we took now we 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:04.120
 let's weigh it here I got 500 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:07.230
 gram now another little box 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.230
 a little less than 500 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.560
 here is red with black currant 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.479
 also 500 grams a little more in total 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.450
 the complexity of a kilogram of berries is obtained 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.240
 Now we will grind sugar from 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.469
 calculating kilogram i berries and kilogram 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.469
 kilogram of 200 sugar 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:34.080
 I think its under running water and then 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.080
 long follow 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.920
 Now we are shifting this berry to 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.920
 food processor 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.280
 and fall asleep with sugar 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.400
 our berry is ready turned out very 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.140
 tasty and it is very useful 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.610
 now only left and pour 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.610
 jars and refrigerate 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.910
