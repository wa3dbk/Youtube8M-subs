00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
the other buttons because those are the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.550 
the other buttons because those are the
grounds<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.510> want<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> follow<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.140> ones<00:02:32.320> all

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
grounds you want to follow the ones all

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.330 
grounds you want to follow the ones all
the<00:02:32.680> way<00:02:32.770> back<00:02:33.330> they'll<00:02:34.330> get<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.720> about<00:02:35.340> right

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the way back they'll get to about right

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.370 
the way back they'll get to about right
around<00:02:36.490> here<00:02:38.160> okay<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.630> back<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
around here okay then on the back of the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.000 
around here okay then on the back of the
controller<00:02:43.320> you're<00:02:44.320> gonna<00:02:44.440> want<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.800> find

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
controller you're gonna want to find

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.070 
controller you're gonna want to find
where<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.400> pass<00:02:45.640> through<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.600> these<00:02:46.930> little

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
where they pass through on these little

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.280 
where they pass through on these little
buttons<00:02:47.320> or<00:02:47.950> little<00:02:48.430> holes<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.960> then<00:02:50.080> they'll

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
buttons or little holes and then they'll

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.350 
buttons or little holes and then they'll
eventually<00:02:50.670> they'll<00:02:51.670> pass<00:02:51.910> through<00:02:52.210> those

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
eventually they'll pass through those

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.230 
eventually they'll pass through those
holes<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.220> they'll<00:02:54.220> go<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.460> a<00:02:54.610> short<00:02:54.940> little

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
holes and they'll go to a short little

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.520 
holes and they'll go to a short little
trace<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:55.900> they'll<00:02:56.080> go<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.260> these

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
trace and then they'll go to these

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.180 
trace and then they'll go to these

little tiny solder points see I already

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.090 
little tiny solder points see I already
have<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.610> marked<00:03:00.910> out<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.710> x1<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.660> Y

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
have the marked out is the x1 the Y

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.700 
have the marked out is the x1 the Y
obviously<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.610> already<00:03:06.790> been<00:03:07.030> soldered

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
obviously a is already been soldered

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.970 
obviously a is already been soldered
and<00:03:08.710> so<00:03:08.920> has<00:03:09.100> B<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.260> four<00:03:11.680> or<00:03:11.800> five

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and so has B there's like four or five

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.860 
and so has B there's like four or five
different<00:03:12.220> versions<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:13.240> these<00:03:13.450> circuit

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
different versions of these circuit

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.590 
different versions of these circuit
boards<00:03:14.200> for<00:03:14.290> these<00:03:14.650> X<00:03:14.890> boxes<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.640> you're<00:03:16.510> gonna

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
boards for these X boxes so you're gonna

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.960 
boards for these X boxes so you're gonna
have<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> look<00:03:17.020> up<00:03:17.230> up<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.160> traces<00:03:18.580> online

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
have to look up up the the traces online

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.840 
have to look up up the the traces online
you<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.360> find<00:03:19.600> them<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.870> Xbox<00:03:20.380> forums<00:03:20.890> or<00:03:21.610> you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
you can find them on Xbox forums or you

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.100 
you can find them on Xbox forums or you
can<00:03:22.060> trace<00:03:22.240> them<00:03:22.420> back<00:03:22.450> it's<00:03:22.810> not<00:03:22.900> that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
can trace them back it's not that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.710 
can trace them back it's not that
difficult<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.430> when<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:24.910> come<00:03:25.150> back<00:03:25.330> I'll<00:03:25.660> show

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
difficult so when I come back I'll show
