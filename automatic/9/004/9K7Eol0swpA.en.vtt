them<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.170> their<00:01:09.290> friends<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.549> just<00:01:10.759> won't

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
them to their friends you you just won't

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
go back after using one so this is the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.300 
go back after using one so this is the
RS<00:01:14.180> sport<00:01:14.570> number<00:01:14.840> 2<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:15.880> smaller<00:01:16.880> skinnier

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
RS sport number 2 it's smaller skinnier

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.850 
RS sport number 2 it's smaller skinnier
noticeably<00:01:19.310> skinnier<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:21.320> know<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.439> think<00:01:21.590> it

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
noticeably skinnier you know I think it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.160 
noticeably skinnier you know I think it
may<00:01:22.009> be<00:01:22.039> slightly<00:01:22.549> denser<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.420> thicker<00:01:23.539> than

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
may be slightly denser and thicker than

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.990 
may be slightly denser and thicker than
the<00:01:24.380> original<00:01:24.829> sport<00:01:25.189> but<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:25.820> definitely

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
the original sport but it's definitely

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.529 
the original sport but it's definitely
skinnier<00:01:26.719> here<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.409> original<00:01:27.500> actually

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
skinnier here is the original actually

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.690 
skinnier here is the original actually
here's<00:01:29.539> one<00:01:29.780> they<00:01:29.990> prepared<00:01:30.409> earlier<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.609> you

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
here's one they prepared earlier so you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.080 
here's one they prepared earlier so you
can<00:01:31.880> see<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.390> number<00:01:33.170> two<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.789> ever<00:01:34.789> so

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
can see the number two is ever so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.539 
can see the number two is ever so
slightly<00:01:35.359> shorter<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.649> significantly

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
slightly shorter but significantly

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.649 
slightly shorter but significantly
thinner<00:01:38.000> then<00:01:38.509> this<00:01:39.109> is<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.439> original

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
thinner then this is the original

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.270 
thinner then this is the original
otherwise<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.990> buckles<00:01:42.380> all<00:01:42.590> seem<00:01:42.920> exactly

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
otherwise the buckles all seem exactly

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.980 
otherwise the buckles all seem exactly
the<00:01:43.579> same<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:44.420> as<00:01:44.600> strong<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:46.659> not<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.719> hell

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the same just as strong and not a hell

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.419 
the same just as strong and not a hell
of<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.140> lot<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.320> difference<00:01:48.710> between<00:01:48.799> them<00:01:49.280> to

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
of a lot of difference between them to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.120 
of a lot of difference between them to
be<00:01:49.520> honest<00:01:50.140> some<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> these<00:01:51.350> come<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.890> bags

just how simple these are to set up

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.610 
just how simple these are to set up
seriously<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.840> you're<00:02:31.990> not<00:02:32.140> using<00:02:32.350> one<00:02:32.500> of

seriously if you're not using one of

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.200 
seriously if you're not using one of
these<00:02:32.800> get<00:02:33.100> one<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.400> takes<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:33.880> weight

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
these get one it takes all the weight

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.180 
these get one it takes all the weight
off<00:02:34.450> your<00:02:34.660> neck<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> best

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
off your neck and it's just the best

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.400 
off your neck and it's just the best
thing<00:02:36.310> ever<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.240> I've<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.570> screwed<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.230> on

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
thing ever so I've just screwed that on

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.050 
thing ever so I've just screwed that on
to<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.680> bottom<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.220> camera<00:02:39.430> nice<00:02:39.790> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to the bottom of the camera nice and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.360 
to the bottom of the camera nice and
tight<00:02:40.270> it's<00:02:40.990> all<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.620> well<00:02:41.770> built<00:02:41.980> steel

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
tight it's all really well built steel

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.160 
tight it's all really well built steel
so<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:43.000> kind<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.300> use<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.630> buckle<00:02:43.990> as<00:02:44.140> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
so I just kind of use the buckle as a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.320 
so I just kind of use the buckle as a
lever<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.680> tighten<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.490> up<00:02:45.550> nice<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:45.880> tight

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
lever to tighten that up nice and tight

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.260 
lever to tighten that up nice and tight
and<00:02:46.510> then<00:02:46.570> looking<00:02:47.500> at<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.709> one<00:02:48.270> generally

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
and then looking at this one generally

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.900 
and then looking at this one generally
they<00:02:49.420> come<00:02:49.450> packed<00:02:50.200> nice<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.980> small<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.550> I'm

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
they come packed nice and small so I'm

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.670 
they come packed nice and small so I'm
going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.150> extend<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.810> all<00:02:52.959> out<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> little<00:02:53.410> bit

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
going to extend it all out a little bit

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.610 
going to extend it all out a little bit
so<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.250> fits<00:02:54.520> around<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:55.080> more<00:02:56.080> generous

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
so that it fits around my more generous

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.020 
so that it fits around my more generous
frame<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:58.810> each<00:02:59.230> axis<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.220> all<00:03:00.400> adjustable

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
frame on each axis it's all adjustable

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.170 
frame on each axis it's all adjustable
but<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.660> sport<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.260> get<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.760> pointy<00:03:04.150> bit

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
but the sport you get the the pointy bit

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.710 
but the sport you get the the pointy bit
pointing<00:03:04.780> towards<00:03:05.590> your<00:03:05.830> left<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.610> then<00:03:07.270> just

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
pointing towards your left and then just

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.600 
pointing towards your left and then just
pop<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.110> over<00:03:08.290> put<00:03:08.800> your<00:03:08.920> right<00:03:09.160> arm<00:03:09.400> through

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
pop it over put your right arm through

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.449 
pop it over put your right arm through
over<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:10.720> head<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.140> then<00:03:11.830> just<00:03:12.070> sit<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.370> on

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
over your head and then just sit it on

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.460 
over your head and then just sit it on
your<00:03:12.670> shoulder<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:14.020> sits<00:03:14.200> there<00:03:14.320> like

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
your shoulder so it just sits there like

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.680 
your shoulder so it just sits there like
that<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.520> haven't<00:03:15.880> made<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.209> long<00:03:16.450> enough

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
that and I haven't made this long enough

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.979 
that and I haven't made this long enough
for<00:03:16.840> myself<00:03:17.260> just<00:03:17.440> yet<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:18.310> still<00:03:19.030> comically

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.170 
for myself just yet it's still comically
short<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.500> let's<00:03:20.530> just<00:03:20.950> take<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.310> off<00:03:21.370> as<00:03:21.730> I

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.390 
short so let's just take that off as I
said<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.600> all<00:03:22.780> exactly<00:03:23.650> as<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.220> came

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
said this is all exactly as it just came

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.120 
said this is all exactly as it just came
straight<00:03:24.610> out<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.120> box<00:03:25.680> okay<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.739> that's<00:03:27.040> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
straight out of the box okay so that's a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.220 
straight out of the box okay so that's a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
though it's skinnier it um it feels just

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.720

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.009 
huge lens on this one at the moment but
it<00:04:03.340> does<00:04:03.519> feel<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:03.850> it's<00:04:04.150> going<00:04:04.330> across<00:04:04.690> the

you just lock the back one there and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.529 
you just lock the back one there and
then<00:04:30.250> when<00:04:30.370> you're<00:04:30.490> not<00:04:30.639> using<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.300> slide

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
clip as well and then you can see the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.890 
clip as well and then you can see the
cameras<00:04:36.460> between<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:36.940> two<00:04:37.090> clips<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.720> it's

great<00:05:31.740> now<00:05:32.740> comparing<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.729> blackrapid

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
great now comparing the blackrapid

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.670 
great now comparing the blackrapid
sport<00:05:35.500> one<00:05:35.860> versus<00:05:36.490> two<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:37.110> absolutely<00:05:38.110> loved

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
sport one versus two I absolutely loved

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.680 
sport one versus two I absolutely loved
my<00:05:38.979> one<00:05:39.220> if<00:05:39.460> you've<00:05:39.639> already<00:05:39.789> got<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.210> one<00:05:40.419> I

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
my one if you've already got the one I

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.779 
my one if you've already got the one I
would<00:05:41.050> say<00:05:41.289> you<00:05:41.830> probably<00:05:41.860> don't<00:05:42.310> need<00:05:42.460> to

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
would say you probably don't need to

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.520 
would say you probably don't need to
upgrade<00:05:43.120> there's<00:05:43.750> not<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.110> much<00:05:44.289> of<00:05:44.470> a

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
upgrade there's not that much of a

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.529 
upgrade there's not that much of a
difference<00:05:44.830> between<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.220> two<00:05:45.550> if<00:05:45.729> you're

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
difference between the two if you're

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.189 
difference between the two if you're
just<00:05:46.930> getting<00:05:47.110> one<00:05:47.380> for<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.650> first<00:05:47.860> time<00:05:48.190> then

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
just getting one for the first time then

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.870 
just getting one for the first time then
generally<00:05:50.199> the<00:05:50.229> shops<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:50.860> know<00:05:51.010> maybe<00:05:51.669> you

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
generally the shops you know maybe you

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.939 
generally the shops you know maybe you
can<00:05:52.030> try<00:05:52.240> it<00:05:52.300> out<00:05:52.449> in<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.870> shop<00:05:53.080> if<00:05:53.260> you're

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
can try it out in the shop if you're

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.390 
can try it out in the shop if you're
slimmer<00:05:54.940> than<00:05:55.150> me<00:05:55.300> then<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.949> sport<00:05:56.949> too<00:05:57.159> may<00:05:57.340> be

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
slimmer than me then a sport too may be

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.899 
slimmer than me then a sport too may be
better<00:05:57.699> for<00:05:57.820> you<00:05:59.159> but<00:06:00.159> they're<00:06:00.310> both<00:06:00.460> just<00:06:00.520> as

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
better for you but they're both just as

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.100 
better for you but they're both just as
comfortable<00:06:01.360> as<00:06:01.509> each<00:06:01.690> other

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
comfortable as each other

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.409 
comfortable as each other
I<00:06:02.289> guess<00:06:02.770> you<00:06:03.159> know<00:06:03.280> smaller<00:06:03.639> is<00:06:03.820> easy<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.210> pack

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
I guess you know smaller is easy to pack

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.790 
I guess you know smaller is easy to pack
and<00:06:04.630> all<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:04.990> sort<00:06:05.199> of<00:06:05.259> thing<00:06:05.440> for<00:06:05.650> you<00:06:05.770> so

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
and all of that sort of thing for you so

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.980 
and all of that sort of thing for you so
that<00:06:06.070> might<00:06:06.250> be<00:06:06.400> worth<00:06:06.580> getting<00:06:06.820> but<00:06:07.419> they're

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
that might be worth getting but they're

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.610 
that might be worth getting but they're
both<00:06:08.139> fantastic<00:06:08.380> I'll<00:06:09.070> still<00:06:09.669> be<00:06:09.789> using<00:06:10.210> my<00:06:10.620> my

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
original sport as well I'll probably

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.600 
original sport as well I'll probably
keep<00:06:13.990> one<00:06:14.229> of<00:06:14.259> them<00:06:14.440> on<00:06:14.560> my<00:06:14.680> d4<00:06:15.159> and<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.460> other
