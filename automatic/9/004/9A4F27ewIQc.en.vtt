00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
thing is so sharp it's it just slices

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249 
thing is so sharp it's it just slices
your<00:01:56.700> paper<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.659> sharp<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.140> has

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
your paper this is not as sharp this has

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
your paper this is not as sharp this has
made<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.530> AusAID<00:01:58.890> steel<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.430> why<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
made of AusAID steel that's why so it's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
made of AusAID steel that's why so it's
a<00:02:00.240> medium<00:02:00.540> grade<00:02:00.719> steel<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.100> right

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a medium grade steel you can see right

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.830 
a medium grade steel you can see right
there<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:03.509> says<00:02:03.630> hace<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:06.509> made<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
there it says hace and it's made of a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.839 
there it says hace and it's made of a
medium<00:02:07.170> grade<00:02:07.409> steel<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.979> sharpens<00:02:08.250> real

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
medium grade steel so it sharpens real

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.360 
medium grade steel so it sharpens real
up<00:02:09.090> real<00:02:09.360> good<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> dulls<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
up real good and it but it dulls a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.370 
up real good and it but it dulls a

really<00:02:27.940> complaining<00:02:28.300> about<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> an

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
really complaining about it this is an

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.650 
really complaining about it this is an
EDC<00:02:30.010> knife<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.580> tactical<00:02:31.000> knife<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.630> I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
EDC knife not a tactical knife but I

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.010 
EDC knife not a tactical knife but I
would<00:02:31.930> use<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.319> sure<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:33.819> guess<00:02:34.780> as<00:02:34.989> a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
would use this for sure I guess as a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.559 
would use this for sure I guess as a
backup<00:02:35.260> knife<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.910> people<00:02:37.120> would<00:02:37.209> say<00:02:37.390> no

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
backup knife some people would say no

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.360 
backup knife some people would say no
because<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.020> doesn't<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.760> any<00:02:39.760> way<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> open

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
because it doesn't have any way to open

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.030 
because it doesn't have any way to open
without<00:02:42.370> using<00:02:42.670> more<00:02:43.120> than<00:02:43.300> one<00:02:43.420> finger<00:02:44.040> it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
without using more than one finger it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.830 
without using more than one finger it's
really<00:02:45.340> stiff<00:02:45.610> there's<00:02:45.880> no<00:02:46.030> blade<00:02:46.360> play<00:02:46.630> in

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
really stiff there's no blade play in

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.030 
really stiff there's no blade play in
there<00:02:47.340> no<00:02:48.340> blade<00:02:48.640> play<00:02:49.350> even<00:02:50.350> while<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.800> there

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
there no blade play even while in there

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.030 
there no blade play even while in there
it's<00:02:51.370> very<00:02:51.459> little<00:02:51.850> but<00:02:52.200> when<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.350> extend<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it's very little but when you extend the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.320 
it's very little but when you extend the
blade<00:02:54.250> there's<00:02:54.489> like<00:02:54.640> no<00:02:54.790> blade<00:02:55.000> play<00:02:55.150> but

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
blade there's like no blade play but

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.300 
blade there's like no blade play but
yeah<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.540> has<00:02:55.660> these<00:02:55.810> three<00:02:56.050> little<00:02:56.410> holes

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
yeah it has these three little holes

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.390 
yeah it has these three little holes
here<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.080> guess<00:02:59.080> if<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.350> really<00:02:59.380> wanted<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.130> put

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
knife lanyard through the hole it would

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.629 
knife lanyard through the hole it would
probably<00:04:52.659> fit<00:04:52.990> better<00:04:53.199> but<00:04:53.440> but<00:04:54.310> yeah<00:04:54.430> this

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639
