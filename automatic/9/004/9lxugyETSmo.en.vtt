00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.180
 more 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.999
 so dear people, I welcome you again cordially to another fire 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.029
 Land on 25 Red Kite from a Motion 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.420
 and that's about it as it is now with Lord on in two phases 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.400
 divided 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.880
 The fight begins as soon as you enter the platform in front 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.849
 then casually row will allegedly not start to run aground 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.150
 he is not separated in this phase but 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.570
 we pass the taxes 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.840
 Damage occurs on the right foot or left foot 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.310
 that of course decides depending on 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.210
 respectively 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.460
 where the volcanoes are made 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.630
 because over these volcanoes it resides right in the picture 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.900
 we must 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.910
 because where row OLEDs pull 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.860
 that means we have to turn a right turn now that means we do 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.920
 just a pity on the right foot 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 so far about Zotti 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.690
 Therefore, the rotation of sand with me trading cards to oversteer make 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 then again on the left foot 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.190
 and parables right over again 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.670
 first run at the moment and then over again right 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.049
 and yes why all around Lord Weidenfeld an option Tian armor 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 which nominates our states and 80 percent 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.310
 and every time he was hit by an active volcano 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.770
 The performance is reduced by ten percent 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.240
 and yes, therefore, should be clear what to do 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.430
 the boss is also a lot of fun, they also found a new one 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.110
 Perm professional module 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.910
 this just shows us in which direction the foot trader is facing 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.830
 emotional 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.100
 we are now more to the right 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 otherwise nature should not pay attention that Pum is not the lord 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.690
 called his platform touched here 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.610
 otherwise he uses the ability to drink Mattmann 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.560
 and then just cause damage to the RexP around which is not necessary 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.760
 otherwise you will just see the fire on the ground and around it 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.649
 arise explosion 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.579
 or just the fire on the ground that goes 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.579
 from the ability of these craters 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.479
 he has no real time or anything like that 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:24.629
 but renewed so percent he simply creates should also vent 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.449
 from the crater 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.869
 and of course you have to take care you see the same as the one again 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.419
 again which arise 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:35.359
 Otherwise, of course, be careful that staggering stomping 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.859
 and Bayern now come to the cast to the cashier of course have the job 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.909
 the little sparks and fragments you see on the right side of the picture 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.699
 firmly a radio operator 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.899
 to kill and here is the addressed 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.569
 to the mentioned I say 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.629
 Crater eruption of initial signs, of course, only 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.899
 But to come back to the chestnuts 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.539
 even if it was tight and the Cast have as said the task the 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.099
 To kill sparks and fragments 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.649
 being around 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.379
 the sparks are so bad 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.769
 since they are all players within a radius of ten meters or 12 13 meters 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.619
 depending on 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.329
 to cause ten thousand fire damage 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.200
 Hamdy Fricke 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.669
 to give up the fragments 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.199
 would ideally have to be killed within 30 seconds 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.689
 otherwise they will simply pick a player from your world 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.309
 and save on damage 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.379
 Percent of remaining health from the place to lead 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.509
 It is said that the market has no idea about 300,000 life points 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:41.519
 He picks out your Haider x and then causes these 300000 points 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.889
 the damage could be on the plan 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.009
 on selected Haider only as an example 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.309
 that's why the sparks excuses the fragments excusively 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.279
 and yes as miniatures as I said the task 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.279
 the place to taxes depending on the right foot so that he already turns 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.149
 right 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.449
 Leighton foot warmer CeBIT he is still with should be clear 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.519
 and always nice over the volcanoes 10 then that fits too 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.430
 and yes important to pay attention to these craters outbreaks on the ground 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.169
 of course that's all harm you do pretty well 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.479
 Avoid Real Estate HRE 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.489
 and yes, by and large, that was basically the first phase around 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.489
 Phase transition starts at 25 percent 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.539
 who his feet 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.960
 then the obsidian armor that is just protecting him collapses 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.300
 and fighting for against molten 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.159
 melted Norbert melted I can also molten colossus I say 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.529
 just now 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.550
 on or a naked 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.819
 Unnerstall Nordwalde 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.319
 if you like 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.569
 and yes here again the nice turn or must first 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.789
 straight ahead of WADA 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.580
 Another volcano is believed to be quite hard to recognize but he is in front of him 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.599
 Another active volcano is a Las Vegas the Trader leaked 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.770
 and then make Max the hate for the right foot as sure right here 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.719
 image 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.120
 again a volcano is located 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.919
 then also around 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.449
 yes again ten percent obsidian armor of thinking undertakes 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.689
 and then 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.360
 you should collapse right there you see the right foot has 28% 27 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.839
 the left foot too and 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.499
 yes, now it's going straight back to two active volcano together 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:25.919
 take care that you stand on it "never was there never fell 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.999
 and now every phase transition in phase 2 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.490
 you see how he transforms now he has transformed himself here 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.749
 He still has 25% HP 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.990
 11 Komar 6 million in 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.460
 25 player mode and now it just really means 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.699
 in youth go stomping stomping stomping stomping 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.819
 or not enough simply to fall away 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.779
 and of course here the crater outbreaks 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.180
 He has avoided being affected otherwise 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.350
 the boss is very easy he makes a lot of fun that just something 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.469
 new is 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.259
 with the feet 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.259
 vote 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.949
 yes you see Bastrop very quickly as I said not like Dance Points 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.189
 Next to ten halls then that fits 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.659
 and yes I thank you at this point neither provider as always with mine 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.809
 Gelderns is bleeding from July Unterberger 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.309
 ambition has helped or even helps you 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.869
 and yes all my used add-ons you can find on my website 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:25.650
 Veoh Republican Motion Pompeii 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.520
 Just pick up in the navigation Leo Baal and then 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.699
 I already have the direct link to the article 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.649
 and he does that well by then Kauter reengcken going on Schaub
