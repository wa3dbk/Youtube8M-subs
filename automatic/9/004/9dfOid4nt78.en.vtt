00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.269
 welcome a new video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.010
 here we are from westeros attacked this 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.420
 Restless and electric object of even 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.799
 several of the two vehicles that have 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.780
 taken out in this new DLD the robberies to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.310
 banks, I do not have a subscriber that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.510
 he is very nice and he has left me the cars 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.100
 when jazzaldÃ­a buys on his own 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.420
 and said is because it leaves me the cars that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.529
 I have little money and he taught them in a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.539
 video in fact is therefore perfect not 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.590
 then he has taken the cars 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 that he had already bought them he has taken them out 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.619
 of faces and I will leave them one by one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.310
 towards nothing, many times a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.390
 subscribers 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.949
 and nothing we can start with the first 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 car and then he's gotten into this 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.980
 new dlc bank robberies and stick and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.600
 I love 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 I made a tank and said it's a damn 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.680
 tanks and if I call the car lord 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.660
 off-road gas tank 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.879
 besides curry pretty now that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 checking and what gives a touch without 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 original plan are the pipes of the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.829
 sides that you know I've never seen 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.940
 no car and it is very cool and for 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.710
 true the price 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 At the end we look at all the prices because 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
 if we stop to look at the price of each 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 car words that is pretty accurate what 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.239
 that we're going to do it something a long time 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.129
 case here as I say is a damn 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.049
 see here and it 's one of the few 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.190
 cars that have the wheels are so 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.620
 high body 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.810
 of the height of the wheel until you know 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.150
 it's quite high it 's a sturdy car 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.040
 high is a tank and I really have 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.020
 said is a damn nice tank the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.580
 true as you are seeing it is very cool 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.590
 the truth so let's try the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.330
 next is that in this video teach 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.190
 the bikes design or think that it is almost 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.570
 all those who have gotten and then more 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.710
 go ahead because good the cars and the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.760
 vehicles are already unlocking as 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.530
 you go from bank robberies 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.790
 and the whole thing in case you do not know it like that 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.990
 nothing could leave the car for annie 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.850
 the subscriber has a hard time climbing 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.350
 the ramp really but good in the case 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 that it has has enough power going to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.840
 be a ballistic SUV that we are 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.310
 here back as you are saying that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.170
 this case is bengasi in the van that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.370
 is not that I have much plan that 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.960
 Bera Bera running like a van 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.910
 normal motor sleep is pretty 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.500
 same and I think that this function already 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.760
 I was in the game I think if I do not remember 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.190
 bad what happens is that it was some but 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.110
 that is not the taillights not what 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.670
 I remember very well but good the case 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 is that you smell it exercise actions 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.030
 fix them to the crystals back like that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.470
 does not have them very tinted and that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.390
 Disastrous decision as quite elegant 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.580
 very flat as well as the firmness that they carry 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.630
 the celebrities at the weird events and the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.820
 wta that many ball so here the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.260
 you have the truth that if enough was left 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.610
 Well, we're going from seven identical vehicles 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.989
 Then next link is the bike as 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.100
 you are seeing state to vote that have 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.750
 stuck in the new 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.730
 to see if she is beautiful all of you escape to 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.460
 the sides there is an aesthetic 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.490
 the engine will see that it is also 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.490
 pretty cool and as you can see, he 's in 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.450
 the front side the front light is 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.860
 somewhat as well as a little weirder is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.670
 a little more in the trailer as if it were 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.550
 very small but good here the part 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.160
 back that as I say it does not escape that 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.600
 the sides is beautiful and the bike 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.340
 It's cool in general if you look if it's 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.890
 as well as very simple not what to say 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.330
 very cumbersome is simple and you are 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.470
 as well as it also lifts off the ground 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.060
 just like the vehicle first that you 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.340
 has taught and I sincerely like it 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.170
 pretty much so let's go with the 7 and here 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.660
 we have the following vehicle that mother 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.150
 mine is handsome evolutionary is a car 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.220
 classic as well in sports plan that already 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.560
 I taught just yesterday and the truth is 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.940
 I love it, I love it very much 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.830
 much the front light are like this 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.130
 looks as well as very bright and I 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.130
 love 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.750
 today and the part is very cool 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.440
 that reminds me of a picture of ones 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.770
 costs that teach 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.770
 my father told small memories 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.470
 the joints of the crystals have earthquakes 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.330
 Silver-plated with a silver color 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.100
 better said and I also love design 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.660
 of the engine as well as joint feel like 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.100
 of harley davidson but in car version 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.630
 as he would say kid peeing with the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.010
 flare gun look what I say 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.230
 so that we guys are here the karim 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.210
 kuruma that when he changes gear he looks 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.410
 already heard today kutxa century and I 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.450
 I will put it have always stopped the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.590
 everything and you've heard that when you change 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.510
 March 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.160
 there you are listening as a perez like a 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.080
 stereo yes as very peculiar and good 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.970
 very much tivo listeners will have to run 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.349
 very much is armored really I get 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.640
 the word I think that talking about going through 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.560
 the crystals the truth I have no unity 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.959
 but I think not and the truth is that I 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.819
 love is very very handsome reminds me of 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.229
 a car rest of the hot wheels there 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.419
 soccer cars that have always been like 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.220
 very hard to catch loop and that 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.660
 the whole subject in real life because I 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.070
 remember this car very much to those 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.260
 cars had the front kid 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.639
 look at the front that looks 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.889
 it's called karim curves and I do not remember 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.750
 bad and I really like the truth and for 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.100
 last guys I come to teach you here this 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.630
 motorcycle that was one of the most vehicles 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.979
 that I did not have to prove this dlc the 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.479
 good bank swallows one of the most 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.400
 obviously of those who happened for example 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.590
 the truck with the machine gun the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.000
 book and that but good in the case is that 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.290
 here I bring you the motorcycle is that has 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.389
 really want to try the because you look 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.520
 look at her from behind and something remembers me 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.139
 He remembers a lot the sanchez del san 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.400
 andreas the time the 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.990
 escapes they put the back part a 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.479
 little higher if there are angels wings 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.680
 Sanchez completely and apart the sound is 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.910
 It looks a lot like that of the 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.760
 sanchez del santander I am fond of 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.930
 lots this motorcycle who and how 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.750
 classic as I told you in the video of 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.490
 yesterday is some motorcycle like classic and but 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.639
 but sporty at the same time 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.900
 It's very modern like old media like that 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.060
 I wanted a lot of silk to try it and here the 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.650
 true that he has loved there is an attic 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.389
 poetically this we are going to look here the 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.759
 prices of what I have taught you we are going to 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.349
 look at one of the prices over here is that 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.139
 it is very cool of the vehicles and all the 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.020
 topic look at this costs 375 thousand 48,000 the 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.699
 motorcycle 125 thousand cars 525 thousand east 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.199
 car that is the same as this one but this 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.569
 example have civil and this in plan 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.800
 armored after we have here and here 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.270
 down I think the other bikes will be 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.430
 that we're going to give you I think there are some 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.449
 new I have unlocked but good the 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.039
 case is that I think that here below has 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.949
 that there are some against more than some 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:45.280
 another motorcycle as you squeeze to see if 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.900
 It is not really cheap and I think 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.259
 that is already effectively she is 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.580
 doing everything and then because unlike 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.580
 the vehicles and teaching more little things 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.940
 Thank you
