00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
there's my dogecoin counting out but I

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.469 
there's my dogecoin counting out but I
wanted<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.650> do<00:01:36.860> switch<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.820> feathercoin

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
wanted to do switch just do feathercoin

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.090 
wanted to do switch just do feathercoin
for<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.020> while<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:40.580> yeah<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:41.770> mining<00:01:42.770> header

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
for a while so yeah it's mining header

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:58.250 
for a while so yeah it's mining header
coin<00:01:43.400> forbidden

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.850 

I<00:01:58.290> could<00:01:59.070> even<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.550> have<00:02:00.150> it<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.630> mine<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
I could even go have it go mine the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.410 
I could even go have it go mine the
pre-order<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:04.010> for<00:02:05.240> October

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.230 

see<00:02:10.960> that<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:12.190> means<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.850> will<00:02:13.000> be

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
see that that means that it will be

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.260 
see that that means that it will be
mining<00:02:13.960> for<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.380> next<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> couple<00:02:16.120> months

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
from now or little over months or not it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.750
