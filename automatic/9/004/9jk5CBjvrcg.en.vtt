00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 Hello dear youtube community welcome 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.450
 here at my little app review for 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.480
 app downloads i test this here today 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.210
 with the ipad four of my own 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 private jet 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.170
 what is it about good news it is one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 Great app for students a perfect 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.300
 solution for lectures or seminars 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.840
 you have to complete your internship there or 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 just about your pdf documents or others 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.149
 writes documents to manage what can 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.739
 I do with the app you can do one here 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:43.879
 create art notebook while doing yours 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.879
 scribble small notes over there 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.860
 that is very easy it is yes 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.300
 user friendly and the app is running 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 very stable 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 Of course, others could do it too 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.210
 templates use instead of just being empty 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.649
 There is also a checkered paper here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 paper lined or a note paper 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.360
 That may be great if he is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 we are planning the next youtube song here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 first take a line of paper 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 in landscape format 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.080
 you have a tool bar up here 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.299
 with different tools he is now 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.189
 write here with the pen again 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.680
 You can do different colors 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 You can choose different strengths of the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 Select the pen we just sign times 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.750
 hellos continue to make a hello 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.759
 had the opportunity to do that again 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 delete with the radio rur takes that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.280
 lasso tool and pull that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
 written on to another location 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.159
 In addition, you still have the opportunity 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.189
 if he draws something more accurate 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.990
 wanted this precision tool here 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.479
 apply I just draw even a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 square does not say as I let go 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.409
 if you have a perfect square 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 whole is synonymous with other form in the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.380
 circle is not that easy 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.810
 that's more of an ellipse good though 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.329
 a circle you can see that it really is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.040
 especially if you are 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.840
 flowchart or something like that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 can then here in the simplest way 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.489
 a few more arrows if you are 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.890
 rather type in the whole volt instead 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.590
 here to scribble 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.760
 then you can just a new page 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.510
 add that with two already 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.110
 fumble 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.819
 so you can add a page and 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.160
 you want to do a text then hold on 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.420
 her the pen is this overview comes 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.770
 and can select text and jojo can 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.520
 I then enter 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.530
 hello youtube madness that we are there 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.720
 relatively he would rather know something 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.459
 the whole thing should also be scribbled 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 be readable then I recommend you 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.220
 here this magnifying tool so you can 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.940
 set this area bigger and bigger 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.130
 make it smaller and you can your note 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.650
 just write in this enlarged one 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.920
 area and you see it is easier 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.019
 as if I were with my little one 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.840
 sausage finger experiments are that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.630
 Accordingly, you all crappy 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.250
 have the possibility of different 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.470
 insert file formats here you can 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.350
 add pdf documents we'll take a look 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.780
 in here if you say you want that 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.750
 whole from euro dropbox so google drive 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.230
 order or there are still the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.190
 possibility to use wifi files too 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.769
 transfer 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.190
 from the pc directly or the first ipad 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.070
 would have to connect so you can now 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.120
 quite simply here a pdf document 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.690
 Select and there is added rich 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.360
 we'll see pure 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.870
 it is a practice of 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.340
 ten ways of the college mittweida and 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.910
 more precisely , he could just grow up in it 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.950
 small hum it just look at it all 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.780
 By the way, this is the reading mode 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.930
 He made no changes in the document 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.150
 or you say human that is 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.239
 We want to mark the transfer of knowledge 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.790
 and you can also speak it in the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.220
 take lessons live 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.260
 in the documents of her professors and 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.359
 and internet so you have already seen 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.060
 There is a dropbox involvement with her 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.220
 you can have the whole thing mirrored like that 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.260
 that all documents he creates here 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.269
 Immediately in the dropbox are not either 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.520
 get lost within the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.950
 In addition, pdf documents could also 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.620
 Manage your pages individually 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.840
 you just go to edit and see 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.700
 you could have an overview of all pages 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.720
 Add new ones and say now 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:39.500
 publisher still notepad and yes 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.190
 add my own notes that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.780
 whole is also very handy if you 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.770
 she wanted to edit her document 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.380
 only the most important content leaves much 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.960
 i can negate the pdf document 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.280
 actually do not tell about this app 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.530
 I only had a little mistake 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.610
 at that time in a previous version was there 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.310
 it is a problem with the dropbox 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.710
 Reflection and there I was immediately 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.270
 via twitter from the developer himself 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.520
 helped that is of course very 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.170
 he may continue to be exemplary 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.170
 but outdated design 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.830
 you can see it in a rustic shelf here 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.590
 background 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.050
 this is determined by the 1 7 update 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.270
 then fixed in the future by the developer 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.810
 yes, and we're already on it 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.090
 The End 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.140
 i hope i could give you the app something 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.450
 bring closer 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.800
 The whole thing has fallen can me 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.780
 like to rate positively 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.510
 below in the comments could ask me 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.200
 do not subscribe then yes 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.160
 to forget 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.160
 So then
