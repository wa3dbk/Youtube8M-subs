00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.559
 Hello

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.650

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.150
 lipstick 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.939
 let's start immediately then start from 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.939
 from the art of construction of cupid indeed 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 in this way to trace 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.320
 and define 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.280
 precisely niardo after video 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.350
 very disappointed whose video 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.430
 I open my mouth slightly 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.020
 and I'm going to finish the line coming 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.020
 precisely up to the corners of the mouth 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.970
 also are 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.350
 those slightly inside 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 this hand 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.130
 most under their own one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.790
 lightly part the lips 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.790
 in this way 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 and the same careers did the center 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.790
 and they are very very light 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.060
 it fills with water 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.700
 apply the pencil 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.360

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.330

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.090
 segments cate villus before doing so 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.930
 and now I'm going to read below too 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.930

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:30.390
 mister that latita or will imitate to speak 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.990
 mostly my best set up there 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.990
 I hope 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.890
 anything 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.920
 explains see well 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.410
 now I take a small brush so it helps 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.230
 this is an old lipstick now 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:03.420
 fake and how I use lipstick as a lipstick 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:09.180
 392 of the kiko which is precisely this 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:14.069
 beautiful red lacquered red and indeed 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:18.299
 I am going to pick up the brush with the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.840
 lipstick and I'm going to apply it on lele 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.229
 blue raspberry 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.870
 starting from below more or less good changes 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:30.500
 we are obliged to the center and then I go 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.500
 on the side 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 careful 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.409
 this way 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.669
 it's a mind I know 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.419
 part from the corner of the guide and acciona 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.420
 and no 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.420
 and nothing to call it the genius of the tip 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.120
 I'm going to color 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.120
 the rest 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.740
 but can't 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.350
 here 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.190
 I can tell you about the race but I know 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.700
 up to the center it won't hurt you and this is it 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.700
 the 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.930
 result 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.930
