00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.940
 because people Son 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.350
 tenth day of play this song 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.830
 and this time there is no further encounter 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.459
 but 200 commit 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.459
 Picture 2 Special conditions 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.789
 only commerce around a z 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.039
 the first one plays this game day 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.919
 with FC Schalke 04 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.470
 Werder Bremen 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 this zappa I'm on 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.409
 the next meeting is between 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.030
 Eintracht Frankfurt and the TSG Hoffenheim and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.010
 the Frankfurt have 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 no game against Hoffmann 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.630
 that will continue to be so it will be a draw 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 one to one 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.160
 the next encounter process between Borussia Mönchengladbach RPO 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.320
 FSV Mainz 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 in their last five encounters 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.660
 overall in this care 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.660
 Although both have only one way 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.090
 the Mainz have four defeats 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.080
 Gladbach has a draw and three defeats 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.680
 and 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.280
 I think the Mainzers will be now 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.640
 to make it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.330
 revive 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
 and crack it with a 10 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.900
 the SRG good between the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.580
 c Freiburg and Borussia Dortmund 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.970
 and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.370
 this eg me 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.710
 also on one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 2 to 1 expose 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.800
 Let us now turn to Hannover AG GM 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.700
 HSV 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.679
 in this encounter came on some hanover fans of memory 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.569
 noticeably 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.569
 her keeper then left Robert Enke 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.979
 he was no longer in the goal of Hannover 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.039
 this encounter 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.039
 I'm guessing a draw 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.299
 the next meeting 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.239
 that between the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.869
 first FC Nuremberg 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.339
 and the first FC Kaiserslautern 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.499
 There I think that wins in Lautern 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.499
 with a 3 1 2 1 victory 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.249
 now the top match of this game day 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.579
 if I'm between 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.579

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:09.949
 Georges 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.949
 I suppose will give a hot fight 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.099
 and this hot fight 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.099
