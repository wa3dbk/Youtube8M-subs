00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 do not 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.920
 hello everyone I'm without hector know that 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.750
 It's been over a year since he picked me up 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.270
 copy of pokemon x that I acquired in 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.320
 presale and the store where the part I 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.320
 gave this away 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.740
 and is that the truth is that name is more 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.300
 impressive of what you have inside and 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.160
 the beginning I thought it was like a 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.680
 kind of case or something like that but also 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.780
 they gave me this little manual book 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 that explains 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.820
 and it's a little different it has different 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.240
 different sceneries boards and me 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.610
 It seems interesting but try to enter 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.090
 the website that is annotated 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.620
 here 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.950
 and it turns out that the game is 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.380
 discontinued so these pieces no longer 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.140
 they really serve and I thought it could be 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.150
 to recycle these little pieces and the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.760
 wall that I have behind me and I thought that 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.410
 I was a little lonely so the chips 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.600
 that come here I think to stick them in the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.280
 back I'll keep making videos and 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.379
 Well, the back wall is going to be the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.380
 main stage so I think that 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.090
 It would be better if they have more things and for 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 I 'm doing this video, let's see what 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.710
 has in 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.590
 The first thing we find inside is 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.329
 on the blank card and on 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.829
 and finally the chips because he's going 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:31.109
 your name tails and magma and they are all 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.819
 exactly the same on both sides and 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.009
 I really thought that they could be used 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.560
 like cups but they are cardboard then 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.959
 some time they should really throw them 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.719
 they do not turn anything and they are equal of both 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.290
 sides then it would not be of great help 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.710
 let's open 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 it has already stopped 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:59.370
 Pokemon discreet tour to date 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.870
 pokemon for your disk and this time more a 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.870
 white attack that does not help 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.750
 and in this case we have a decal of 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.500
 gift already dice pikachu because balls and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.390
 in the back we have the data 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.640
 statisticians of these two mouths and 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.910
 in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.350
 more chips 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:31.030
 electro here this pizza shines and she 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.310
 or end and any are six tokens in 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.320
 Overall I no longer how much it cost 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.970
 this in his times but I hope not 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.550
 has been really expensive because then 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.990
 honestly they are not the great thing 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.860
 although they are pretty but 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.730
 let's stick them 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.450
 smith r 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 sylvain 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.959
 well they were already stuck 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.910
 really 225 because it's shining shines 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.180
 and I do not want to paste it so the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.739
 will keep in a different place 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.200
 I really want to continue to follow 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.420
 making videos so this wall is going 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 to become my main stage and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.439
 I think I'll be hitting different things 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.989
 but I do not know what I intend to do videos of 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.390
 origami and each piece that maybe makes the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.639
 stick in word if you have any idea of 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.280
 that can stick on this wall do not hesitate 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.019
 leave it in the comments and if you guys 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.980

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.989
 because I have not found better alone 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.430
