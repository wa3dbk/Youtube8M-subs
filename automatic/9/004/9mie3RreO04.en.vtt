00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:14.960
 to be sexy is in the attitude and why not 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.349
 in the makeup so in this video 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.100
 I will teach you how to achieve a good makeup 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.740
 sexy and very strong for you so 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.670
 let's start let's start by applying 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.849
 a pre-base of a plan so that our 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.430
 shadows are asked much better for this 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.949
 use the color tattoo on the tone 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.760
 white on the entire mobile eyelid then 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.790
 I'm going to use a brown shadow in everything 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.860
 the mobile eyelid with a brush for 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.190
 blur I will intensify what 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.489
 would be the socket of our eye with a 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.830
 chocolate shadow let's blur very 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.500
 very very well and what we are going to achieve with 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.650
 this makeup is a smoked in tone 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.650
 Brown 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.670
 It is important that you please 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.010
 perfect and for this I'm going to grab a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.220
 clean brush and I'm going to blur this 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 stroke or this cut that we can see in 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.120
 our then with a clear shadow or 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.610
 it can be your body can fight but 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.710
 something very very slight under our eyebrow 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.890
 Now we are going to give it a little touch 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.590
 little different but well nba this 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 makeup and we will do it with a shadow 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 you get an eyeliner in a green tone 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.690
 or golden then apply cheesemaking in the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.600
 inner area of ​​my eye and this is going to be 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.780
 a spectacular effect then I'm going to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.259
 delineate on the outside with a finite brush 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.869
 and with the brown tone that I used in the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.149
 basin then let's light up a little bit 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.420
 so I'm going to put this color tattoo 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.280
 in gold on my lacrimal then the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.050
 eyeliner definitely can not 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.590
 miss so for this 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.650
 to grab my liquid eyeliner and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.890
 do a pretty thick outline already 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.330
 what is my taste you can do it more 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.330
 finite or as it is 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.460
 then I will move to the lips tube 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.240
 use this burgundy tone of the brand 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.680
 baldwin that is a red well burned well 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.680
 strong and very intense 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.459
 Two girls this makeup is 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.489
 simply spectacular 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.590
 and of course you should not forget to apply 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.480
