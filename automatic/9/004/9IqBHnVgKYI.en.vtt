00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
there's both of them saw time at like I

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.850 
there's both of them saw time at like I
said<00:00:37.000> Attack<00:00:37.629> Position<00:00:37.899> as<00:00:38.260> well<00:00:38.469> as<00:00:38.620> left

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
said Attack Position as well as left

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.400

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
were working together in tandem so

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.670 
were working together in tandem so
they're<00:00:43.960> gonna<00:00:44.170> be<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.289> little<00:00:44.440> bit<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.649> a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
they're gonna be a little bit of a

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.590 
they're gonna be a little bit of a
transition<00:00:44.890> there<00:00:45.399> but<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:45.850> really<00:00:46.270> like<00:00:46.420> to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
transition there but I really like to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.630 
transition there but I really like to
athletic<00:00:47.109> upside<00:00:47.500> we<00:00:47.739> saw<00:00:47.949> that<00:00:48.129> in<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.309> game

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
athletic upside we saw that in the game

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.279 
athletic upside we saw that in the game
as<00:00:48.910> well<00:00:49.120> as<00:00:49.270> earlier<00:00:49.690> practices<00:00:50.199> you

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
as well as earlier practices you

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.139 
as well as earlier practices you
mentioned<00:00:50.649> so<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:51.070> just<00:00:51.489> like<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.760> fact<00:00:51.969> that

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
mentioned so I just like the fact that

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.779 
mentioned so I just like the fact that
their<00:00:53.019> level<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.590> play<00:00:53.859> is<00:00:53.920> continuing<00:00:54.609> to

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
their level of play is continuing to

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.660 
their level of play is continuing to
rise<00:00:55.030> rather<00:00:55.539> clock<00:00:55.930> now<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.530> then<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.489> guess

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
rise rather clock now and then I guess

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.860 
rise rather clock now and then I guess
you<00:00:57.760> probably<00:00:57.879> got<00:00:58.149> to<00:00:58.269> watch<00:00:58.449> some<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.719> those

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
you probably got to watch some of those

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.810 
you probably got to watch some of those
defensive<00:00:59.379> line<00:00:59.559> guys<00:00:59.859> as<00:01:00.100> well<00:01:00.280> since<00:01:00.699> you're

game at least in terms of what the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.890 
game at least in terms of what the
organization<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.459> said<00:02:21.700> about<00:02:21.819> him<00:02:22.150> what<00:02:22.780> have

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
organization is said about him what have

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900 
organization is said about him what have
you<00:02:23.019> thought<00:02:23.200> about<00:02:23.260> his<00:02:23.620> place<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.099> far<00:02:24.250> but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
you thought about his place so far but

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.580 
you thought about his place so far but
to<00:02:25.299> me<00:02:25.420> he's<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.599> little<00:02:25.810> straight<00:02:26.019> line<00:02:26.200> which

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
to me he's a little straight line which

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.500 
to me he's a little straight line which
isn't<00:02:26.890> surprising<00:02:27.010> considering<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.239> his

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
isn't surprising considering that is his

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.150 
isn't surprising considering that is his
background<00:02:29.049> in<00:02:29.200> high<00:02:29.319> school<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.799> all<00:02:29.950> that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
background in high school and all that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.309 
background in high school and all that
wasn't<00:02:30.579> hockey<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.480> he<00:02:31.930> has<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.109> give<00:02:32.230> our

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
wasn't hockey and so he has to give our

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.599 
wasn't hockey and so he has to give our
hockey<00:02:32.470> players<00:02:32.889> of<00:02:33.099> course<00:02:33.310> they're<00:02:33.489> there

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
hockey players of course they're there

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.250 
hockey players of course they're there
because<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:34.030> big<00:02:34.299> tough<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:34.780> if<00:02:34.870> he<00:02:34.959> used<00:02:35.170> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
because a big tough but if he used to
