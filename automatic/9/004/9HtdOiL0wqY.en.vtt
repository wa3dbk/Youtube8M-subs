whole potato or let's cut it down the
center<00:00:45.090> let's<00:00:45.239> try<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:46.129> there<00:00:47.129> that'll<00:00:47.460> work

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
center let's try that there that'll work

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.360 
center let's try that there that'll work
and<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.800> these<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> heal

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and you're going to want these to heal

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
and you're going to want these to heal
over<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:51.030> until<00:00:51.930> you're<00:00:52.079> healed<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.620> until

over for until you're healed over until
they<00:00:52.949> turn<00:00:53.129> brown<00:00:53.309> before<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> plant<00:00:54.210> them

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
they turn brown before you plant them

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
they turn brown before you plant them

especially if you are having a lot of
rain<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.890> best<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> let<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.579> heal

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
