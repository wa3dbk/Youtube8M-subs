00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.679
 At first in this water 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.679
 Overall 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.680
 Make a te and 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.760
 Mixed ultramarine and permanent loin 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.010
 Ride 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.010
 I will put on 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.270
 Place while white thing about leaving atmosphere at the sounds Clouds 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 Ijima I will 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420
 Is it feeling 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.960
 Let's also paint the lower side a little 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.070
 Also it'd become lower half pick-up 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.409
 So dark color is high 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.420
 here 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.180
 It would be funny if an association is made 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 Firmly down to 4 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 Keep it moist 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.600
 Well once ultramarine and permanent rate 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.480
 I hit it but 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.850
 Because I want the color change a little more 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.909
 Oh yeah 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.469
 It has been 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.469
 A little in order to gray 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.450
 Yellow car 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.050
 I did not mix Yule cherry blossoms with permantlet 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.340
 A little school in the dark 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.340
 I will try with the management of Wetty 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.530
 The wind is looking at this now 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.680
 It is opening done with for calligraphy 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.340
 The clouds are open 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.340
 Because it is feeling 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.490
 About 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.330
 It is near the bottom of the cloud 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.720
 Because it is dark 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.720
 I'm making it dark now 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.860
 Also put a reddish color 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.660
 Also put permanent red something like 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.660
 I want to feel a little brighter 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.910
 I will do my best 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.910
 Because the color becomes cloudy 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.430
 gradually 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.200
 I see 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.200
 In'll dryer 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.580
 Shake the dryer back and forth 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.770
 It from the other hand will flow where there is only in the direction 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.599
 Putsu 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.349
 I wrote a little about half and want to leave some more tissue tissue 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.349
 Wipe with 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.250
 It is said that Chung Chung 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.600
 Pack down 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.090
 After the lift out 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.600
 Why even the difference is I have a hard dream a little more tissue paper 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.470
 The ship this clean by boat 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.470
 With water 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.500
 With a brush 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.780
 Wipe off 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.780
