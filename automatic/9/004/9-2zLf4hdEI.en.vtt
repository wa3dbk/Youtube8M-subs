00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello, good morning, welcome to the channel 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.730
 very creative 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.759
 Today you talk back in knitting. 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.830
 speak in interlacing and now I go 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.529
 to teach you how to do the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.109
 triangles on the left side of the work 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.090
 remembering that in the first official video 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.550
 of base angles 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.470
 in the second I taught the triangles of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.250
 right side a third 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 the squares and falling to the left 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 now let's go to the side triangle 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
 left of work 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.780
 we arrived here at the end of the UN 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 last 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 now it's more or less the same as 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.690
 I had already taught you to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
 make the triangle 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.649
 we are going to raise four points then 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.649
 Likewise 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 23 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.100
 and 4 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.869
 of work and now there is a 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.780
 different way 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:21.640
 I'll get the first two points 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.640
 together two together 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.130
 the third and fourth points 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.830
 be careful not to pick up the stitches 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.510
 here is not this square 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.130
 square we let him want to leave 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.440
 prepared that we will work more 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.750
 now we only have three stitches on the needle that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:49.450
 We got two together, I'll do it. 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:53.170
 these three points here with 23 points and 6 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.170
 thousand at work 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 I'll get two points together. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.070
 and one more 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.180
 at work 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.930
 Look, I only have two stitches to knit. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 in 620 work 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.000
 so these two points together 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.560
 This is the triangle of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.180
 edge of the left side is already 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.890
 Ready's it 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.320
 remembering that the staff here I 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.210
 working with my four points 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.110
 triangle in my squares has four 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.360
 points 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.530
 You can make yours with how many points. 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.180
 you want 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.959
 remembering that everyone must have the same 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.540
 amount and has three equal points here 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.300
 I'll keep this point the needle're 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.100
 In case we are side of cars we are 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.370
 on the inside 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.239
 this point he stays here because from here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.600
 in this space open to games 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.530
 Let's lift the first square that 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.640
 It's going to be now if we were coming. 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.280
 in this direction 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.640
 Now we're going in the opposite direction. 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.860
 now we are going to come back 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.430
 Only this I'll leave to the next 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.739
 video so nobody gets lost to ok 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.320
 so I want you to train well 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.910
 these first videos any doubt 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.690
 leave a comment you're not 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.880
 registered 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.440
 click on the screen or click low or 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.989
 filmed right sign up and I hope 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.540
 who has not registered any doubt 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.489
 ok, do not forget the work will stop 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.160
 thus already with a point 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.780
 already on the street on the right side very 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.209
 Thank you for your visit. 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.260
 This technique is a delight 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.260
 A hug, bye, bye.
