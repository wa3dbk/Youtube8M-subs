can so obviously you'll have a lot of

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.620 
can so obviously you'll have a lot of
extra<00:04:17.100> left<00:04:17.280> if<00:04:17.370> you're<00:04:17.489> making<00:04:17.670> one<00:04:18.030> if

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
extra left if you're making one if

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.849 
extra left if you're making one if
you're<00:04:18.810> only<00:04:18.870> making<00:04:18.989> one<00:04:19.230> burrito<00:04:19.590> and

you're only making one burrito and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.560 
you're only making one burrito and
that's<00:04:20.489> why<00:04:20.640> these<00:04:20.700> containers<00:04:21.269> are<00:04:21.299> really

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.000 
that's why these containers are really
helpful<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.019> can<00:04:22.140> store<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.560> rest<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
helpful so you can store the rest in the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.730 
helpful so you can store the rest in the
