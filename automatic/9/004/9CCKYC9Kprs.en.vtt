okay<00:00:01.829> now<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.070> have<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.580> internal<00:00:03.060> anatomy<00:00:03.419> of

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
okay now we have the internal anatomy of

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.970 
okay now we have the internal anatomy of
the<00:00:05.460> sagittal<00:00:05.670> section<00:00:06.410> first<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the sagittal section first we have the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.530 
the sagittal section first we have the
Mayo<00:00:08.189> septa<00:00:09.139> the<00:00:10.139> lines<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:11.639> right<00:00:12.300> now

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
Mayo septa the lines and right now

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780 
Mayo septa the lines and right now
Louisa<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.230> poking<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.799> pin<00:00:14.460> through<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
Louisa is poking the pin through the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.590 
Louisa is poking the pin through the
Maya<00:00:15.000> septa<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.750> then<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:17.400> between<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.330> miles

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
Maya septa and then in between the miles

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.920 
Maya septa and then in between the miles
left<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> mile<00:00:19.260> mirrors<00:00:20.630> then<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.779> move

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
left are the mile mirrors then we move

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.939 
left are the mile mirrors then we move
on<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.500> circular<00:00:23.039> muscle<00:00:23.810> which<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.140> all

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
on to the circular muscle which is all

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.130 
on to the circular muscle which is all
around<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.640> truth<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.060> organs<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.810> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
around the truth like organs it's it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.130 
around the truth like organs it's it
looks<00:00:28.380> light<00:00:29.039> yellow<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.960> it's<00:00:30.960> all

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
looks light yellow in this it's all

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.430 
looks light yellow in this it's all
around<00:00:31.410> there<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.969> now<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:34.079> lingual

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
around there and now the lingual

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.330 
around there and now the lingual
cartilage<00:00:36.469> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.770> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> hard<00:00:38.190> because

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
cartilage this is kind of hard because

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
cartilage this is kind of hard because
you<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> feel<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> know

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you have to kind of feel it to know

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.100 
you have to kind of feel it to know
where<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.300> but<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> feels<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.960> tooth

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
where it is but it feels like a tooth

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
where it is but it feels like a tooth
there<00:00:49.940> there<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
there there it is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.950 
there there it is
and<00:00:52.399> then<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.969> behind<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> lingual

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and then right behind it is a lingual

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.490 
and then right behind it is a lingual
muscle<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.719> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.960> leads<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
muscle so that kind of leads to the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.470 
muscle so that kind of leads to the
muscle<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> branchial<00:01:00.449> pouch

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
muscle then we have the branchial pouch

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.640 
muscle then we have the branchial pouch
the<00:01:03.480> branchial<00:01:03.690> pouch<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> section<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
the branchial pouch is like a section of

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
the branchial pouch is like a section of
what<00:01:07.650> lewis<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> circling<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> pen

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what lewis is kind of circling the pen

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
what lewis is kind of circling the pen
the<00:01:10.140> pen<00:01:10.290> around<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> looks<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the pen around it kind of looks like a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
the pen around it kind of looks like a
rectangle<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.380> includes<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.610> gill

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
rectangle and then it includes the gill

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.320 
rectangle and then it includes the gill
filaments<00:01:15.619> which<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> red<00:01:17.330> filaments

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
filaments which are the red filaments

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.230 
filaments which are the red filaments
they<00:01:18.930> appear<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> red<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:21.119> she

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
they appear to be red and then what she

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.740 
they appear to be red and then what she
is<00:01:21.390> lifting<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.930> those<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> actual<00:01:22.890> slits

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
is lifting up those are the actual slits

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.010 
is lifting up those are the actual slits
the<00:01:24.750> internal<00:01:25.229> gill<00:01:25.409> slits<00:01:25.909> okay<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the internal gill slits okay we got that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020 
the internal gill slits okay we got that
then<00:01:28.829> we're<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.400> go<00:01:29.549> find<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
then we're going to go find the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.710 
then we're going to go find the
olfactory<00:01:30.420> sack<00:01:34.220> olfactory<00:01:35.220> sack<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.180> right

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
olfactory sack olfactory sack is right

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.179 
olfactory sack olfactory sack is right
there<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.500> dark<00:01:38.090> right<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> middle<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
there it's dark right in the middle and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
there it's dark right in the middle and
then<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.850> next<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.270> those<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.560> olfactory

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
then right next to those the olfactory

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.210 
then right next to those the olfactory
sack<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.000> hypophyseal<00:01:45.329> sack<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.350> that's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
sack is the hypophyseal sack and that's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.630 
sack is the hypophyseal sack and that's
the<00:01:47.430> cavity<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:49.009> it's<00:01:50.009> kind<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> side

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the cavity so it's kind of on the side

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.120 
the cavity so it's kind of on the side
in<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.880> cavity

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
in this cavity

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:04.429 
in this cavity
okay<00:01:53.479> then<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.259> esophagus

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.070 

let's<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.460> where<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> esophagus<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:08.810> okay<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
let's see where the esophagus is okay I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.470 
let's see where the esophagus is okay I
think<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> was<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:11.879> here<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.819> thing<00:02:15.269> right

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
think it was right here this thing right

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.860 
think it was right here this thing right
here

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
here

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170 
here
oh<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.650> there<00:02:16.830> okay<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.760> goes<00:02:17.970> all

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
oh right there okay and that goes all

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
oh right there okay and that goes all
the<00:02:18.209> way<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.390> bingo<00:02:19.370> mm-hmm<00:02:20.629> all<00:02:21.629> right<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the way to bingo mm-hmm all right so

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.809 
the way to bingo mm-hmm all right so
that<00:02:22.379> tube<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.890> esophagus<00:02:25.340> notochord<00:02:26.340> and

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
that tube is the esophagus notochord and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.710 
that tube is the esophagus notochord and
nerve<00:02:26.970> cord<00:02:27.330> our<00:02:27.660> necks<00:02:30.560> nodal<00:02:31.560> cord<00:02:32.720> all

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
nerve cord our necks nodal cord all

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240 
nerve cord our necks nodal cord all
right<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.319> under<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.040> nerve

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
right and then under that is the nerve

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.110 
right and then under that is the nerve
cord<00:02:35.610> or<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.180> should<00:02:36.420> say<00:02:36.599> above<00:02:36.930> sorry<00:02:38.120> looking

the<00:02:39.239> wrong<00:02:39.329> way<00:02:41.569> we<00:02:42.569> have<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> nerve<00:02:42.989> cord

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
the wrong way we have the nerve cord

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:53.420 
the wrong way we have the nerve cord
then<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.489> nodal<00:02:44.819> cord<00:02:45.060> underneath<00:02:52.430> the

then the nodal cord underneath the
dorsal<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.209> Horta<00:02:56.359> right<00:02:57.359> there's<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> dorsal

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
dorsal a Horta right there's the dorsal

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.309 
dorsal a Horta right there's the dorsal

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.539 
aorta and the ventral a Horta it's to it
right<00:03:04.319> there<00:03:04.560> okay<00:03:04.799> we<00:03:05.670> got<00:03:05.849> those<00:03:06.180> down<00:03:07.549> all

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
right there okay we got those down all

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.099 
right there okay we got those down all
right<00:03:08.760> then<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.209> down<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> transverse

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
right then we go down to the transverse

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.460 
right then we go down to the transverse
septum<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.700> transverse<00:03:12.000> septum<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.750> like

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
septum and the transverse septum is like

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.190 
septum and the transverse septum is like
the<00:03:13.620> purple<00:03:14.040> outer<00:03:14.730> layer<00:03:15.299> covering<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.079> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the purple outer layer covering of the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.750 
the purple outer layer covering of the
heart<00:03:18.079> okay<00:03:19.079> we're<00:03:19.319> gonna<00:03:19.500> lift<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.280> heart<00:03:20.489> oh

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
heart okay we're gonna lift the heart oh

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.809 
heart okay we're gonna lift the heart oh
my<00:03:21.630> gosh<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.319> heart<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.739> fell<00:03:22.919> out<00:03:23.209> here's<00:03:24.209> a

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
my gosh the heart just fell out here's a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.390 
my gosh the heart just fell out here's a
transverse<00:03:26.819> septum<00:03:27.510> yep<00:03:27.919> right<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.130> then<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
transverse septum yep right and then the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.009 
transverse septum yep right and then the
white<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.569> sinus<00:03:30.930> venosus<00:03:31.160> yeah<00:03:32.900> there<00:03:33.900> it

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
white is the sinus venosus yeah there it

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.520 
white is the sinus venosus yeah there it
is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.339 
is
then<00:03:35.519> we<00:03:35.669> have<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.480> intestine<00:03:38.750> yep<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
then we have the intestine yep the

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.920 
then we have the intestine yep the
rubber<00:03:40.560> band<00:03:40.799> flap<00:03:41.250> thing<00:03:41.750> there's<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
rubber band flap thing there's the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.120 
rubber band flap thing there's the
intestine<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.880> liver
