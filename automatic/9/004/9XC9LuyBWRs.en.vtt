otherwise you can't keep kick up your

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.610 
otherwise you can't keep kick up your
joints<00:02:40.790> won't<00:02:41.000> let<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.360> one<00:02:41.989> more<00:02:42.110> time<00:02:42.260> one

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620

two<00:02:43.569> three

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.250 

another<00:02:56.000> thing<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.480> watch<00:02:56.510> when<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.110> do

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
another thing to watch when you do

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.890 
another thing to watch when you do
spinning<00:02:57.799> side<00:02:58.069> kick<00:02:58.099> is<00:02:58.670> how<00:02:59.239> your<00:02:59.450> line<00:02:59.720> your

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
spinning side kick is how your line your

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.679 
spinning side kick is how your line your
body<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.470> because<00:03:01.459> common<00:03:01.879> mistakes<00:03:02.329> with

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
body and because common mistakes with

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.210 
body and because common mistakes with
spin<00:03:03.319> side<00:03:03.650> kick<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:04.069> you<00:03:04.159> rotate<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.849> kick

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
spin side kick when you rotate and kick

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.089 
spin side kick when you rotate and kick
so<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.280> turn<00:03:07.579> your<00:03:07.760> body<00:03:08.140> all<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.560> way<00:03:09.590> here

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
so you turn your body all the way here

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.690 
so you turn your body all the way here
and<00:03:10.370> your<00:03:11.299> momentum<00:03:11.780> will<00:03:11.840> spool<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.430> around

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
and your momentum will spool you around

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.100 
and your momentum will spool you around
so<00:03:13.819> it's<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.120> kind<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.450> instead<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> going

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
so it's just kind of instead of going

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.050 
so it's just kind of instead of going
through<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.530> tag<00:03:15.739> if<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.010> kind<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.310> just

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
through the tag if you kind of just

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.690 
through the tag if you kind of just
graze<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.349> like<00:03:18.530> it's<00:03:18.890> very<00:03:19.129> muchi<00:03:19.400> kick

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
graze it on like it's very muchi kick

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.979 
graze it on like it's very muchi kick
it's<00:03:19.849> not<00:03:20.599> very<00:03:20.840> powerful<00:03:21.579> so<00:03:22.579> again<00:03:23.510> when<00:03:23.900> you

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
it's not very powerful so again when you

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.460 
it's not very powerful so again when you
rotate<00:03:24.939> try<00:03:25.939> to<00:03:26.000> keep<00:03:26.329> your<00:03:26.540> body's<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.170> stop

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
rotate try to keep your body's you stop

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.869 
rotate try to keep your body's you stop
rotation<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.040> goes<00:03:28.190> through<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.670> target

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
rotation it goes through the target

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.490 
rotation it goes through the target
again<00:03:29.209> from<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.310> instead<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.079> like

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
again from here instead of going like

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.280 
again from here instead of going like
this<00:03:35.319> people<00:03:36.319> just<00:03:36.349> try<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.370> turn<00:03:37.730> their<00:03:37.909> body

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
this people just try to turn their body

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.379 
this people just try to turn their body
too<00:03:39.290> quickly<00:03:39.620> over<00:03:39.950> here<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.909> momentum

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
too quickly over here and the momentum

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.839 
too quickly over here and the momentum
is<00:03:41.480> proving<00:03:41.840> them<00:03:42.019> back<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.400> need<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.700> get

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
is proving them back so you need to get

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.979 
is proving them back so you need to get
through<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.569> target<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.200> see<00:03:45.849> your<00:03:46.849> body<00:03:47.090> is
