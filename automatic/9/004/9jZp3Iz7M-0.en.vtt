00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello everyone greets you the harpy 222 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 as you already know the new movie of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.740
 jurassic park is falling will be called 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.750
 jurassic world and seen the trailers I 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.529
 I would like to comment on what I think 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.199
 respect does not do anything in the superbowl it 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.539
 premiered the second trailer which looks 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 better visually and we can see the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.090
 hybrid dinosaur some parts 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.310
 giving us an idea of ​​how it is so 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.740
 we have been able to observe in the trailer is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.290
 the movie basically goes that the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 park is now open to the public with 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.780
 a wide range of species among them 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 the apatosaurus the stegosaurus and even 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.149
 a mosasaur although the latter is not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 it's about a dinosaur attractions 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.980
 are similar or different from the one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.170
 previous park with spheres by way of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.469
 beat I do not know what they are called a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.809
 the aquatic show and the park 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.020
 over time he has problems because the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 people get tired of the dinosaurs this 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 makes the doctor henry book create a 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.600
 hybrid dinosaur to attract more 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.729
 attention to the park 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.820
 everything is fine until this new 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.979
 bigger dinosaur ready strong and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.799
 agile than the other dinosaurs of the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.190
 park escapes and begins to sow the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.439
 chaos and terror in the park in order the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.080
 plot is not nothing special but not 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.530
 It's bad in my opinion this movie can 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.390
 be good although I have certain doubts a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.399
 of the reasons why I have them is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.799
 for the well-known abductors 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.990
 bloodhound controlled by owen the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.450
 protagonist played by chris 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.550
 pratt is very rare to see how of the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.679
 smart hunters from the first 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.770
 movie become pets 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.569
 trained I imagine that the reason why 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 the one that gets along well with the prota is 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.550
 by his own intelligence in the third 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 They saw how they were as intelligent as 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.569
 to talk to each other this makes me 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 think that the prota has managed to 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.700
 some way to be understood with them as 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.560
 if they were another different culture the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 absence of previous prots 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.239
 It is also a reason for my doubts but 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.310
 It seems logical to me that they do not appear 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.260
 you should dig for a story 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.540
 forced to come again 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.489
 remember that the reasons why 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.159
 they came for the second time and they have wrong with 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.189
 alan grant and han was to rescue his 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.519
 girlfriend while alan because good is 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.519
 sold 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.329
 well now let's talk about the dinosaur more 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.560
 important of the movie the dinosaur 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.599
 hybrid in dominus rex before known 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.519
 as díaz vélez rex is the new 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.579
 antagonist of the saga his name 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.500
 means violent or untamable king was 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.900
 created to revive the park the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.090
 lack of visitors with the hope of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.060
 that this new acquisition would attract 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.650
 attention to create it henri doctor 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.909
 blue mixed the genome of several 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.359
 dinosaurs which are carnotauro 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.159
 gigantosaurus yungas saurio and robots in 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.680
 dominus rex can run up 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.989
 speeds of 30 miles per hour and its 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 roar is as strong as the takeoff and 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.159
 landing of a boeing 747 aircraft according to 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.819
 owen the hybrid does not hunt prey for purposes 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.220
 of survival but because of sport 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.859
 last here goes some images of the hybrid 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.280
 If you do not want to see by spoiler, close the 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.280
