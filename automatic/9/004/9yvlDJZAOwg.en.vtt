00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.400 
advances that have happened in the last
couple<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.030> years<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.569> given<00:02:16.900> us<00:02:17.020> insight

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
couple of years have given us insight

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.650 
couple of years have given us insight
that<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.739> fact<00:02:17.950> malignant<00:02:18.940> brain<00:02:19.090> tumors<00:02:19.480> are

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that in fact malignant brain tumors are

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.840 
that in fact malignant brain tumors are
not<00:02:19.810> one<00:02:20.050> disease<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.739> fact<00:02:21.220> they<00:02:21.370> fall<00:02:21.640> into

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
not one disease in fact they fall into

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.080 
not one disease in fact they fall into
various<00:02:22.450> classes<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.410> series<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.370> types<00:02:24.850> of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
various classes or series of types of

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000 
various classes or series of types of
brain<00:02:25.300> tumors<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:26.080> we<00:02:26.260> break<00:02:26.590> apart<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
brain tumors and as we break apart the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.949 
brain tumors and as we break apart the
tumor<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.550> different<00:02:27.880> subtypes<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.720> gain<00:02:28.930> an

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
tumor in a different subtypes we gain an

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.660 
tumor in a different subtypes we gain an
appreciation<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.920> fact<00:02:30.190> there<00:02:30.340> are<00:02:30.370> nuances

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
appreciation in fact there are nuances

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.270 
appreciation in fact there are nuances
or<00:02:31.209> differences<00:02:31.780> from<00:02:32.260> tumor<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.800> tumor<00:02:33.130> that

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
or differences from tumor to tumor that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.250 
or differences from tumor to tumor that
we<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.580> exploit<00:02:33.970> therapeutically<00:02:34.690> today

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
we can exploit therapeutically today

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.110 
we can exploit therapeutically today
this<00:02:35.500> afternoon<00:02:35.709> for<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.550> patient<00:02:36.820> that's

diagnosed with a disease well we know
there's<00:02:39.040> molecular<00:02:39.519> determinants<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.360> why<00:02:40.840> it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
there's molecular determinants of why it

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.720 
there's molecular determinants of why it
