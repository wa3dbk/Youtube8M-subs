thing<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.639> bio<00:02:02.939> Matic<00:02:03.270> products<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
thing about these bio Matic products is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
thing about these bio Matic products is
they've<00:02:04.319> actually<00:02:04.499> been<00:02:04.859> extracted<00:02:05.459> from

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
they've actually been extracted from

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.609 
they've actually been extracted from
live<00:02:05.849> plants<00:02:06.359> these<00:02:06.959> are<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.529> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
live plants these are going to be the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.699 
live plants these are going to be the
most<00:02:07.970> available<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.420> most<00:02:09.599> alive<00:02:09.959> species<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
most available the most alive species of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.760 
most available the most alive species of
mycorrhizae<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> market<00:02:12.000> today<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.560> what

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
mycorrhizae on the market today so what

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
mycorrhizae on the market today so what
makes<00:02:14.040> these<00:02:14.280> different<00:02:14.459> other<00:02:14.910> than<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.239> way

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
makes these different other than the way

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.390 
makes these different other than the way
that<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.690> are<00:02:15.750> extracted<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.069> Glomus

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
that they are extracted so the Glomus

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280 
that they are extracted so the Glomus

this<00:02:46.860> mix<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:48.000> recent<00:02:48.720> research<00:02:49.050> has

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
this mix is because recent research has

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140 
this mix is because recent research has
showed<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.680> Trichoderma<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> micro<00:02:50.970> rise

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
showed that Trichoderma is a micro rise

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.880 
showed that Trichoderma is a micro rise
a<00:02:51.300> species<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.410> little<00:02:52.739> too

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
a species that is a little too

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.220 
a species that is a little too
aggressive<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:54.120> most<00:02:54.360> products<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.080> have

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
aggressive so in most products that have

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.440 
aggressive so in most products that have
trichoderma<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:56.010> them<00:02:56.190> all<00:02:56.640> that's<00:02:56.940> left<00:02:57.239> in

is<00:03:34.440> much<00:03:34.650> more<00:03:34.890> expensive<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.910> many<00:03:36.150> companies

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
is much more expensive so many companies

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.720 
is much more expensive so many companies
leave<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.079> process<00:03:37.530> out<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.040> extract<00:03:38.610> it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
leave that process out and extract it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.880 
leave that process out and extract it
artificially<00:03:39.390> inside<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> lab<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.590> amount

me<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.440> next<00:03:49.590> point<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.100> what<00:03:50.489> exactly<00:03:50.760> is

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
me to the next point of what exactly is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.569 
me to the next point of what exactly is
my<00:03:51.269> carides<00:03:51.570> in<00:03:51.810> mycorrhizae<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> fungal

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
my carides in mycorrhizae is a fungal

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.370 
my carides in mycorrhizae is a fungal
spore<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.360> going<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.600> bond<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.079> roots

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
spore that is going to bond to the roots

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.530 
spore that is going to bond to the roots
so<00:03:55.620> picture<00:03:56.040> roots<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.670> penetrate<00:03:57.239> into<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
so picture roots that penetrate into the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.670 
so picture roots that penetrate into the
edge<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.260> soil

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
edge of the soil

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.789 
edge of the soil
one<00:03:59.190> specifically<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.970> main<00:04:00.420> tap<00:04:00.810> read<00:04:01.109> what

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
one specifically the main tap read what

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.620 
one specifically the main tap read what
the<00:04:01.950> mycorrhizae<00:04:02.310> fungi<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:02.970> going<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.299> do<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the mycorrhizae fungi is going to do is

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.900 
the mycorrhizae fungi is going to do is
it<00:04:03.750> needs<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.989> direct<00:04:04.320> route<00:04:04.500> contact<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.640> when

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
it needs a direct route contact so when

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.630 
it needs a direct route contact so when
it<00:04:06.000> bonds<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.540> those<00:04:06.720> roots<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:08.010> links<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.609> to

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
it bonds to those roots it links up to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.940 
it bonds to those roots it links up to
the<00:04:08.790> root<00:04:09.030> itself<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.810> actually<00:04:10.019> has<00:04:10.920> a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
the root itself and it actually has a

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.830 
the root itself and it actually has a
synergistic<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.030> symbiotic<00:04:12.540> relationship

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
synergistic and a symbiotic relationship

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.620 
synergistic and a symbiotic relationship
with<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.799> what<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.220> mean<00:04:14.489> by<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.269> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
with it what I mean by that is is the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.539 
with it what I mean by that is is the

tablespoons<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.860> cool<00:05:21.100> thing<00:05:21.340> about<00:05:21.460> this<00:05:21.790> is

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
tablespoons the cool thing about this is

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.520 
tablespoons the cool thing about this is
it<00:05:22.150> just<00:05:22.300> need<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.510> direct<00:05:22.840> through<00:05:23.020> contact

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
it just need to direct through contact

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.260 
it just need to direct through contact
so<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.710> always<00:05:24.040> tell<00:05:24.310> people<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.670> sprinkle<00:05:25.180> on

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
so I always tell people to sprinkle on

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.550
