00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
grown by now that is just incredible I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.510 
grown by now that is just incredible I
imagine<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.070> scientifically

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
imagine that this is scientifically

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.790 
imagine that this is scientifically
proven<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.180> certainly<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.900> clinical<00:02:25.470> studies

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
proven it certainly is clinical studies

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
reduced by up to sixty four percent over

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.760 
reduced by up to sixty four percent over
six<00:02:29.850> weeks<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.270> using<00:02:30.480> no<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:30.810> twice<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> week

six weeks of using no no twice a week
start<00:02:32.310> now<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.850> imagine<00:02:33.450> how<00:02:33.570> smooth

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
start now and just imagine how smooth

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.720 
start now and just imagine how smooth
you<00:02:34.080> could<00:02:34.230> look<00:02:34.350> by<00:02:34.530> summer<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> key<00:02:35.580> is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you could look by summer but the key is

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
you could look by summer but the key is
you<00:02:35.880> must<00:02:36.150> use<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.510> at<00:02:36.630> least<00:02:36.870> twice<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.200> week

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
you must use it at least twice a week

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.590 
you must use it at least twice a week
more<00:02:37.710> if<00:02:37.770> possible<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.730> thermicon<00:02:39.270> effect

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
more if possible as the thermicon effect

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.510 
more if possible as the thermicon effect
only<00:02:39.720> works<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.320> very<00:02:40.590> particular<00:02:40.740> phase<00:02:41.280> in

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
only works at a very particular phase in

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.370 
only works at a very particular phase in
the<00:02:41.610> hair<00:02:41.790> growth<00:02:41.970> cycle<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> same<00:02:43.200> with

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the hair growth cycle it's the same with

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.050 
the hair growth cycle it's the same with
laser<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:44.190> why<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.400> need<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.910> more

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
laser that's why you need to have more

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.820 
laser that's why you need to have more
than<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.330> treatment<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.990> course<00:02:46.230> remember<00:02:46.710> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
than one treatment of course remember it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.560 
than one treatment of course remember it
takes<00:02:46.860> dedication<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.970> achieve<00:02:48.240> long-term

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
takes dedication to achieve long-term

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.690 
takes dedication to achieve long-term
results<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.770> happens<00:02:50.070> gradually<00:02:50.280> them

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
results so it happens gradually them

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
results so it happens gradually them

is it even works on the blondest hair
this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.250> such<00:02:59.550> an<00:02:59.700> incredible<00:03:00.300> technology<00:03:00.960> no

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
this is such an incredible technology no

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
this is such an incredible technology no
no<00:03:01.500> not<00:03:01.740> only<00:03:02.040> slows<00:03:02.340> down<00:03:02.550> here<00:03:02.880> regret<00:03:03.210> over

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
no not only slows down here regret over

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.600 
no not only slows down here regret over
time<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.590> helps<00:03:05.160> keep<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.490> from

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
time it actually helps keep it from

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.640 
time it actually helps keep it from
growing<00:03:05.760> back<00:03:06.180> at<00:03:06.570> first<00:03:06.900> four<00:03:07.050> weeks<00:03:07.200> then

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
