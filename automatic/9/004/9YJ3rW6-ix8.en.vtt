00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.689
 we're going to interrupt this chat now to show a report 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.710
 amazing 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.710
 an example of how it is possible 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.919
 inside him 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.519
 the special series report that the good day Brazil is showing this week 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.109
 look that 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.439
 how the locals live 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.999
 of a neighborhood 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.999
 in Japan 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.100
 the train seems out of a fiction movie the lady ministers every increase 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 middle of the barça by means of the buildings besides meters of height the parade is the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.440
 larger and more modern domain 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.840
 an artificial island actually built in Cannes from part of the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 commission 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.190
 for this you need london ninety follows great companies 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.590
 among advantages ahead is a technique of the Statue of Liberty not 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.929
 it's just appearance 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.740
 odair pavesi as the Japanese hope it will be the future efficient 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.670
 I live c 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 will involve an example of coexistence with the garbage 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.939
 practically 100% are reused 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 the Brazilian shoots 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 lived here for two years 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.190
 is that to show here to live in a living society it is necessary to obey 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.860
 some rules for recycling 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.240
 the fall plastics plastic 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.920
 It was all a lie but it usually gives more work. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.630
 In more than ten categories it was difficult to learn all these 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.770
 waste separation 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the beginning it's not much 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.940
 the reason 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.430
 Brazil is accustomed to fears is only you see the game with the benfica 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.020
 after you 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.790
 if I could I would 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.110
 woman having detained six streams and tietê rivers and visa 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.710
 but lost the crown 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.050
 part of the trash that can not be recycled food scraps dirty paper 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.469
 this all raised on Saturday to another room 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.440
 these are the studies that bring the garbage to the siena 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.740
 five pipes coming from the five areas of the island are common 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.450
 vacuum cleaners betting it at 100 miles per hour toward the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.539
 power plant 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.069
 inside but one of the victims is dumped in the house 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.119
 a giant mechanical claw controlled by a command similar to the 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:45.139
 video game collects everything throw out of the area the heat generated and electricity 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.199
 everything works automatically 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:53.039
 the engineers journey from July to the case of some panic no grain of 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.339
 dirt is wasted 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:59.499
 but these findings are reused for example to 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.519
 pave the streets 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.099
 the hunger strike requiring it explains that probably the air expelled by the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.200
 intestine is more important than breathing in tokyo 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.739
 by late afternoon 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.989
 the energy produced from the waste 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.489
 supplied up to 10,000 homes 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 and one of the customers this sports gym that to match the style 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.499
 of the neighborhood looks like a spaceship 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:28.879
 the sports center swimming pools are used by residents of the neighborhood and paid 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.340
 a very low rate six reais 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.870
 to swim here for two hours and water is always bite kept at 30 degrees 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 thanks also negotiates the coming of the garbage plant even in the winter no one here 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.449
 need to face the cold water 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.539
 residents enjoy the benefits of living in the neighborhood that is one of the most 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:53.689
 of the world for the rest of japan is not so, but neither is it. 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.219
 it is very different 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.969
 the rules of separation of garbage vary from neighborhood to neighborhood some fine to 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.089
 who do not obey 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:05.499
 but what makes the Japanese so careful is the 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:10.840
 they began to separate the garbage to 500 years is a tradition learned in the 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.729
 school and with the family 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.620
 japan there are no dumps on the sidewalks if you want to get rid of a 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.579
 bottle of soda or tea 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.169
 need to turn a convenience store where there is a collection point for 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.849
 recycling the trash here 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.510
 is divided into four categories there we make it so first 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.529
 goes to the drain and rams 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:30.979
 the rest of the liquid 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.810
 the bottle 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.050
 It has to be empty. 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.150
 we'll plant the face later 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.159
 in this classic here 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.159
 you do the government will also expand 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.479
 We can throw the bottle. 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.809
 the dagobert 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:51.519
 give clear work that gives the prize he lived in cities that will be installed 

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.759
 on rainy days and with ov 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.400
 You look like unemployment has just been through a good cleanup.
