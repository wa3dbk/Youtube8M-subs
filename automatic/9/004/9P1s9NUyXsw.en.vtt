00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
o'clock and it's beer time so let's see

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.020 
o'clock and it's beer time so let's see
what<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.470> got<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.649> on

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.250 

sweet<00:02:10.600> corn<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.670> thin<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.840> tortilla

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
sweet corn really thin like tortilla

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.770 
sweet corn really thin like tortilla
chip<00:02:14.530> level<00:02:14.709> corn<00:02:15.280> Courtney's<00:02:15.970> weakness<00:02:16.630> at

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
chip level corn Courtney's weakness at

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.380 
chip level corn Courtney's weakness at
this<00:02:16.900> one<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.860> does<00:02:21.160> taste<00:02:21.400> better<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.819> think<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
this one it does taste better I think a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.420 
this one it does taste better I think a
little<00:02:22.540> bit<00:02:22.660> than<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> one<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.010> bottom<00:02:24.220> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
little bit than the one in the bottom of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.190 
little bit than the one in the bottom of
the<00:02:24.670> bottle<00:02:24.940> sometimes<00:02:25.300> feels<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> little<00:02:26.020> bit

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
the bottle sometimes feels a little bit

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.830 
the bottle sometimes feels a little bit
thicker<00:02:26.500> than<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.860> one<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.130> maybe<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.840> wife

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
thicker than this one so maybe the wife

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.420 
thicker than this one so maybe the wife
isn't<00:02:29.200> too<00:02:29.319> awful<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:29.830> one<00:02:29.980> also<00:02:30.130> this

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
isn't too awful in this one also this

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
isn't too awful in this one also this
one's<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.760> skunked<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.450> not<00:02:31.540> totally

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
one's not skunked so it's not totally

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.520 
one's not skunked so it's not totally

revolting at the macro loggers I've had
down<00:02:35.800> here<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:36.790> Corona<00:02:37.239> in<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
down here I like this Corona in the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.410 
down here I like this Corona in the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
I've drank enough for me I'll review

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.310 
I've drank enough for me I'll review
them<00:02:44.620> all<00:02:44.739> but<00:02:44.890> I'll<00:02:44.980> get<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.340> them<00:02:46.320> they're

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
them all but I'll get to them they're

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.479 
them all but I'll get to them they're
better<00:02:47.560> than<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:49.330> guess<00:02:50.200> one<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.950> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
better than this one I guess one of a to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.470 
better than this one I guess one of a to
be<00:02:51.610> scalable<00:02:52.360> I'll<00:02:53.310> I'll<00:02:54.310> kind<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:54.970> curve<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.420> a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
be scalable I'll I'll kind of curve it a

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.790 
be scalable I'll I'll kind of curve it a
little<00:02:55.660> bit<00:02:55.840> since<00:02:56.110> we're<00:02:56.319> down<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.650> heat

little bit since we're down in the heat
and<00:02:57.069> macro<00:02:57.580> loggers<00:02:57.970> are<00:02:58.120> good<00:02:58.269> for<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> heat

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and macro loggers are good for the heat

and macro loggers are good for the heat
I'm<00:03:00.130> gonna<00:03:00.310> give<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.610> one<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:01.269> see<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:03.010> other
