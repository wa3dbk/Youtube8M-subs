them I think I'm gonna go for a PC first
and<00:03:37.489> then<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:38.090> Xbox<00:03:38.750> one<00:03:39.079> after<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.680> sometime

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
and then a Xbox one after that sometime

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.770 
and then a Xbox one after that sometime
but<00:03:41.870> that's<00:03:42.620> just<00:03:42.919> I<00:03:43.250> mean<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:44.090> really<00:03:44.239> depends

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
but that's just I mean it really depends

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.110 
but that's just I mean it really depends
if<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.109> lot<00:03:45.319> of<00:03:45.440> subs<00:03:45.799> have<00:03:46.069> Xbox<00:03:46.459> one<00:03:46.819> there's<00:03:47.060> a

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
if a lot of subs have Xbox one there's a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.640 
if a lot of subs have Xbox one there's a
lot<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.389> factors<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:47.840> would<00:03:48.109> go<00:03:48.260> into<00:03:48.440> the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
lot of factors that would go into the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.009 
lot of factors that would go into the
decision<00:03:48.980> but<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.579> think<00:03:49.669> my<00:03:50.060> stream<00:03:50.419> quality

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
decision but I think my stream quality

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.629 
decision but I think my stream quality
is<00:03:51.199> the<00:03:51.379> number<00:03:51.650> one<00:03:51.829> priority<00:03:52.099> right<00:03:52.400> now

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
is the number one priority right now

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.670 
is the number one priority right now
because<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.120> guys<00:03:53.239> deserve<00:03:53.750> better<00:03:54.500> than

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
because you guys deserve better than
