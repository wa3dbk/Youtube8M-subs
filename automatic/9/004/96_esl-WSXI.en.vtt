 pleasure it does not matter to me it goes up more 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.450
 the faster we really have a good 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.800
 rate of subscribers and it's great 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.440

 special it better the touch play jets 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.200
 that's the good thing and that's how 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.310
 you may have seen it in the 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.290
 title it's a little contest or a 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.920
 little contest to win the game of 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.930
 your choice 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.700
 here we go, we'll do a few things 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.310
 precisions did not sell right away 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.590
 it's a recent game this is a recent game 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.540
 who stepped out like battlefield 4 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.159
 is ordered a no it's a 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.619
 game that is available in store 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.689
 not on the internet that we order 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.340
 available in store not a pack kind 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.290
 monster hunter sorting ultimate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.990
 what a not boxing with a game no 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.110
 This is a simple game and boxer 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.980
 battle beating sees the little box 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.800
 so a game that is in store 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.690
 easily found in a good store 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.350
 this is the price we do not care but that's good 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.659
 goes from 70 euros on average i think pc 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.190
 deigned to 3ds 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.600
 the important thing in the banks exit n 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.220
 any medium but a game that is 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.479
 puts in front of a relay shop for that he 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 there is a special condition enough we do not 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.240
 do not know the contests e mail shares 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.940
 from here such comments 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.960
 here I wait no it would be too much 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.120
 simple it would be too simple 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.320
 so as if you know a little 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.880
 how little you have yours that's true 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.530
 that we often have delusions even if for 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.240
 the moment it is a little calmed on her on 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.830
 billy and a billy a staff 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.200

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.880
 invented that with the mates and actually 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.049
 to win this game of your choice want 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.520
 you will have to create a small 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.189
 story with as main character 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.569
 purpose but as no one principle the 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.099
 main character will be named billy 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.180

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.010
 chain since there something 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.420

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 always obvious at first 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.690
 how we send a message is actually 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.100
 you see that's all that nurtures the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.600

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.840
 and if you are a winner it would be 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.549
 pity these areas and it's already me 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.200
 happened only when we send a message and 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.030

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.230

 but good moment it's gone 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.600
 because afterwards if we do all the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.740
 1000 good already it's me we do not even know 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.660
 what are we going to do to go 10 cities 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.940
 panting to the art but here you go 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:27.720
 still five thousand general subscribers the 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:28.620
 micro swing month so when that's going 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.220
 go on a ball so that's the moment 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.570
 to stop 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.950
 so here's anyway thank you really 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.400
 for the 5000 subscribers it's great 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.840
 pleasure 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.720
 I will not leave you what I have you 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.160
 and meant exactly the same 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.680
 we clean up twins for nothing so here we go 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.150
 it's really fun 5000 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.419
 people me it's really huge 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.250
 if we had said one day that we are interested 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.120
 that's really going to go into 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.180
 intimate confessions 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.430
 it really changed my life 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.230
 so be sure it's true in power 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.270
 face to bring new experiences 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.540
 that we can not really have to 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.230
 normal is ten years pupil to the king on 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.669
 is going pretty good everywhere but it's true that 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.250
 it brings a new experience and 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.850
 that I think he knows it's really 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.200
 something that individuals 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.480
 I do not want to do that changed our life 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.010
 completely like that but it brings 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.230
 a few more to our well typed 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.540
