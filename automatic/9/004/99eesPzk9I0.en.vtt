it says w1 people wanna I can tell you
this<00:00:49.880> isn't<00:00:50.180> exactly<00:00:51.640> same<00:00:52.640> size<00:00:53.830> as<00:00:54.830> the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
this isn't exactly same size as the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.280 
this isn't exactly same size as the
blade<00:00:55.489> mqx<00:00:56.210> looks<00:00:57.140> like<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.960> this<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.020> the

blade mqx looks like and this is the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.810 
blade mqx looks like and this is the
transmitter<00:01:01.210> 2.4<00:01:02.210> gigahertz<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:04.430> it's<00:01:04.640> got

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
transmitter 2.4 gigahertz so it's got

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.350 
transmitter 2.4 gigahertz so it's got

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
your half rate switch and what this does

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.710 
your half rate switch and what this does
there's<00:01:58.610> 40%

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
there's 40%

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.100 
there's 40%
push<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.770> again<00:02:00.830> 60<00:02:01.660> again<00:02:03.490> 120%<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:05.690> these<00:02:05.869> are

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
push it again 60 again 120% so these are

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
that is a low high speed roll huh let's

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.150 
that is a low high speed roll huh let's
try<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.879> again

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:14.700 

Bobby<00:04:00.880> giving<00:04:01.210> it<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.450> try<00:04:01.600> here

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.100 

I'm<00:04:15.710> going<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.010> flip<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> switch<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.850> hive

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
I'm going to flip the switch to hive

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:38.439 
I'm going to flip the switch to hive
only<00:04:18.110> do<00:04:18.260> one<00:04:18.500> rule<00:04:18.769> at<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.040> time

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.659 

you<00:04:39.050> know<00:04:39.199> I<00:04:39.229> also<00:04:39.499> like<00:04:39.919> that<00:04:39.949> each<00:04:40.249> trim

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
you know I also like that each trim

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.670 
you know I also like that each trim
switch<00:04:40.969> lights<00:04:41.300> up<00:04:41.569> so<00:04:41.599> you<00:04:41.870> can<00:04:42.139> see<00:04:42.379> it<00:04:42.529> and

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
switch lights up so you can see it and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.100 
switch lights up so you can see it and
also<00:04:43.249> when<00:04:43.610> it's<00:04:43.789> 100<00:04:44.240> percent<00:04:44.569> mode<00:04:44.809> all

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
also when it's 100 percent mode all

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.320 
also when it's 100 percent mode all
colors<00:04:45.529> changed<00:04:46.069> from<00:04:46.249> blue<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.759> orange<00:04:46.789> and

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
colors changed from blue to orange and

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.820 
colors changed from blue to orange and
that<00:04:47.419> instantly<00:04:48.080> tells<00:04:48.349> you<00:04:48.439> where<00:04:48.650> your

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
that instantly tells you where your

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.610 
that instantly tells you where your
added<00:04:49.159> at<00:04:49.249> a<00:04:49.309> glance<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:50.169> know<00:04:51.169> also<00:04:51.289> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
added at a glance you know also the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.890 
added at a glance you know also the
beetle<00:04:51.919> only<00:04:52.219> allows<00:04:52.520> one<00:04:52.550> flip<00:04:53.389> every<00:04:53.659> 4

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
beetle only allows one flip every 4

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.469 
beetle only allows one flip every 4
seconds<00:04:54.409> that<00:04:54.889> saves<00:04:55.189> you<00:04:55.370> from<00:04:55.580> continually

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
seconds that saves you from continually

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.969 
seconds that saves you from continually
rolling<00:04:56.900> right<00:04:57.110> into<00:04:57.409> the<00:04:57.529> ground<00:04:57.800> and

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
rolling right into the ground and

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.249 
rolling right into the ground and
crashing<00:04:58.460> that's<00:04:59.089> a<00:04:59.270> pretty<00:04:59.479> good<00:04:59.659> idea

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
crashing that's a pretty good idea

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.829 
crashing that's a pretty good idea
well<00:05:01.189> actually<00:05:01.339> the<00:05:01.669> only<00:05:01.819> mod<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.419> I<00:05:02.449> did

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:02.839 
well actually the only mod that I did

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.869 
well actually the only mod that I did
that<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.139> think<00:05:03.289> is<00:05:03.620> important<00:05:04.219> is<00:05:04.339> to<00:05:04.490> add<00:05:04.610> the

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
that I think is important is to add the

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.850 
that I think is important is to add the
lighted<00:05:05.270> stinger<00:05:05.749> that<00:05:06.169> way<00:05:06.319> I<00:05:06.349> can<00:05:06.589> see<00:05:06.770> it

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
lighted stinger that way I can see it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.610 
lighted stinger that way I can see it
better<00:05:07.009> and<00:05:07.219> still<00:05:07.699> stay<00:05:07.939> oriented<00:05:08.360> I<00:05:08.779> used<00:05:09.439> a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
better and still stay oriented I used a

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.429 
better and still stay oriented I used a
three<00:05:09.860> point<00:05:10.129> seven<00:05:10.400> volt<00:05:10.610> blue<00:05:11.150> LED<00:05:11.719> and<00:05:12.020> I

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
three point seven volt blue LED and I

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.529 
three point seven volt blue LED and I
soldered<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.069> to<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.460> board<00:05:13.669> on<00:05:13.909> the<00:05:14.060> plus<00:05:14.300> and

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
soldered it to the board on the plus and

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.629 
soldered it to the board on the plus and
minus<00:05:14.839> terminals<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.620> then<00:05:16.099> used<00:05:16.339> the<00:05:16.490> heat

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
minus terminals and then used the heat

00:05:16.639 --> 00:07:38.600 
minus terminals and then used the heat
shrink<00:05:16.879> as<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.509> guide<00:05:17.749> as<00:05:18.020> shown
