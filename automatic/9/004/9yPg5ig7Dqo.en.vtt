that's<00:01:41.250> how<00:01:41.400> big<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.030> phone<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that's how big this phone is a lot of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.380 
that's how big this phone is a lot of
people<00:01:43.829> say<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.520> size<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.149> phone

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
people say this the size of this phone

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.889 
people say this the size of this phone
is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:46.020> downfall<00:01:46.700> from<00:01:47.700> Nia<00:01:47.939> first<00:01:48.299> alias<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is a downfall from Nia first alias but I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
is a downfall from Nia first alias but I
think<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.950> makes<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> little

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
think it's actually makes it a little

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760 
think it's actually makes it a little
more<00:01:50.880> comfortable<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:52.049> they<00:01:52.290> did<00:01:52.470> round

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
more comfortable because they did round

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.819 
more comfortable because they did round
the<00:01:52.950> edges<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> original<00:01:54.090> alias<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.869> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the edges in the original alias and it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.450 
the edges in the original alias and it
just<00:01:56.040> makes<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.520> four<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.899> because<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.890> first

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
just makes it four so because the first

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.850 
just makes it four so because the first
alias<00:01:59.939> crammed<00:02:00.479> buttons<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.439> way<00:02:01.619> in

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
alias crammed buttons all the way in

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.660 
alias crammed buttons all the way in
here<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:02.850> rounded<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.549> part<00:02:05.549> right

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
here so they rounded this part right

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
here so they rounded this part right
here<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.570> spaced<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.680> made<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
here and they spaced out and made the a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.830 
here and they spaced out and made the a
keyboard<00:02:08.789> longer<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.780> also<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> buttons<00:02:10.470> way

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
keyboard longer and also the buttons way

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.470 
keyboard longer and also the buttons way
by<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.800> way<00:02:11.980> both<00:02:12.250> keyboards<00:02:12.940> pretty<00:02:13.300> much

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
by the way both keyboards pretty much

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.030 
by the way both keyboards pretty much

phone is almost as good as everybody
says<00:03:43.660> only<00:03:44.290> bad<00:03:44.709> thing<00:03:44.950> about<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.280> phone<00:03:45.489> is

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
says only bad thing about this phone is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.430 
says only bad thing about this phone is
the<00:03:45.880> camera<00:03:46.780> it's<00:03:47.500> not<00:03:47.769> as<00:03:47.980> good<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:49.359> LG<00:03:50.049> m3

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
the camera it's not as good that LG m3

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.559 
the camera it's not as good that LG m3
the<00:03:50.650> flash<00:03:50.950> is<00:03:51.250> useful<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:51.970> sometimes<00:03:52.389> it

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
the flash is useful but sometimes it

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.220 
the flash is useful but sometimes it
makes<00:03:52.720> white<00:03:53.380> objects<00:03:54.010> up<00:03:54.819> here<00:03:55.209> even<00:03:55.750> whiter

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
makes white objects up here even whiter

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.190 
makes white objects up here even whiter
and<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:58.060> cool<00:03:58.299> thing<00:03:58.450> about<00:03:58.540> this<00:03:58.900> camera

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
and the cool thing about this camera

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.309 
and the cool thing about this camera
feature<00:03:59.590> is<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:01.209> brightness<00:04:01.690> adjustment<00:04:02.079> and

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
feature is the brightness adjustment and

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.099 
feature is the brightness adjustment and
also<00:04:02.560> has<00:04:02.859> good<00:04:03.069> zooms<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.079> a

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
also has good zooms it just this is a

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.080 
also has good zooms it just this is a
3.0<00:04:06.040> megapixel<00:04:07.030> camera<00:04:07.389> and<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.010> 2.0

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
3.0 megapixel camera and this is a 2.0

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.559 
3.0 megapixel camera and this is a 2.0
so<00:04:10.090> that's<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.450> drawback<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:11.980> all<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:13.090> all<00:04:13.389> of

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
so that's the drawback but all of all of

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.720 
so that's the drawback but all of all of
them<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.959> would<00:04:14.470> definitely<00:04:15.100> choose<00:04:15.370> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
them I would definitely choose the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.440 
them I would definitely choose the
ugliest<00:04:16.180> -<00:04:16.389> for<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.750> good<00:04:16.989> texting<00:04:17.500> phone<00:04:17.709> and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
ugliest - for a good texting phone and

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.449 
ugliest - for a good texting phone and
I'm<00:04:19.450> not<00:04:19.870> letting<00:04:20.200> this<00:04:20.320> I'm<00:04:21.010> just<00:04:21.340> telling

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
I'm not letting this I'm just telling

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.310 
I'm not letting this I'm just telling
the<00:04:21.880> story<00:04:22.150> because<00:04:22.539> this<00:04:22.720> affected<00:04:23.200> my

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320
