fans to give them a great fight and
because<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.070> Gennady<00:01:26.460> works<00:01:26.759> like

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
because of that if Gennady works like

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.539 
because of that if Gennady works like
he's<00:01:27.180> he's<00:01:27.570> supposed<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.220> Monroe<00:01:29.220> should<00:01:29.430> not

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
he's he's supposed to Monroe should not

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
he's he's supposed to Monroe should not
go<00:01:29.700> 12<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.960> Monroe<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.590> good<00:01:31.650> fighter

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
go 12 but Monroe is a very good fighter

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490 
go 12 but Monroe is a very good fighter
but<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> said<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> past<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> nobody<00:01:33.930> 160

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
but I said in the past that nobody 160

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
but I said in the past that nobody 160
pounds<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.130> 12<00:01:35.700> rounds<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:35.970> Gennady<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
pounds can go 12 rounds with Gennady and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.190 
pounds can go 12 rounds with Gennady and
I<00:01:36.810> believe<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> still<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:38.430> Gennady

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
I believe that still if Gennady

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
I believe that still if Gennady
continues<00:01:40.200> his<00:01:40.860> approach<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> ring<00:01:42.119> as

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
continues his approach in the ring as

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
continues his approach in the ring as
he's<00:01:42.630> been<00:01:42.810> doing<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.920> should<00:01:44.100> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
170 so big the reason that were the way

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.480 
170 so big the reason that were the way
that<00:02:23.790> he<00:02:23.850> loses<00:02:24.210> weight<00:02:24.620> going<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.740> coming<00:02:26.400> in

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.220 
that he loses weight going to coming in
camp<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.120> he<00:02:27.240> starts<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.690> watch<00:02:27.960> what<00:02:28.170> he

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
camp is that he starts to watch what he

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.310

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
that I think that if we get into 216 and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.680 
that I think that if we get into 216 and
we're<00:03:32.700> still<00:03:32.880> not<00:03:32.970> getting<00:03:33.030> those<00:03:33.299> fights<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
we're still not getting those fights it

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
hope that weren't in the kind of

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.050 
hope that weren't in the kind of
that<00:04:37.740> were<00:04:38.009> supposed<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.400> be<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:38.759> he<00:04:38.849> can

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
that were supposed to be so that he can

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
absorb some of the punches but I think

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.689 
absorb some of the punches but I think
that<00:04:41.909> because<00:04:42.389> of<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:43.650> style<00:04:44.009> is<00:04:44.279> why<00:04:44.490> we're

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699

super champion we get one optional fight
and<00:05:21.509> they<00:05:21.659> need<00:05:21.839> at<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.139> fight<00:05:22.319> Gennady<00:05:22.789> for

and they need at the fight Gennady for
the<00:05:23.849> belt<00:05:24.029> that<00:05:24.839> would<00:05:25.020> be<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.199> fight<00:05:25.529> that<00:05:25.740> I

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
the belt that would be the fight that I

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.249 
the belt that would be the fight that I
think<00:05:26.339> the<00:05:27.089> public<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.449> clamoring<00:05:27.659> for<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.229> I

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
think the public is clamoring for and I

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.719 
think the public is clamoring for and I
think<00:05:28.439> it'd<00:05:28.529> be<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.650> great<00:05:28.889> big<00:05:29.279> fight<00:05:29.460> here<00:05:29.639> in

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
think it'd be a great big fight here in

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.070 
think it'd be a great big fight here in
New<00:05:29.789> York<00:05:30.029> I<00:05:30.180> think<00:05:30.360> it's<00:05:30.509> probably<00:05:30.689> bigger

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
New York I think it's probably bigger

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.219 
New York I think it's probably bigger
than<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.409> garden<00:05:32.689> but<00:05:33.689> that<00:05:33.900> would<00:05:34.020> be<00:05:34.110> the

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
than the garden but that would be the

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.290 
than the garden but that would be the
fights<00:05:34.469> I<00:05:34.589> think<00:05:34.800> that<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:35.370> cap<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.789> year<00:05:36.089> and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
fights I think that to cap the year and

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.240 
fights I think that to cap the year and
if<00:05:36.629> that<00:05:36.839> was<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.199> fight<00:05:37.379> I<00:05:37.589> don't<00:05:37.889> think<00:05:37.949> that

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
if that was the fight I don't think that

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.529 
if that was the fight I don't think that
we'd<00:05:38.370> fight<00:05:38.580> four<00:05:38.789> times<00:05:39.000> I<00:05:39.149> think<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.449> we

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
we'd fight four times I think that we

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.730 
we'd fight four times I think that we
fight<00:05:39.750> that<00:05:39.960> would<00:05:40.050> be<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.229> last<00:05:40.379> fight<00:05:40.620> of

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
fight that would be the last fight of

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.889 
fight that would be the last fight of
the<00:05:40.800> year<00:05:40.830> thank<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:41.729> avil<00:05:42.000> radio<00:05:42.599> right<00:05:42.839> here
