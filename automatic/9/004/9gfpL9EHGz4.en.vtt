00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
day in and day out but as you can see

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.110 
day in and day out but as you can see
overall<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:08.950> looks<00:04:09.099> pretty<00:04:09.340> good<00:04:09.489> for<00:04:09.819> daily

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
overall it looks pretty good for daily

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.900 
overall it looks pretty good for daily
wear<00:04:10.359> for<00:04:10.660> four<00:04:10.870> years<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:12.250> if<00:04:12.430> you're<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.609> fan

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
wear for four years and if you're a fan

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.050 
wear for four years and if you're a fan
of<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.090> monogram<00:04:13.510> canvas<00:04:14.130> which<00:04:15.130> obviously<00:04:16.030> I

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
of the monogram canvas which obviously I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.509 
of the monogram canvas which obviously I
am<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.419> picked<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.750> up<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.769> shows<00:04:18.160> pretty

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
am I picked this up it shows pretty

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.949 
am I picked this up it shows pretty
nicely<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.150> way<00:04:19.239> they'd<00:04:19.450> balance<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.900> I

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
nicely the way they'd balance that I

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.569 
nicely the way they'd balance that I
like<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.289> fact<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.680> got<00:04:20.829> 1<00:04:20.979> lb<00:04:21.280> on<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
like the fact that it's got 1 lb on the

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.310 
like the fact that it's got 1 lb on the
front<00:04:21.849> it's<00:04:22.479> got<00:04:22.660> one<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> middle<00:04:23.229> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
front it's got one in the middle and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.659 
front it's got one in the middle and
then<00:04:23.410> one<00:04:23.590> on<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.770> back<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:24.190> think<00:04:24.520> that

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
then one on the back I just think that

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.050 
then one on the back I just think that
that's<00:04:24.849> got<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> nice<00:04:25.539> symmetry<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:26.289> it<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:27.130> if

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
that's got a nice symmetry to it so if

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.800 
that's got a nice symmetry to it so if
you're<00:04:28.240> in<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.360> market<00:04:28.690> for<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:29.110> Louis<00:04:29.380> Vuitton

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
you're in the market for a Louis Vuitton

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.629 
you're in the market for a Louis Vuitton
and<00:04:30.410> they<00:04:30.530> range<00:04:30.740> from<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:31.130> three<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.400> five

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
and they range from a three to five

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.850 
and they range from a three to five
hundred<00:04:31.670> dollars<00:04:32.240> as<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.560> see<00:04:33.680> if<00:04:33.770> you

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
hundred dollars as you can see if you

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.379 
hundred dollars as you can see if you
take<00:04:34.070> care<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.730> I<00:04:34.850> take<00:04:35.090> very<00:04:35.210> good

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
take care of it and I take very good

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.879 
take care of it and I take very good
care<00:04:35.450> of<00:04:35.600> my<00:04:35.720> wallet<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.139> always<00:04:36.470> keep<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.770> in<00:04:36.800> my

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
care of my wallet I always keep it in my

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.750 
care of my wallet I always keep it in my
front<00:04:37.070> pocket<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:38.090> holds<00:04:38.330> up<00:04:38.480> pretty<00:04:38.720> well<00:04:39.760> but

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
front pocket it holds up pretty well but

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.010 
front pocket it holds up pretty well but
again<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.600> wall<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:41.870> you're

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020
