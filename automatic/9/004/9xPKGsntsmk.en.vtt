in this map guys you do a wheelie on it
sometimes<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.960> think<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.170> do<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> second

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920

lap<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.250> keep<00:02:10.399> an<00:02:10.490> eye<00:02:10.550> out<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.840> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
lap so keep an eye out for that so I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.060 
lap so keep an eye out for that so I
believe<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.230> monkey<00:02:12.620> out<00:02:12.710> here<00:02:12.890> taking

believe this is monkey out here taking
the<00:02:13.310> outside<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.940> think<00:02:14.510> he<00:02:14.600> wanted<00:02:14.900> me<00:02:15.020> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
the outside I think he wanted me to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.140 
the outside I think he wanted me to
catch<00:02:15.530> up<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.800> get<00:02:15.950> more<00:02:16.160> competition<00:02:16.580> range

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
catch up and get more competition range

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.460

this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> job<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.020> was<00:02:37.110> talking<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.410> with

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
this is the job I was talking about with

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.040 
this is the job I was talking about with
the<00:02:37.800> wheelie<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.720> guys<00:02:39.870> like

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the wheelie and I know you guys like

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.330 
the wheelie and I know you guys like
that<00:02:40.260> song<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.770> felt<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.220> was<00:02:41.310> very

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that song I felt that was very

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.650 
that song I felt that was very
appropriate<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.090> part

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
appropriate for that part

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.020 
appropriate for that part
so<00:02:43.200> yeah<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.860> literally<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.280> freefall<00:02:44.670> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
so yeah it's literally a freefall you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.420 
so yeah it's literally a freefall you
it's<00:02:45.600> not<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> jump<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.620> you're<00:02:46.950> falling

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it's not like a jump it's you're falling

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's not like a jump it's you're falling
because<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.210> jump<00:02:48.450> goes<00:02:48.600> down<00:02:48.920> you're

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
because the jump goes down you're

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.100 
because the jump goes down you're
finally<00:02:50.130> calming<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.550> wrong<00:02:51.420> keep<00:02:51.750> him<00:02:51.960> still
