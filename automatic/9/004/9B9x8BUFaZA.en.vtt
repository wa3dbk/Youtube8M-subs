00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
round bass string which was kind of

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.830 
round bass string which was kind of
pretty<00:02:59.049> pioneering<00:02:59.680> because<00:03:00.250> John<00:03:00.609> Entwistle

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
pretty pioneering because John Entwistle

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.920 
pretty pioneering because John Entwistle
saw<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.079> liked<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.709> used<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.930> suddenly

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
saw it liked it and used it and suddenly

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.379 
saw it liked it and used it and suddenly
the<00:03:05.049> bass<00:03:05.200> guitar<00:03:05.650> was<00:03:05.859> all<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.090> year

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
the bass guitar was all to the year

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.590 
the bass guitar was all to the year
before

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.480 

well<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.630> would<00:03:11.840> say<00:03:12.110> motor<00:03:12.800> sound<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:13.400> of

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
well I would say motor sound is one of

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.380 
well I would say motor sound is one of
the<00:03:13.580> top<00:03:13.900> whose<00:03:14.900> most<00:03:15.110> famous<00:03:15.230> stream<00:03:15.830> Lakers

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the top whose most famous stream Lakers

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.810 
the top whose most famous stream Lakers
primarily<00:03:17.390> because<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.900> our<00:03:18.020> heritage<00:03:18.920> and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
primarily because of our heritage and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.280 
primarily because of our heritage and
our<00:03:19.940> history<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.860> have<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.910> say<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.720> lot

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
our history and I have to say this a lot

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.350 
our history and I have to say this a lot
but<00:03:24.800> we<00:03:25.070> actually<00:03:25.220> make<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.700> at<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> Museum

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
but we actually make it at the Museum

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.070 
but we actually make it at the Museum
and<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:27.760> think<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.850> this<00:03:28.970> market<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.720> is

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
and I think in this market that that is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.380 
and I think in this market that that is
important<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:31.100> we<00:03:31.250> actually<00:03:31.390> manufacture

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
important that we actually manufacture

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.650 
important that we actually manufacture
what<00:03:33.200> we<00:03:33.350> sell<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.860> promote<00:03:34.220> because<00:03:34.520> we<00:03:34.910> we

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
what we sell we promote because we we

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.410 
what we sell we promote because we we
know<00:03:35.840> about<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.260> product<00:03:36.680> right<00:03:37.160> from<00:03:37.520> the

know about the product right from the

it<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.690> know<00:03:41.840> even<00:03:42.620> down<00:03:42.800> to<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.010> machinery

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
it you know even down to the machinery

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.199 
it you know even down to the machinery
which<00:03:44.240> we<00:03:44.480> designed<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.410> make<00:03:45.590> sure<00:03:45.620> that

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
which we designed so we make sure that

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.030 
which we designed so we make sure that
my<00:03:47.209> dad's<00:03:47.450> old<00:03:47.720> machines<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.500> 60s<00:03:48.920> were

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
my dad's old machines in the 60s were

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.030 
my dad's old machines in the 60s were
made<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> certain<00:03:49.550> way<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:51.350> kind<00:03:51.980> of

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
made a certain way and I kind of

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.400 
made a certain way and I kind of
replicated<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:53.030> lot<00:03:53.360> of<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.600> inherent

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
replicated a lot of the inherent

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.190 
replicated a lot of the inherent
characteristics<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.550> those<00:03:55.670> machines<00:03:56.200> with

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
characteristics of those machines with

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
characteristics of those machines with
our<00:03:57.380> new<00:03:57.620> machines<00:03:57.980> but<00:03:58.400> with<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.610> lot<00:03:58.760> more

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
our new machines but with a lot more

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.930 
our new machines but with a lot more
automation<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.170> computer<00:04:00.500> control<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.640> I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
automation and computer control so I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.860 
automation and computer control so I
think<00:04:02.660> great<00:04:03.080> heritage<00:04:04.300> longevity<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.600> fact

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
think great heritage longevity the fact

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.600 
think great heritage longevity the fact
that<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.140> company's<00:04:06.500> been<00:04:06.680> around<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.340> been

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
that the company's been around and been

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.050 
that the company's been around and been
through<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.840> lot<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.740> great<00:04:10.010> areas<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.640> music

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.990
