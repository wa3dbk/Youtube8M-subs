calorie calibration stuff should be

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.780 
calorie calibration stuff should be
better<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:28.010> don't<00:04:29.010> really<00:04:29.190> sure<00:04:29.340> how<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.580> do

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
bug of that in 7th open to another fix

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.090 
bug of that in 7th open to another fix
two<00:05:05.550> very<00:05:06.030> very<00:05:06.210> quick<00:05:06.630> here<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.170> reduce

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
two very very quick here and reduce

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.410 
two very very quick here and reduce
motion<00:05:08.370> if<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:08.880> don't<00:05:09.030> like<00:05:09.210> motion

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
motion if you don't like motion

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.930 
motion if you don't like motion
then<00:05:11.020> they<00:05:11.290> have<00:05:11.650> like<00:05:12.070> demotion<00:05:12.520> like<00:05:12.550> when<00:05:12.910> I

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
then they have like demotion like when I

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.920 
then they have like demotion like when I
go<00:05:13.120> in<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.390> out<00:05:13.510> of<00:05:13.540> apps<00:05:14.670> and<00:05:15.670> now<00:05:16.570> they<00:05:16.720> made

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
go in and out of apps and now they made

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.880 
go in and out of apps and now they made
it<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:17.440> if<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:17.890> go<00:05:18.130> into<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:20.440> sea<00:05:20.590> here<00:05:20.740> if<00:05:20.800> you

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
it so if you go into the sea here if you

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.650 
it so if you go into the sea here if you
go<00:05:20.980> into<00:05:21.130> general<00:05:21.550> accessibility<00:05:22.120> if<00:05:22.570> you

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
go into general accessibility if you

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.330 
go into general accessibility if you
don't<00:05:22.810> want<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:22.990> see<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.740> stuff<00:05:24.070> and

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
don't want to see that that stuff and

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.520 
don't want to see that that stuff and
they<00:05:25.120> made<00:05:25.360> reduce<00:05:25.720> motion<00:05:25.930> even<00:05:26.380> better

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
they made reduce motion even better

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.860 
they made reduce motion even better
because<00:05:27.310> now<00:05:27.460> you<00:05:27.640> only<00:05:27.910> get<00:05:28.120> like<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.330> fadeaway

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
because now you only get like a fadeaway

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.040 
because now you only get like a fadeaway
effect<00:05:29.380> when<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:29.860> open<00:05:30.280> stuff<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.300> clothes

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
effect when you open stuff and clothes

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.140 
effect when you open stuff and clothes
stuffs<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.670> can<00:05:33.820> see<00:05:34.000> here<00:05:36.030> it's<00:05:37.030> a

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
stuffs so you can see here it's a

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.630 
stuffs so you can see here it's a
fadeaway<00:05:37.540> effects<00:05:38.110> pretty<00:05:38.620> pretty<00:05:38.980> good

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
fadeaway effects pretty pretty good

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.580 
fadeaway effects pretty pretty good
there<00:05:40.030> if<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.510> like<00:05:40.660> that<00:05:40.930> or<00:05:41.200> if<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:41.500> don't

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
want to see that a parallax effect also

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.440 
want to see that a parallax effect also
like<00:05:44.200> on<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.410> desktop<00:05:44.760> icons<00:05:45.760> moving<00:05:46.150> stuff

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
like on the desktop icons moving stuff

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
this enable reduce motion and enjoy it

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.580 
this enable reduce motion and enjoy it
voiceover<00:06:01.690> it<00:06:01.870> should<00:06:02.050> affect<00:06:02.170> some<00:06:02.440> stuff

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
voiceover it should affect some stuff

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.980 
voiceover it should affect some stuff
with<00:06:02.710> as<00:06:02.860> well<00:06:03.130> dial<00:06:03.850> pad<00:06:04.120> now<00:06:04.390> is<00:06:04.660> in<00:06:04.810> bold

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
with as well dial pad now is in bold

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.910 
with as well dial pad now is in bold
text<00:06:05.940> which<00:06:06.940> is<00:06:07.030> also<00:06:07.180> pretty<00:06:07.330> dope<00:06:07.570> and<00:06:07.920> which

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
text which is also pretty dope and which

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.250 
text which is also pretty dope and which
is<00:06:09.040> pretty<00:06:09.250> nice<00:06:09.460> if<00:06:09.910> you<00:06:10.420> like<00:06:10.750> bold<00:06:11.050> text

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
is pretty nice if you like bold text

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.110 
is pretty nice if you like bold text
they<00:06:11.920> not<00:06:12.130> also<00:06:12.280> made<00:06:12.490> up<00:06:12.670> that<00:06:12.850> when<00:06:13.060> you

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
they not also made up that when you

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.660 
they not also made up that when you
update<00:06:13.210> your<00:06:13.480> advice<00:06:13.750> there<00:06:14.500> fix<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.950> stuff<00:06:15.400> I

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
update your advice there fix the stuff I

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.040 
update your advice there fix the stuff I
think<00:06:16.090> it<00:06:16.210> can<00:06:16.360> make<00:06:16.480> your<00:06:16.630> device

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
think it can make your device

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.950 
think it can make your device
unsupervised<00:06:17.920> and<00:06:18.240> which<00:06:19.240> is<00:06:19.390> good<00:06:19.570> which<00:06:19.840> is

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
unsupervised and which is good which is

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.890 
unsupervised and which is good which is
good<00:06:20.370> so<00:06:21.370> let's<00:06:22.000> try<00:06:22.090> to<00:06:22.150> make<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.480> text<00:06:22.720> bold

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
good so let's try to make the text bold

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.830 
good so let's try to make the text bold
and<00:06:23.230> you'll<00:06:23.380> see<00:06:23.770> that<00:06:25.350> even<00:06:26.490> even<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:28.000> the

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
and you'll see that even even the the

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.160 
and you'll see that even even the the
dial<00:06:29.140> pad<00:06:29.290> will<00:06:29.860> be<00:06:30.070> in<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:31.600> little<00:06:31.780> bit<00:06:31.930> more

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
dial pad will be in a little bit more

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:43.630 
dial pad will be in a little bit more
sharper<00:06:33.070> bold<00:06:33.430> text<00:06:34.140> so<00:06:35.140> it's<00:06:35.500> pretty<00:06:35.650> nice

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.980 

so<00:06:44.640> it<00:06:44.730> doesn't<00:06:45.030> make<00:06:45.090> a<00:06:45.150> full<00:06:45.420> restart<00:06:45.810> a

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
so it doesn't make a full restart a

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.420 
so it doesn't make a full restart a
little<00:06:46.290> bit<00:06:46.380> of<00:06:46.500> research<00:06:46.860> I'd<00:06:47.280> like<00:06:47.400> to

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
little bit of research I'd like to

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.040 
little bit of research I'd like to
notice<00:06:47.790> that<00:06:47.940> the<00:06:48.000> bold<00:06:48.210> text<00:06:48.390> is<00:06:48.660> pretty<00:06:48.900> dope

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
notice that the bold text is pretty dope

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.440 
notice that the bold text is pretty dope
actually<00:06:49.560> when<00:06:49.740> you<00:06:49.860> look<00:06:50.010> at<00:06:50.160> it<00:06:50.190> I<00:06:50.450> notice

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
actually when you look at it I notice

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.730 
actually when you look at it I notice
they<00:06:51.540> don't<00:06:51.690> belong<00:06:51.960> to<00:06:52.110> this<00:06:52.200> video<00:06:52.470> but<00:06:52.620> you

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
they don't belong to this video but you

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.390 
they don't belong to this video but you
can<00:06:52.860> see<00:06:53.010> a<00:06:53.160> little<00:06:53.670> bit<00:06:53.820> more<00:06:54.810> bold<00:06:55.080> and<00:06:55.410> but

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
can see a little bit more bold and but

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.900 
can see a little bit more bold and but
now<00:06:56.700> when<00:06:56.940> we<00:06:57.120> go<00:06:57.150> into<00:06:57.690> the<00:06:58.410> this<00:06:58.980> app<00:06:59.250> you<00:06:59.760> can

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
now when we go into the this app you can

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.820 
now when we go into the this app you can
see<00:07:00.150> it's<00:07:00.480> a<00:07:00.600> little<00:07:00.660> bit<00:07:00.900> more<00:07:01.050> bold<00:07:01.290> then

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
see it's a little bit more bold then

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.060 
see it's a little bit more bold then
usually<00:07:02.820> what<00:07:03.060> you<00:07:03.210> see<00:07:03.420> in<00:07:03.480> here<00:07:03.900> so<00:07:04.620> I'm

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
usually what you see in here so I'm

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.690 
usually what you see in here so I'm
pretty<00:07:05.460> good<00:07:05.670> updates<00:07:06.590> overall<00:07:07.590> even<00:07:08.190> for

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
pretty good updates overall even for

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.340 
pretty good updates overall even for
being<00:07:08.880> a<00:07:08.970> small<00:07:09.210> update<00:07:09.390> I<00:07:09.720> mean<00:07:09.870> it's<00:07:10.320> still

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
being a small update I mean it's still

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.380 
being a small update I mean it's still
wrong<00:07:10.680> 100<00:07:11.100> megabytes<00:07:11.430> so<00:07:11.670> it<00:07:12.030> could<00:07:12.180> also<00:07:12.300> be
