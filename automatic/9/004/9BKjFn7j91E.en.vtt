and your laptop you kind of need
something<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.369> fill<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
something to do to fill the time that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
something to do to fill the time that
you<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> spend<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.829> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you use to spend on that and if you're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.359 
you use to spend on that and if you're
like<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:36.060> multiple<00:01:36.780> hours<00:01:37.110> each<00:01:37.259> day

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
like me that was multiple hours each day

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
like me that was multiple hours each day
so<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> decided<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.810> regress<00:01:40.380> back

was trying to stay away from it because
i<00:02:28.799> haven't<00:02:29.069> played<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.879> freaking<00:02:30.269> long

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
i haven't played it and so freaking long

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.410

and but since i had some extra money i

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.990 
and but since i had some extra money i
decided<00:02:33.750> Bible<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.950> that's<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.400> lot<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.549> fun<00:02:35.790> and
