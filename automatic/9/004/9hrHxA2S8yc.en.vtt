00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
them in most cases you never really want

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.110 
them in most cases you never really want
to<00:03:07.880> try<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.330> 1v1<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:09.140> gunner<00:03:10.100> at<00:03:10.400> least<00:03:10.610> up<00:03:10.820> close

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
to try to 1v1 a gunner at least up close

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.640 
to try to 1v1 a gunner at least up close
so<00:03:11.390> if<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> chance<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.110> blush<00:03:12.380> and

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
so if you have the chance to blush and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.100 
so if you have the chance to blush and
strike<00:03:12.860> them<00:03:13.010> away<00:03:13.280> keep<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.730> distance<00:03:14.110> then

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
strike them away keep the distance then

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.110 
strike them away keep the distance then
you<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> very<00:03:15.920> good<00:03:16.100> chance<00:03:16.160> because<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you have a very good chance because the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
you have a very good chance because the
cheeser<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.780> back<00:03:18.739> scratcher<00:03:19.070> are

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
cheeser and back scratcher are

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.449 
cheeser and back scratcher are
surprisingly<00:03:21.140> actually<00:03:21.590> pretty<00:03:21.769> accurate<00:03:21.980> at

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
surprisingly actually pretty accurate at

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.789 
surprisingly actually pretty accurate at
long<00:03:22.820> range<00:03:23.090> but<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:24.290> accurate<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.680> they

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
long range but not as accurate as they

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.560 
long range but not as accurate as they
are<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.040> close<00:03:25.220> range<00:03:25.400> especially<00:03:25.700> mixed<00:03:26.390> with

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
are in close range especially mixed with

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.430 
are in close range especially mixed with
a<00:03:26.860> frenzy<00:03:27.860> fire<00:03:28.070> this<00:03:28.820> guy<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.060> burn<00:03:29.870> him<00:03:30.049> shoot

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
a frenzy fire this guy I burn him shoot

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.110 
a frenzy fire this guy I burn him shoot
him<00:03:30.530> bit<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.489> should<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.700> gone<00:03:31.850> for<00:03:32.030> the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
him bit and I should have gone for the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.509 
him bit and I should have gone for the
kill<00:03:32.330> seem<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.840> how<00:03:33.080> high<00:03:33.350> my<00:03:33.620> HP<00:03:34.040> was<00:03:34.220> but<00:03:34.489> I

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
kill seem that how high my HP was but I

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.190 
kill seem that how high my HP was but I
figured<00:03:34.820> he'd<00:03:34.940> run<00:03:35.120> up<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.360> stairs<00:03:35.570> run<00:03:35.989> into

figured he'd run up the stairs run into

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.520 
figured he'd run up the stairs run into
the<00:03:36.290> grenades<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.930> really<00:03:39.290> should<00:03:39.470> have
