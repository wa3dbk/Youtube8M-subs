00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.870
 I will play part of jazz waltz composite 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.290
 couch and talk about the features of this 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.290
 music 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 but 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.470
 and 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.390
 but 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.390
 but 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.050
 Called not reconsider my son 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.240
 we define someone numbers major 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.900
 steady fish sounds one size three 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.300
 quarters 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.560
 very good exercise to master 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.560
 rhythm sting from which feature 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 Russian 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.660
 so the sound should be sharper 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.360
 as I advise him to disassemble 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.870
 determine the structure in the end it's 8 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.030
 cycles 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.380
 goes this is the first four bars this 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.380
 intro everyone will show it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.550
 wire tunes start 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.110
 at 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.860
 maybe here 16 clock structure is big 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:23.909
 henna beautiful melody clock us 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.430
 the musical life is therefore over 19 and 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.560
 learn by piece now here alone 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.769
 a feature that needs to be drawn 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:40.620
 very pebble attention has become a diet sign 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:42.870
 and sat down 13 tons this is not complexity but at the end 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:50.579
 during repetitions the melody sounds average 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:55.340
 age is necessary and because we 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:57.269
 used to fingers on top but thousands 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.160
 so this place needs to be given 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.049
 separate so that it sounds exactly 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.579
 same quality as it sounds 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.579
 beginning this place is more complicated now 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.579
 cans 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.150
 in the future it will be a high register 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.650
 need to hear in the juice register because 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.629
 that there strings thinner need more 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.090
 more active fingers take otherwise not 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:33.330
 will quietly assign than lower case 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.729
 it's all a result of hearing 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.860
 musical ear and very good 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.789
 exercise listened to long notes for 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.789
 places like this 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.510
 fingers free and fast i'm low 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.460
 hold him 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.470
 if you are on top of the earth at all prom 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.900
 rightly abbas but he would be too 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.350
 sounded loud you have to just low 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.350
 a tube 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.949
 this combination of long notes you dare to 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.610
 sting and a combination of holding a melody in 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.619
 different voices 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.719
 very useful exercise in character 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:13.939
 in music he is a very beautiful musical 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.599
 so for students it is very useful 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:19.459
 exercise recommend them to master and 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.689
 learn to play swing in this case 

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.689
 riffle jazz waltz
