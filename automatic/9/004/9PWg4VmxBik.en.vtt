00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
out to me that I'd played wrong I

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.840 
out to me that I'd played wrong I
misread<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.800> said<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> turns<00:00:17.730> out

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
misread what they said and it turns out

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.609 
misread what they said and it turns out
I<00:00:18.000> didn't<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.570> play<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.840> wrong<00:00:19.289> after

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I didn't really play that wrong after

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.429 
I didn't really play that wrong after
all<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.730> only<00:00:20.939> thing<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.539> wrong<00:00:21.810> was<00:00:22.140> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
all the only thing I got wrong was you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
all the only thing I got wrong was you
still<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.980> pay<00:00:23.010> all<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.550> actions<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
still have to pay all your actions to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
still have to pay all your actions to
deploy<00:00:24.449> several<00:00:25.140> ships<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.369> it

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
deploy several ships you can just do it

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
deploy several ships you can just do it
all<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.789> once<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> run-through

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
all at once and so in the run-through

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.790 
all at once and so in the run-through
when<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> spent<00:00:30.689> three<00:00:31.080> actions<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.619> three

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
when I spent three actions and three

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.600 
when I spent three actions and three
energy<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> deploy<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.750> snub<00:00:34.440> fighters<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
energy to deploy to snub fighters and a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.690 
energy to deploy to snub fighters and a
grunt<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.410> correct<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.980> could<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.489> just

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
grunt that was correct I could have just

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.020 
grunt that was correct I could have just
done<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.440> in<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.860> turn<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:41.969> would

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
done it all in one turn but it would

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.180 
done it all in one turn but it would
still<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.450> taken<00:00:42.780> me<00:00:42.899> three<00:00:43.200> action<00:00:43.770> points

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
still have taken me three action points

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
still have taken me three action points
and<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> run-through<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.660> did<00:00:45.840> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and in the run-through I just did it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.049 
and in the run-through I just did it
over<00:00:46.200> three<00:00:46.230> turns<00:00:46.890> spending<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.760> action

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
over three turns spending one action

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.670 
over three turns spending one action
point<00:00:48.300> apiece<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.989> means<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> end

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
point apiece which means in the end

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
point apiece which means in the end
result<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.700> comes<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> wash<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
result it all comes out in the wash and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
result it all comes out in the wash and
while<00:00:52.469> i<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.680> definitely<00:00:52.920> playing<00:00:53.370> slightly

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
while i was definitely playing slightly

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.330 
while i was definitely playing slightly
wrong<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.690> guess<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.710> gotta<00:00:55.860> take<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
wrong I guess I gotta take back what I

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
wrong I guess I gotta take back what I
said<00:00:56.399> before<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.270> still<00:00:57.539> playing

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
said before I think I was still playing

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.529 
said before I think I was still playing
close<00:00:58.109> enough<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.789> was<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> minor

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
close enough to where that was a minor

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.399 
close enough to where that was a minor
goof<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.199> opposed<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.100> major<00:01:02.820> goof<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.809> yet

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
goof as opposed to a major goof and yet

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
goof as opposed to a major goof and yet
I<00:01:04.439> jump<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> conclusions<00:01:05.549> immediately<00:01:06.150> posted

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
like somebody pointed out that in a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.460 
like somebody pointed out that in a
two-player<00:01:30.540> game<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.290> draw

this<00:01:34.970> whatever<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> mean<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.509> are

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this whatever you know I mean those are

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
this whatever you know I mean those are
the<00:01:36.780> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.380> things<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.100> goof<00:01:38.610> up

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the kind of little things that I goof up

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.010 
the kind of little things that I goof up
in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> video<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.299> i<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.450> put<00:01:39.630> annotations

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
in the video and i just put annotations

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.969 
in the video and i just put annotations
on<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.740> fundamentally

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
on because they don't fundamentally

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
on because they don't fundamentally
change<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> way<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> game<00:01:42.060> plays<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
change how the way the game plays I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.039 
change how the way the game plays I
thought<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.530> had<00:01:43.680> made<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> fundamental

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
thought I had made a fundamental

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.359 
thought I had made a fundamental
game-changing<00:01:46.049> error<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> turns<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
game-changing error but it turns out I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.770 
game-changing error but it turns out I
didn't<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.700> turns<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.030> wasn't<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
