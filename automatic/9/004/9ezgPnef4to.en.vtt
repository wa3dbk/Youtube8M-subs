00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
order to make them sound better but

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.360 
order to make them sound better but
first<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.260> thought<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.710> was<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> big<00:02:58.130> gimmick

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
first I thought that was a big gimmick

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.610 
first I thought that was a big gimmick
but<00:02:58.820> after<00:02:59.090> trying<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.570> for<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> while<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.260> think

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
but after trying it for a while I think

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.950 
but after trying it for a while I think
it's<00:03:00.770> actually<00:03:00.890> quite<00:03:01.430> nice<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.840> go

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
it's actually quite nice you have to go

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.810 
it's actually quite nice you have to go
through<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.290> entire<00:03:03.380> setup<00:03:04.010> process<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.640> it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
through the entire setup process and it

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.610 
through the entire setup process and it
takes<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.120> minute<00:03:05.420> or<00:03:05.540> two<00:03:05.690> but<00:03:06.170> after<00:03:06.320> that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
takes a minute or two but after that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.020 
takes a minute or two but after that
you're<00:03:06.920> set<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.340> good<00:03:07.460> to<00:03:07.640> go

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you're set and good to go

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.490 
you're set and good to go
so<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.660> haven't<00:03:08.960> tried<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.290> thing

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
so if you haven't tried this thing

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.170 
so if you haven't tried this thing
already<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.130> might<00:03:10.310> want<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.640> at<00:03:10.850> least<00:03:11.000> check

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
already you might want to at least check

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.450 
already you might want to at least check
it<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.630> besides<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.860> might<00:03:13.130> want<00:03:13.160> to

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
it out besides this you might want to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.160 
it out besides this you might want to
activate<00:03:13.910> developer<00:03:14.480> mode<00:03:14.600> on<00:03:14.810> your<00:03:14.930> phone
