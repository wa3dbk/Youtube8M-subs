I'm pretty positive many of you haven't

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.590 
I'm pretty positive many of you haven't
even<00:00:11.480> seen<00:00:11.870> this<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:13.010> you<00:00:13.220> might<00:00:13.700> have<00:00:14.390> seen

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
even seen this so you might have seen

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.240 
even seen this so you might have seen
this<00:00:14.750> before<00:00:14.960> and<00:00:15.650> you're<00:00:15.830> just<00:00:15.980> watching

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
this before and you're just watching

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.400 
this before and you're just watching
this<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.730> learn<00:00:16.970> some<00:00:17.840> of<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:18.020> might<00:00:18.170> just<00:00:18.230> be

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
this to learn some of you might just be

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.350 
this to learn some of you might just be
watching<00:00:18.800> this<00:00:18.890> her<00:00:19.040> kicks<00:00:19.340> to<00:00:19.970> see<00:00:20.119> how<00:00:20.180> much

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
watching this her kicks to see how much

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.109 
watching this her kicks to see how much
I<00:00:20.480> suck<00:00:20.810> we'll<00:00:21.650> just<00:00:21.800> let<00:00:22.040> you<00:00:22.190> know<00:00:22.340> I<00:00:22.550> will

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
I suck we'll just let you know I will

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.769 
I suck we'll just let you know I will
suck<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.110> don't<00:00:24.290> last<00:00:24.790> the<00:00:25.790> five<00:00:26.000> by<00:00:26.180> five<00:00:26.390> cube

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
suck so don't last the five by five cube

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.720 
suck so don't last the five by five cube
is<00:00:27.490> very<00:00:28.490> very<00:00:29.240> similar<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.169> four-by-four

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
is very very similar to the four-by-four

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.960 
is very very similar to the four-by-four
before<00:00:31.730> by<00:00:31.880> four<00:00:32.150> looks<00:00:32.599> like<00:00:32.750> this<00:00:33.130> yes<00:00:34.130> over

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
before by four looks like this yes over

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.930 
before by four looks like this yes over
phone<00:00:35.000> yes<00:00:35.180> i'm<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.570> nerd<00:00:35.810> I've<00:00:36.079> both<00:00:36.730> well<00:00:37.730> in

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
phone yes i'm a nerd I've both well in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.210 
phone yes i'm a nerd I've both well in
this<00:00:38.450> one<00:00:38.660> I'm<00:00:38.960> going<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.560> show<00:00:39.650> you<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.800> method

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
this one I'm going to show you a method

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.650 
this one I'm going to show you a method
that's<00:00:40.310> very<00:00:40.610> similar<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.120> full-back<00:00:41.480> for

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
that's very similar to the full-back for

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.280 
that's very similar to the full-back for
here<00:00:42.530> just<00:00:42.680> get<00:00:42.860> all<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.060> method<00:00:44.780> is<00:00:45.230> very

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
here just get all this method is very

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.830 
here just get all this method is very
simple<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.730> learned<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:47.150> from<00:00:47.180> another<00:00:47.570> guy

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
simple and I learned it from another guy

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.750 
simple and I learned it from another guy
to<00:00:48.200> probably<00:00:49.010> learned<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:49.310> off<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.730> internet

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
to probably learned it off the internet

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.170 
to probably learned it off the internet
from<00:00:50.420> another<00:00:50.630> guy<00:00:51.100> anyways<00:00:52.100> I'm<00:00:52.820> going<00:00:53.120> to

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
from another guy anyways I'm going to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.680 
from another guy anyways I'm going to
show<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.390> how<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.440> saw<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:55.160> beast<00:00:55.490> is<00:00:55.850> these

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
show you how I saw this beast is these

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.410 
show you how I saw this beast is these
is<00:00:57.350> one<00:00:57.590> of<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.740> easiest<00:00:58.000> problems<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.150> think

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
is one of the easiest problems I think

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.180 
is one of the easiest problems I think
to<00:00:59.720> solve<00:00:59.990> because<00:01:00.530> if<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.860> know<00:01:00.980> how<00:01:01.130> to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
to solve because if you know how to

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.810 
to solve because if you know how to
solve<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.200> this<00:01:03.369> you're<00:01:04.369> one<00:01:04.580> step

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
solve this and this you're one step

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.690 
solve this and this you're one step
ahead<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.239> game<00:01:06.130> first<00:01:07.130> I'm<00:01:07.340> going<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.549> ask

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
ahead of the game first I'm going to ask

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.090 
ahead of the game first I'm going to ask
you<00:01:07.850> some<00:01:08.390> questions<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.409> first<00:01:09.439> question<00:01:09.710> is

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
you some questions the first question is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.349 
you some questions the first question is
can<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.880> solve<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.810> 3<00:01:11.990> by<00:01:12.140> 3<00:01:12.170> or<00:01:12.560> 4<00:01:13.369> by<00:01:13.490> 4<00:01:13.729> because

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
can you solve a 3 by 3 or 4 by 4 because

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.330 
can you solve a 3 by 3 or 4 by 4 because
if<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.689> can<00:01:14.719> you<00:01:15.590> can<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.770> skip<00:01:16.070> ahead<00:01:16.130> to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
if you can you can just skip ahead to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.999 
if you can you can just skip ahead to
the<00:01:16.490> next<00:01:16.820> part<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.479> video<00:01:17.810> because<00:01:18.289> this

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
the next part of this video because this

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.880 
the next part of this video because this
next<00:01:19.579> minute<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.299> a<00:01:20.329> half<00:01:20.359> two<00:01:20.719> minutes<00:01:20.890> four

next minute and a half two minutes four

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.529 
next minute and a half two minutes four
minutes<00:01:21.920> however<00:01:22.340> long<00:01:22.579> it<00:01:22.729> takes<00:01:22.759> I'm<00:01:23.179> going

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
minutes however long it takes I'm going

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.399 
minutes however long it takes I'm going
to<00:01:23.600> be<00:01:23.689> explaining<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.319> orientation<00:01:26.409> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
to be explaining the orientation the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.649 
to be explaining the orientation the
point<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.189> meaning<00:01:28.549> whatever<00:01:29.179> you<00:01:29.450> want<00:01:29.600> to

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
point the meaning whatever you want to

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.510 
point the meaning whatever you want to
call<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.549> orientation<00:01:31.549> is<00:01:33.069> well<00:01:34.069> to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
call it of the orientation is well to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.629 
call it of the orientation is well to
help<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.630> figure<00:01:36.469> out<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.950> algorithms<00:01:37.520> that

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
help you figure out the algorithms that

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.160 
help you figure out the algorithms that
i'm<00:01:37.819> going<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:37.999> give<00:01:38.179> you<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.689> figure<00:01:38.960> out<00:01:39.079> this

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
i'm going to give you to figure out this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.200 
i'm going to give you to figure out this
cube

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.590 

now<00:01:44.210> if<00:01:44.450> you're<00:01:44.600> familiar<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:45.080> parody<00:01:46.010> and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
now if you're familiar with parody and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.910 
now if you're familiar with parody and
you<00:01:47.600> really<00:01:47.930> don't<00:01:48.080> have<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.350> listen<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.740> this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
you really don't have to listen to this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.000 
you really don't have to listen to this
because<00:01:49.250> parody<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.450> when<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.650> use<00:01:51.980> a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
because parody is when you have to use a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.810 
because parody is when you have to use a
very<00:01:52.520> very<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:52.910> very<00:01:53.450> long<00:01:53.990> algorithm<00:01:54.820> to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
very very very very long algorithm to

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820 
very very very very long algorithm to
fix<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.390> cube<00:01:56.660> so<00:01:56.870> you<00:01:56.990> can<00:01:57.140> solve<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.440> normally

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
fix the cube so you can solve a normally

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.260 
fix the cube so you can solve a normally
but<00:01:58.220> i'm<00:01:58.310> going<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.550> show<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:58.850> when<00:01:59.150> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
but i'm going to show you that when it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.480 
but i'm going to show you that when it
happens<00:02:00.010> now<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.280> know<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
happens now that you know the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.110 
happens now that you know the
orientation<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.600> what<00:02:03.290> parody<00:02:03.650> is<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:04.120> slight

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
orientation and what parody is a slight

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.300 
orientation and what parody is a slight
idea<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.630> what<00:02:05.780> parody<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.260> I'm<00:02:06.860> just<00:02:07.070> going<00:02:07.280> to

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
idea of what parody is I'm just going to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.580 
idea of what parody is I'm just going to
show<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.600> some<00:02:08.600> cool<00:02:08.780> tricks<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.229> can<00:02:09.259> do<00:02:09.470> on

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
show you some cool tricks you can do on

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.020 
show you some cool tricks you can do on
the<00:02:09.679> five<00:02:09.830> by<00:02:09.950> five<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.490> is<00:02:10.580> really<00:02:10.729> stupid

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the five by five this is really stupid

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.240 
the five by five this is really stupid
and<00:02:11.420> very<00:02:11.960> unnecessary<00:02:12.290> but<00:02:12.800> I'm<00:02:12.890> gonna<00:02:13.010> do<00:02:13.160> it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and very unnecessary but I'm gonna do it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.430 
and very unnecessary but I'm gonna do it
anyways<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:14.300> wanna<00:02:14.420> make<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.690> checkered<00:02:15.110> some

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
anyways you wanna make it checkered some

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.660 
anyways you wanna make it checkered some
of<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.650> might<00:02:15.740> not<00:02:15.890> know<00:02:15.950> how<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.160> go<00:02:16.370> ahead<00:02:16.520> do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of you might not know how to go ahead do

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.370 
of you might not know how to go ahead do
this<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.120> rotate<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.050> right<00:02:18.200> side

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
this you just rotate the right side

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.170 
this you just rotate the right side
twice<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.920> then<00:02:19.280> move<00:02:19.430> your<00:02:19.459> hand<00:02:19.700> over<00:02:19.850> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
twice and then move your hand over and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.790 
twice and then move your hand over and
rotate<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.570> twice<00:02:20.780> again<00:02:21.080> move<00:02:21.590> your<00:02:21.650> hand

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
rotate that twice again move your hand

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.980 
rotate that twice again move your hand
over<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.220> rotate<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.610> twice<00:02:22.790> again<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.570> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
over and rotate that twice again and so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.300 
over and rotate that twice again and so
on<00:02:24.140> till<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.440> get<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> end<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.040> then<00:02:25.190> you

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
on till you get to the end and then you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550 
on till you get to the end and then you
have<00:02:25.490> white<00:02:26.450> yellow<00:02:26.600> white<00:02:26.870> you're<00:02:27.440> white

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
have white yellow white you're white

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.820 
have white yellow white you're white
player<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.550> then<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.240> rotate<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.630> either<00:02:30.590> way

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
player and then you rotate it either way

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.260 
player and then you rotate it either way
left<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> right<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.640> doesn't<00:02:31.820> matter<00:02:32.090> just

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
left to right it doesn't matter just

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.740 
left to right it doesn't matter just
rotated<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.870> then<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.650> same<00:02:33.920> thing<00:02:36.340> good

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
rotated and then you same thing good

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.540 
rotated and then you same thing good
there<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.780> got<00:02:39.410> check<00:02:39.920> your<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.340> side

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
there you got check your on this side

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.970 
there you got check your on this side
and<00:02:40.820> check<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.690> now<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.650> have

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and check in on this up now you have

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.770 
and check in on this up now you have
stripes<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> middle<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:44.510> we're<00:02:44.600> trying<00:02:44.660> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
stripes in the middle so we're trying to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.390 
stripes in the middle so we're trying to
do<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.959> just<00:02:45.110> set<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.320> down<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:46.160> do<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> same

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
another stupid human Rubik's Cube trick

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.140 
another stupid human Rubik's Cube trick
and<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.350> will<00:03:21.530> show<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.890> later<00:03:21.920> but<00:03:22.850> right<00:03:22.880> now

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
and I will show you later but right now

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.280 
and I will show you later but right now
I'm<00:03:23.299> still<00:03:23.570> trying<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.870> figure<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.140> out

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
I'm still trying to figure it out

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.410 
I'm still trying to figure it out
because<00:03:24.530> it'll<00:03:24.890> switch<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.310> Centers<00:03:25.670> but

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
because it'll switch the Centers but

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.670 
because it'll switch the Centers but
when<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.630> switch<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.989> Centers<00:03:27.290> every<00:03:27.500> time<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
when I switch the Centers every time to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.320 
when I switch the Centers every time to
try<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:27.920> get<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.100> back<00:03:28.280> it'll<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:28.820> mess<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
try and get it back it'll just mess the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.940 
try and get it back it'll just mess the
queue<00:03:29.540> up<00:03:29.720> andand<00:03:29.900> I'm<00:03:30.140> having<00:03:30.410> just<00:03:30.680> mess<00:03:30.920> it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
queue up andand I'm having just mess it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.180 
queue up andand I'm having just mess it
up<00:03:31.130> any<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.360> go<00:03:33.170> ahead<00:03:33.260> move<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.070> to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
up any of this so go ahead move on to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.080 
up any of this so go ahead move on to
the<00:03:34.280> next<00:03:34.340> video<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.060> we'll<00:03:35.540> start<00:03:35.780> solving
