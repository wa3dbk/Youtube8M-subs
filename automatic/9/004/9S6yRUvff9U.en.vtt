00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 4 boys and girls that just like you are 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.629
 I am víctor genes 3 and I am in ping ping 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.629
 He explained that the game is called 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.139
 I've played a couple of times like this 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.539
 had played very little and the truth a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.980
 bomb 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 ok and the truth is that I do not have much 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 idea of ​​joining that I've seen some 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.539
 videos and so on and I've played one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.730
 a game or something like that but the truth is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.960
 that I do not have a lot of idea of how 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.740
 it works is so yes you have to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.570
 throw you have to shoot the enemies and 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.260
 Of death 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.200
 valencia as well as what 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.820
 danger not why why why 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.300
 Well, I do not know why we lost 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:54.670
 so let's go into another room we 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.740
 let's see is 17-7 I really do not know 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.270
 what's happened dead I think there's a 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.660
 gold block or something like that right now 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.479
 equally game but but I think a 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.820
 gold block that when they take it then 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.880
 directly the game is not finished 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.760
 I'm very sure so I would not know either 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.590
 sign it at 100% but yes I do 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.970
 something that sounds like it then yes you 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.550
 we will leave lost and one pursued with 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.860
 little bit strange or I think that fix them I think 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.869
 what is given there in the middle is 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.050
 try to catch not to see if we make a 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.340
 round victory worth voucher worth as 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.910
 it would be or would have to remove before 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.910
 nothing this 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:41.119
 walker uf uf is going to be very complicated 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.119
 It will be very difficult to caracas 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.950
 the secret potion 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 and that is possible today in this in this 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.619
 more not at stake is now yes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.619
 come, come, come 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:08.080
 again it's been mine has been punctured 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.160
 how do you stay randomly from 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.450
 quique splif today we try this 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.450
 let's go to the one who explained 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.280
 or a game is made for this 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.880
 what did he explain 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.430
 I thought this was just for babies in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.590
 serious then how handsome chávez me 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.879
 infiltrated here as if there were no 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.280
 tomorrow I infiltrated the one that needs to be 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.740
 explain 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.900
 the game will be once 0 players will 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.010
 join that is, start now and we will 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.360
 prove what it is 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 I suppose it has to be 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.540
 the game is super difficult 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.660
 this complicated 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.580
 I think I'm going slow now but the pink 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 pink something 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.770
 today this is very dodgy 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:29.310
 it is impossible 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.310

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.840

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.060
 Let's go there 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.110
