Alzheimer's disease and now I'm going to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
Alzheimer's disease and now I'm going to
do<00:00:22.170> something<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.980> really<00:00:23.369> very

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
do something that is really very

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.550 
do something that is really very
exciting<00:00:24.359> because<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.779> different<00:00:25.289> from<00:00:25.350> all

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
exciting because it's different from all

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.450 
exciting because it's different from all
of<00:00:25.680> those<00:00:25.830> its<00:00:26.840> anti-aging<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.590> suppose

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of those its anti-aging I suppose

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.589

I'll<00:00:31.050> tell<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.470> maybe<00:00:31.769> do<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
I'll tell you how you can maybe do it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.030

the<00:00:32.969> I've<00:00:33.600> made<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.110> important<00:00:34.620> discovery

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the I've made a very important discovery

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
the I've made a very important discovery
regarding<00:00:35.219> grains<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.239> legumes<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
regarding grains and legumes and a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
regarding grains and legumes and a
special<00:00:37.260> sugar<00:00:37.710> found<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.309> those<00:00:38.550> CD<00:00:38.969> foods

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
special sugar found in those CD foods

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
special sugar found in those CD foods
also<00:00:40.050> found<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.649> citrus<00:00:41.070> fruits<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.969> will

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
also found in citrus fruits which will

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.889 
also found in citrus fruits which will
probably<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> trick<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:44.660> do<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.780> know

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
probably do the trick now do we know

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
probably do the trick now do we know
what<00:00:46.050> causes<00:00:46.289> aging<00:00:46.620> there's<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
what causes aging there's a lot of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.920 
what causes aging there's a lot of
research<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> moment<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.719> quite

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
research on this at the moment is quite

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.209 
research on this at the moment is quite
exciting<00:00:49.230> some<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> most<00:00:49.890> interesting

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
exciting some of the most interesting

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
exciting some of the most interesting
medical<00:00:50.730> research<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> happening<00:00:51.660> on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
medical research of all is happening on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
medical research of all is happening on
on<00:00:51.960> Aging<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.059> may<00:00:54.180> be

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
on Aging and we think that there may be

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
on Aging and we think that there may be
some<00:00:54.510> oxidation<00:00:54.809> happening<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.739> older

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
some oxidation happening as we get older

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.729 
some oxidation happening as we get older
the<00:00:56.550> DNA<00:00:56.969> deteriorates<00:00:57.710> senescent<00:00:58.710> cells

the DNA deteriorates senescent cells

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
the DNA deteriorates senescent cells
form<00:00:59.309> we're<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.730> really<00:00:59.879> sure<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.300> mechanism

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
form we're not really sure the mechanism

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
form we're not really sure the mechanism
it<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.109> intriguing<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.090> fantastically

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it will be intriguing and fantastically

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
have anti-aging properties because it

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940 
have anti-aging properties because it
has<00:03:39.940> some<00:03:40.090> anti-cancer<00:03:40.420> properties<00:03:40.959> which

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.290

there<00:04:08.920> was<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.100> possibility<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.760> grain<00:04:10.090> and

anti-aging so we had to move on from
that<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.650> see<00:05:24.860> if<00:05:25.100> there<00:05:25.790> were<00:05:25.880> any<00:05:25.910> further<00:05:26.300> if

it<00:05:58.310> is<00:05:58.430> almost<00:05:58.640> certain<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.210> if<00:05:59.450> we<00:05:59.600> increase

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
it is almost certain that if we increase

who<00:06:55.449> looks<00:06:55.629> about<00:06:55.809> 34<00:06:56.409> these<00:06:57.099> are<00:06:57.249> remarkable

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
who looks about 34 these are remarkable

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.909 
who looks about 34 these are remarkable
people<00:06:58.149> and<00:06:58.599> i'm<00:06:58.960> suggesting<00:06:59.139> we<00:06:59.529> can<00:06:59.680> all<00:06:59.800> be

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
people and i'm suggesting we can all be

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.709 
people and i'm suggesting we can all be
the<00:07:00.039> same<00:07:00.069> sort<00:07:00.490> of<00:07:00.550> thing<00:07:00.819> so<00:07:01.210> if<00:07:01.419> we<00:07:01.449> don't

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
the same sort of thing so if we don't

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:05.279 
the same sort of thing so if we don't
have<00:07:01.930> magic<00:07:02.349> genes<00:07:02.619> for<00:07:02.860> 110<00:07:03.490> years<00:07:03.930> we<00:07:04.930> maybe

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.289 
have magic genes for 110 years we maybe

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:07.049 
have magic genes for 110 years we maybe
don't<00:07:05.499> have<00:07:05.649> change<00:07:05.919> for<00:07:05.979> a<00:07:06.099> hundred<00:07:06.219> years<00:07:06.369> if

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:07.059 
don't have change for a hundred years if

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.579 
don't have change for a hundred years if
we<00:07:07.180> don't<00:07:07.330> have<00:07:07.479> those<00:07:07.569> jeans<00:07:07.899> what<00:07:08.110> can<00:07:08.259> we<00:07:08.379> do

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:08.589 
we don't have those jeans what can we do

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:10.379 
we don't have those jeans what can we do
we<00:07:09.069> can<00:07:09.099> listen<00:07:09.369> to<00:07:09.550> what<00:07:09.729> I'm<00:07:09.849> saying<00:07:09.879> and

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389 
we can listen to what I'm saying and

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.089 
we can listen to what I'm saying and
you'll<00:07:10.629> probably<00:07:10.899> get<00:07:11.169> a<00:07:11.229> result<00:07:11.649> you<00:07:11.949> at

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099 
you'll probably get a result you at

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.829 
you'll probably get a result you at
least<00:07:12.129> have<00:07:12.399> a<00:07:12.459> lot<00:07:12.610> of<00:07:12.639> energy<00:07:12.849> but<00:07:13.419> you<00:07:13.569> must

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:13.839 
least have a lot of energy but you must

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.129 
least have a lot of energy but you must
do<00:07:14.020> low-fat<00:07:14.649> slightly<00:07:15.520> oily<00:07:15.909> very<00:07:16.479> seedy<00:07:16.839> once

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
do low-fat slightly oily very seedy once

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.260 
do low-fat slightly oily very seedy once
again<00:07:17.409> slightly<00:07:17.709> oily<00:07:18.189> is<00:07:18.309> fish<00:07:18.580> marjorine

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
again slightly oily is fish marjorine

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.989 
again slightly oily is fish marjorine
olive<00:07:19.689> oil<00:07:19.869> nuts<00:07:20.139> and<00:07:20.439> avocado<00:07:20.860> and<00:07:21.219> CD<00:07:21.909> of

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:21.999 
olive oil nuts and avocado and CD of

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:23.639 
olive oil nuts and avocado and CD of
course<00:07:22.209> is<00:07:22.419> corn<00:07:22.719> oats<00:07:22.839> nuts<00:07:23.169> beans<00:07:23.409> and

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:23.649 
course is corn oats nuts beans and

00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:26.189 
course is corn oats nuts beans and
rockmelon<00:07:24.610> or<00:07:24.789> citrus<00:07:25.149> are<00:07:25.270> honorary<00:07:25.659> seeds

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
rockmelon or citrus are honorary seeds

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.749 
rockmelon or citrus are honorary seeds
because<00:07:26.409> they<00:07:26.619> have<00:07:26.740> a<00:07:26.800> lot<00:07:26.949> of<00:07:26.979> inositol<00:07:27.249> in

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 
because they have a lot of inositol in

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.249 
because they have a lot of inositol in
them<00:07:27.939> so<00:07:28.360> i<00:07:28.389> think<00:07:28.509> this<00:07:28.779> is<00:07:28.899> a<00:07:28.930> major

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259 
them so i think this is a major

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:31.439 
them so i think this is a major
discovery<00:07:29.619> in<00:07:29.949> anti-aging<00:07:30.330> something<00:07:31.330> else

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:31.449 
discovery in anti-aging something else

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.209 
discovery in anti-aging something else
might<00:07:31.599> come<00:07:31.659> along<00:07:31.959> like<00:07:32.289> an<00:07:32.379> anti-aging<00:07:32.979> pill

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:33.219 
might come along like an anti-aging pill

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.829 
might come along like an anti-aging pill
from<00:07:33.430> an<00:07:33.520> intensive<00:07:33.999> research<00:07:34.180> happening<00:07:34.569> in

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:34.839 
from an intensive research happening in

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.570 
from an intensive research happening in
America<00:07:35.050> now<00:07:35.409> which<00:07:35.919> might<00:07:36.159> boost<00:07:36.399> this

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580 
America now which might boost this

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.760 
America now which might boost this
further<00:07:36.909> certain<00:07:37.659> special<00:07:37.990> antioxidants

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
further certain special antioxidants

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.469 
further certain special antioxidants
which<00:07:38.949> can<00:07:39.159> be<00:07:39.279> located<00:07:39.759> in<00:07:39.849> part<00:07:40.059> of<00:07:40.180> the<00:07:40.240> cell

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 
which can be located in part of the cell

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.059 
which can be located in part of the cell
where<00:07:40.930> the<00:07:40.990> energy<00:07:41.319> is<00:07:41.349> produced<00:07:41.589> they<00:07:41.889> may

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:42.069 
where the energy is produced they may

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:43.649 
where the energy is produced they may
also<00:07:42.219> be<00:07:42.459> anti-aging<00:07:43.059> they<00:07:43.149> might<00:07:43.330> be<00:07:43.419> looking

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:43.659 
also be anti-aging they might be looking

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:46.320 
also be anti-aging they might be looking
at<00:07:43.719> 120<00:07:44.349> hundred<00:07:44.620> and<00:07:44.709> 1350<00:07:45.309> but<00:07:45.909> with<00:07:46.149> what

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330 
at 120 hundred and 1350 but with what

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.939 
at 120 hundred and 1350 but with what
I'm<00:07:46.479> saying<00:07:46.809> I<00:07:46.990> think<00:07:47.139> we're<00:07:47.499> looking<00:07:47.649> at<00:07:47.889> a

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:47.949 
I'm saying I think we're looking at a

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:51.420 
I'm saying I think we're looking at a
good<00:07:48.279> 95<00:07:49.089> or<00:07:49.330> hundred<00:07:49.889> extremely<00:07:50.889> healthy<00:07:51.129> and

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.430 
good 95 or hundred extremely healthy and

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.059 
good 95 or hundred extremely healthy and
very<00:07:51.909> energetic<00:07:52.300> years<00:07:53.110> and<00:07:53.409> that's<00:07:53.800> my<00:07:54.009> story

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:54.069 
very energetic years and that's my story
