00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.040

 very fuel ball show worth 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.910
 very worthwhile 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.040
 A good thing is that the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.380
 rockstar brought to us 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.810

 Why do you have a car that he dumps? 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.660
 too fast you can not go in 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.450
 in case the fuel has run out 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.840
 before light travels 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.640
 entering it even in the canteen car 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.989
 It will become invalid, you can not 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.450
