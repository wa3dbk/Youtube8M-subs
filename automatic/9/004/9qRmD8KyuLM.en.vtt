hi<00:00:05.670> I'm<00:00:06.029> Laurie<00:00:06.299> from<00:00:06.509> being<00:00:06.750> my<00:00:06.870> bonnet<00:00:07.259> and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
hi I'm Laurie from being my bonnet and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.890 
hi I'm Laurie from being my bonnet and
I'm<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> show<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.300> how<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> solve<00:00:09.780> these

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
I'm going to show you how to solve these

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.070 
I'm going to show you how to solve these
rectangles<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:11.210> to<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.389> little

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
rectangles on to this little

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.140 
rectangles on to this little
great-granny<00:00:13.559> block<00:00:13.889> from<00:00:14.820> my<00:00:14.969> book

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
great-granny block from my book

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.599 
great-granny block from my book
great-granny<00:00:15.630> squared<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.490> get

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
great-granny squared so that we can get

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.670 
great-granny squared so that we can get
ready<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> square<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.300> blocks<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.260> don't

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
ready to square the blocks so I don't

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.060 
ready to square the blocks so I don't
really<00:00:19.859> use<00:00:20.070> pins<00:00:20.460> when<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:22.070> section

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
really use pins when I do this section

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.300 
really use pins when I do this section
all<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:25.099> I'm<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.830> put<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> squares

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
all I do is I'm going to put the squares

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.479 
all I do is I'm going to put the squares
here<00:00:30.240> kind<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> center<00:00:31.130> but<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> can't

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
here kind of in the center but I can't

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
here kind of in the center but I can't
really<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> center<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
really see the center because the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
really see the center because the
navy-blue<00:00:34.590> blends<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.760> down<00:00:36.059> here

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
navy-blue blends but I can down here

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
navy-blue blends but I can down here
because<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.380> will<00:00:37.530> hang<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> quarter<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
because this will hang over a quarter of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.010 
because this will hang over a quarter of
an<00:00:38.430> inch<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.629> eyeball<00:00:39.989> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
an inch so I just kind of eyeball it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
an inch so I just kind of eyeball it
right<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.950> doesn't<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.760> exactly

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
right here doesn't have to be exactly

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.979 
right here doesn't have to be exactly
centered<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.530> trim<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> off<00:00:43.980> anyway

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
centered because we trim it off anyway

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
centered because we trim it off anyway
so<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.680> start<00:00:47.039> sewing<00:00:47.719> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
so what I do is I just start sewing and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.380 
so what I do is I just start sewing and
this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> point<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:51.300> know

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this is the point where all you know

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
this is the point where all you know
just<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.079> centered<00:00:52.440> even<00:00:52.860> with

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
just kind of get them centered even with

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.279 
just kind of get them centered even with
the<00:00:53.100> edge

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.369 

and<00:00:57.829> I'll<00:00:57.920> just<00:00:58.129> continue<00:00:58.280> sewing<00:00:59.050> all<00:01:00.050> the

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
and I'll just continue sewing all the

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.860 
and I'll just continue sewing all the
way<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.829> end<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:01.550> at<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:02.480> point<00:01:02.750> I'll

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
way to the end and at this point I'll

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.450 
way to the end and at this point I'll
probably<00:01:02.899> put<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.320> leaders<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.829> Enders<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.250> you

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
probably put a leaders and Enders in you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.550 
probably put a leaders and Enders in you
know<00:01:04.549> how<00:01:04.759> I<00:01:04.790> do<00:01:04.960> but<00:01:05.960> I'll<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.229> continue

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
know how I do but I'll just continue

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.649 
know how I do but I'll just continue
sewing<00:01:07.009> around<00:01:07.220> or<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.790> can<00:01:07.970> even<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:08.360> lift

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
sewing around or you can even just lift

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.350 
sewing around or you can even just lift
it<00:01:08.750> up<00:01:09.130> leave<00:01:10.130> your<00:01:10.340> thread<00:01:10.640> hanging<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:11.119> little

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
it up leave your thread hanging a little

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.539 
it up leave your thread hanging a little
bit<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:13.630> place<00:01:14.630> another<00:01:14.899> one<00:01:15.140> there<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.590> once

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
bit and place another one there and once

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.840 
bit and place another one there and once
again<00:01:16.880> start<00:01:17.570> sewing<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.229> corner<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.820> you

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
again start sewing on the corner so you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.760 
again start sewing on the corner so you
could<00:01:20.119> pivot<00:01:20.299> on<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.659> corners<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.140> could<00:01:21.649> do

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
could pivot on the corners you could do

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.289 
could pivot on the corners you could do
whatever<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.159> wanted<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.580> do<00:01:22.759> if<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.060> don't

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
whatever you wanted to do if you don't

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.300 
whatever you wanted to do if you don't
use<00:01:23.479> leaders<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:23.960> Enders<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.860> doesn't<00:01:25.159> matter

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
use leaders and Enders it doesn't matter

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.249 
use leaders and Enders it doesn't matter
if<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.700> flap<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.180> down<00:01:26.420> we're<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:26.840> worried

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
if this flap is down we're just worried

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.499 
if this flap is down we're just worried
about<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:27.649> seam<00:01:27.890> right<00:01:28.130> here<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.149> do<00:01:29.240> like

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
about this seam right here but I do like

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.770 
about this seam right here but I do like
to<00:01:29.539> lift<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.990> up<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.550> see<00:01:31.789> that<00:01:32.539> there's

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
to lift it up just to see that there's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.760 
to lift it up just to see that there's
about<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.770> same<00:01:34.009> amount<00:01:34.659> hanging<00:01:35.659> over<00:01:35.990> on

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
about the same amount hanging over on

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.200 
about the same amount hanging over on
both<00:01:37.429> sides<00:01:37.789> of<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.090> center<00:01:38.240> square<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:41.060> is

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
both sides of the center square this is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.730 
both sides of the center square this is
just<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.450> quick<00:01:41.659> way<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.229> don't<00:01:42.440> have<00:01:42.560> to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
just a quick way so you don't have to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.249 
just a quick way so you don't have to
measure<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.250> can<00:01:43.789> I<00:01:44.179> don't<00:01:44.929> want<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
measure and can I don't want you to

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.230 
measure and can I don't want you to
think<00:01:45.440> that<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.490> know<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.670> really<00:01:46.909> have<00:01:47.119> to

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
think that you know you really have to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.600 
think that you know you really have to
go<00:01:47.330> through<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.569> lot<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.780> trouble<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.500> put<00:01:49.399> these

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
go through a lot of trouble to put these

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.309 
go through a lot of trouble to put these
on<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:50.240> really<00:01:50.479> have<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.750> do<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.110> make

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
on all you really have to do is make

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.609 
on all you really have to do is make
sure<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.890> they're<00:01:52.280> across<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.119> center

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
sure that they're across the center

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.580 
sure that they're across the center
enough<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:55.520> they're<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.119> right<00:01:56.270> point<00:01:56.630> or

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
enough that they're the right point or

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.010 
enough that they're the right point or
you<00:01:57.679> can<00:01:57.830> square<00:01:58.100> them<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.759> also<00:01:59.630> to

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
you can square them up and also to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.570
