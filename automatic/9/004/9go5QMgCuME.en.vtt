good here now compressor case
temperatures<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.540> big<00:04:18.750> one<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.109> case

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350

degrees<00:04:22.560> lower<00:04:22.979> than<00:04:23.130> before<00:04:23.520> why<00:04:24.450> this<00:04:24.510> big

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
degrees lower than before why this big

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.270

difference<00:04:25.290> well<00:04:25.470> we've<00:04:25.650> got<00:04:25.830> proper

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280

compressor lubricate

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.500 
compressor lubricate
remember<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.590> lubricant<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.510> transported

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
remember the lubricant is transported

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.050 
remember the lubricant is transported
through<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:30.930> system<00:04:31.380> by<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.060> refrigerant

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
through this system by the refrigerant

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.700 
through this system by the refrigerant
so<00:04:33.270> with<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.420> proper<00:04:33.870> charge<00:04:34.080> near<00:04:34.410> we're<00:04:34.590> now

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
so with a proper charge near we're now

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.430 
so with a proper charge near we're now
getting<00:04:34.890> better<00:04:35.430> lubrication<00:04:36.150> flow<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.290> is

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
getting better lubrication flow this is

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.540 
getting better lubrication flow this is
going<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> extend<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.070> life<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.460> the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
going to extend the life of the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.180 
going to extend the life of the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
components also a duct temperature with

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.810 
components also a duct temperature with

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
the doors closed on max a/c drops to 44

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.730 
the doors closed on max a/c drops to 44
degrees<00:04:45.240> now<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:45.870> have<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.080> understand<00:04:46.590> the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
degrees now I have to understand the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.380 
degrees now I have to understand the
ambient<00:04:47.160> temperature<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.730> shop<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.180> day

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
ambient temperature in the shop that day

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.350 
ambient temperature in the shop that day
was<00:04:48.600> 104<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.770> weird<00:04:49.950> 44<00:04:50.550> degrees<00:04:50.880> inside<00:04:51.300> I

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
was 104 so weird 44 degrees inside I

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.620 
was 104 so weird 44 degrees inside I
think<00:04:51.720> we're<00:04:51.840> cooling<00:04:52.020> pretty<00:04:52.350> good
