joints as you can see Houston traffic is
quite<00:02:13.360> busy<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.470> mornings<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:18.310> while

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
quite busy in the mornings so while

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.710 
quite busy in the mornings so while
sitting<00:02:19.730> at<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> light<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.330> always<00:02:20.540> want<00:02:20.690> to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
sitting at the light you always want to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.080 
sitting at the light you always want to
have<00:02:20.840> your<00:02:21.050> mirrors<00:02:22.090> set<00:02:23.090> properly<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:25.090> watch

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
have your mirrors set properly and watch

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.180 
have your mirrors set properly and watch
out<00:02:26.330> for<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.630> people<00:02:26.810> behind<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.530> -<00:02:27.740> because

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
out for the people behind you - because

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.210 
out for the people behind you - because
they<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:28.790> take<00:02:29.450> off<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.050> get<00:02:30.650> too<00:02:30.860> close<00:02:31.160> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
they can take off and get too close and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.830 
they can take off and get too close and
that's<00:02:31.640> when<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.000> get<00:02:32.150> rear-ended<00:02:32.660> that's

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
that's when you get rear-ended that's

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.120 
that's when you get rear-ended that's
why<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.020> always<00:02:33.260> want<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.740> your<00:02:33.770> head

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
why you always want to have your head

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.080 
why you always want to have your head
back<00:02:34.459> against<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.060> headrest<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.760> notice

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
back against the headrest you notice

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.420 
back against the headrest you notice
that<00:02:41.300> we<00:02:41.959> need<00:02:42.170> full<00:02:42.410> range<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.860> motion<00:02:43.040> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
that we need full range of motion to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.340 
that we need full range of motion to
turn<00:02:43.670> our<00:02:43.850> head<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.270> look<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.630> traffic<00:02:44.870> both

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
turn our head and look for traffic both

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.080 
turn our head and look for traffic both
directions<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> rear<00:02:46.880> view<00:02:46.910> mirror

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
directions and in the rear view mirror

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.270 
directions and in the rear view mirror
now<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.750> can<00:02:48.110> go<00:02:48.580> very<00:02:49.580> good

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.510 

now<00:02:53.850> while<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.240> driving<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.920> really<00:02:56.250> want

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
now while you're driving you really want

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.510 
now while you're driving you really want
to<00:02:58.520> again<00:02:59.630> be<00:03:00.630> seated<00:03:01.110> upright<00:03:01.440> like<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.340> am

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
to again be seated upright like I am

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.580 
to again be seated upright like I am
right<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:03.300> your<00:03:03.450> head<00:03:03.690> back<00:03:03.990> against

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
right now with your head back against

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.450 
right now with your head back against
the<00:03:04.710> headrest

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
the headrest

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.300 
the headrest
because<00:03:05.850> accidents<00:03:06.450> happen<00:03:07.200> while<00:03:07.770> you're<00:03:08.130> on

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
because accidents happen while you're on

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.000 
because accidents happen while you're on
the<00:03:08.520> freeway<00:03:08.790> or<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.390> road<00:03:09.570> as<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the freeway or on the road as well and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.630 
the freeway or on the road as well and
again<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> laws<00:03:14.400> of

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
again you know the laws of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.990 
again you know the laws of
thermodynamics<00:03:16.010> object<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.160> motion<00:03:17.370> tends<00:03:17.880> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
thermodynamics object in motion tends to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
thermodynamics object in motion tends to
stay<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.330> motion<00:03:18.480> well<00:03:19.260> an<00:03:19.620> object<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.220> motion

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
stay in motion well an object in motion

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.900 
stay in motion well an object in motion
that<00:03:20.880> gets<00:03:21.180> hit<00:03:21.510> by<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.130> faster<00:03:23.130> object<00:03:23.730> in

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
that gets hit by a faster object in

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.479 
that gets hit by a faster object in
motion<00:03:24.470> accelerates<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.800> motion<00:03:26.070> and

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
motion accelerates that motion and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.770 
motion accelerates that motion and
causes<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.270> more<00:03:27.959> severe<00:03:28.590> whiplash<00:03:29.370> or<00:03:30.120> spinal

causes a more severe whiplash or spinal

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.740 
causes a more severe whiplash or spinal
trauma<00:03:32.120> hyperextension<00:03:33.120> hyperflexion
