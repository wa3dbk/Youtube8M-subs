best<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.360> saw<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.900> person<00:04:59.170> pushing

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
best because I saw this person pushing

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.850 
best because I saw this person pushing
me<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.220> pushing<00:05:00.280> me<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.300> pushing<00:05:01.360> me<00:05:01.930> but

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
me and pushing me and pushing me but

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.760 
me and pushing me and pushing me but
then<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.160> realized<00:05:03.880> that<00:05:04.750> this<00:05:04.960> person<00:05:05.410> was<00:05:05.530> not

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
then I realized that this person was not

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.590 
then I realized that this person was not
pushing<00:05:06.130> me<00:05:06.400> but<00:05:07.030> what<00:05:07.180> they<00:05:07.270> were<00:05:07.330> actually

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
pushing me but what they were actually

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.740 
pushing me but what they were actually
doing<00:05:08.050> was<00:05:08.380> reaching<00:05:08.800> down<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.040> lifted<00:05:09.700> me<00:05:09.850> to

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
doing was reaching down and lifted me to

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.500 
doing was reaching down and lifted me to
the<00:05:10.870> next<00:05:11.050> level<00:05:11.410> of<00:05:11.500> my<00:05:11.530> life<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:12.220> think<00:05:13.120> future

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
the next level of my life I think future

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.890 
the next level of my life I think future
educators<00:05:14.320> seek<00:05:15.040> that<00:05:15.340> as<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:15.910> career<00:05:16.510> path

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
educators seek that as a career path

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.880 
educators seek that as a career path
because<00:05:17.560> they<00:05:18.040> probably<00:05:18.820> have<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.780> leg<00:05:20.410> up<00:05:20.620> on

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
because they probably have a leg up on

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.060 
because they probably have a leg up on
being<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.490> contributor<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.330> society<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.500> can't
