00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.939
 for those new to the channel or not 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.310
 see the previous video tutorial 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.320
 supreme of the hunter I leave here is 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.210
 important that you see it before this one 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.460
 since today we are going to focus on a 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.120
 Very slut skill of the hunter called 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.700
 of the explosive trap your great friend or 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.539
 tell your enemy as stress or something 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.539
 andy or your fucking mother 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.820
 to the people 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.550
 and I want to put special emphasis on this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 skill in the pvp which is where 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 truth serves and helps well first 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.670
 you have to know and understand the function 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 of the explosive trap and its glyph looks 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 that in a moment of clarity he knew 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.610
 think of all the victims of the fart of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 the shamans and decided to give us the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.900
 opportunity to return it folded to 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.030
 them and all the classes with only one 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.580
 button you get that said glyph and now 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.400
 you must learn how to use it in the place 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.380
 just at the right moment remember that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.150
 the important thing is to take us into account is 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.220
 the best or that we get it right at least 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.010
 the problem can come from failure of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.250
 calculation at the time of launching it either by 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 nervousness or by external factors such as 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.270
 the typical one here with mental retardation of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 your team that just by throwing your 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.170
 victim he brings him back with his 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 lethal attraction fuck do not ask me 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.310
 because maybe a disease can not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.720
 avoid being delayed but pussy always 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 that there is a deck on the die just 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 bringing my enemy or your egg here 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 but I do not want to deviate from the subject 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.160
 main throwing an explosive trap is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.990
 an art an art that should for 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.430
 tempt yourself and create school the factor 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.600
 surprise is vital to catch your 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 victim leaving her 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
 the time necessary to prepare your 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.869
 flight to the moon so make wise use 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.570
 of your other skills like camouflage 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.130
 and patience let's not forget that for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 further boost the frustration of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 our enemies we can combine the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.950
 explosive trap with many skills 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.990
 there are great infinity of tactics or combos 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.180
 for example the dispersion shot + 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.070
 exclusive trap and if you want to go even more 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.350
 of pro test the scatter shot 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.950
 freezing trap and explosive trap 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.110
 to mark you a group to fuck 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.300
 or even use your friends as 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.340
 sexual complaint to generate confusion 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.590
 nothing else 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.150
 analyze our environment to get the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.800
 use that we want with the trap will be 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 essential because the vast majority of 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.310
 Sometimes we do not know how to appreciate the points 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.349
 key that can help us bitch the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.209
 otherwise another combination very bristle is 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.830
 use the explosive trap to kill a 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.959
 enemy within the radius of a boss or 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.330

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.849

 infinite life of combinations in 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.000
 limits so much ill imagination 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.099
