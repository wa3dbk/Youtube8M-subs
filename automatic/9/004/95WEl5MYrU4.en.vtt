some reason

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.559 
some reason
here<00:02:15.200> we've<00:02:15.379> seen<00:02:15.680> four<00:02:16.249> tanks<00:02:16.549> in<00:02:16.670> town<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.150> I

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
here we've seen four tanks in town and I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.940 
here we've seen four tanks in town and I
don't<00:02:17.719> know<00:02:17.810> where<00:02:17.989> their<00:02:18.170> other<00:02:18.319> 11<00:02:18.709> tanks

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
don't know where their other 11 tanks

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.800 
don't know where their other 11 tanks
are<00:02:19.129> just<00:02:20.030> where<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.239> could<00:02:20.359> guess<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
are just where we could guess is that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.500 
are just where we could guess is that
the<00:02:20.959> probably<00:02:21.439> scouting<00:02:22.069> town<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.639> then<00:02:23.329> once

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the probably scouting town and then once

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.910 
the probably scouting town and then once
we<00:02:23.629> push<00:02:23.840> through<00:02:24.049> town<00:02:24.260> they<00:02:24.499> have<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> kill

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
we push through town they have a kill

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.599 
we push through town they have a kill
zone<00:02:24.950> at<00:02:25.459> like<00:02:25.639> g3<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:27.079> know<00:02:27.200> e<00:02:27.379> 1<00:02:27.709> D<00:02:28.010> 1<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.400> if

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
zone at like g3 you know e 1 D 1 and if

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:29.890 
zone at like g3 you know e 1 D 1 and if
they<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.849> whole<00:02:28.999> bunch<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.209> Tanks<00:02:29.510> back<00:02:29.689> as

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
they have a whole bunch of Tanks back as

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.720 
they have a whole bunch of Tanks back as
soon<00:02:30.049> as<00:02:30.139> I<00:02:30.230> pushed<00:02:30.469> through<00:02:30.799> I'm<00:02:31.370> gonna<00:02:31.549> lose

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
just find some kind of opening and take

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.170 
just find some kind of opening and take
advantage<00:03:39.259> of<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.650> soon<00:03:40.310> as<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> 26<00:03:40.879> that<00:03:41.000> gets

south all right so at this point I do

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:36.280 
south all right so at this point I do
call<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.400> push<00:04:34.690> mediums<00:04:35.690> are<00:04:35.780> progressing<00:04:36.200> up

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
call the push mediums are progressing up

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.800 
call the push mediums are progressing up
a<00:04:36.380> little<00:04:36.590> bit<00:04:36.680> as<00:04:36.770> well

a little bit as well

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.480 
a little bit as well
so<00:04:38.470> our<00:04:38.560> goal<00:04:38.680> here<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.070> we're<00:04:39.190> going<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.340> try

nice job i hotter there
can<00:06:20.690> either<00:06:20.810> go<00:06:20.990> up<00:06:21.020> 72<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:22.040> now<00:06:22.130> they<00:06:22.250> have<00:06:22.370> all

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
can either go up 72 so now they have all

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.280 
can either go up 72 so now they have all
their<00:06:22.640> tanks<00:06:22.910> back<00:06:23.060> in<00:06:23.180> g1<00:06:23.480> g2<00:06:23.510> it's<00:06:23.960> just<00:06:24.110> at

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
their tanks back in g1 g2 it's just at

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.840 
their tanks back in g1 g2 it's just at
this<00:06:24.500> point<00:06:24.770> we<00:06:25.100> need<00:06:25.250> the<00:06:25.310> mediums<00:06:25.610> to<00:06:25.730> come

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
this point we need the mediums to come

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.610 
this point we need the mediums to come
in<00:06:25.940> from<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.090> east<00:06:26.180> we<00:06:26.960> need<00:06:27.080> heavies<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.500> come

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
in from the east we need heavies to come

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.990 
in from the east we need heavies to come
in<00:06:27.710> from<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.890> north<00:06:28.040> and<00:06:28.610> then<00:06:28.730> we'll<00:06:28.910> get

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
in from the north and then we'll get

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.730 
in from the north and then we'll get
around<00:06:29.120> on<00:06:29.480> all<00:06:29.600> sides<00:06:29.840> of<00:06:29.990> them<00:06:30.110> will<00:06:30.500> win<00:06:30.620> the

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
around on all sides of them will win the

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:39.090 
around on all sides of them will win the
game<00:06:30.920> no<00:06:31.820> problem

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.500 

so<00:06:39.670> this<00:06:39.820> point<00:06:40.000> it<00:06:40.060> looks<00:06:40.090> like<00:06:40.270> we<00:06:40.360> are<00:06:40.480> going

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
so this point it looks like we are going

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.090 
so this point it looks like we are going
to<00:06:40.780> win<00:06:40.870> the<00:06:40.930> game<00:06:40.960> had<00:06:41.260> a<00:06:41.290> great<00:06:41.530> push<00:06:41.740> in<00:06:41.890> town

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
tillers take out the fog we probably

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.980 
tillers take out the fog we probably
