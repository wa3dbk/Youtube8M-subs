00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
just goes in the back here so that's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
just goes in the back here so that's
nice<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.570> you've<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> know

Ethernet<00:01:26.430> HDMI<00:01:26.689> optical<00:01:27.689> audio<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.320> your

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
Ethernet HDMI optical audio out and your

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.719 
Ethernet HDMI optical audio out and your
regular<00:01:29.070> multi<00:01:29.369> AV<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:31.670> otherwise<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
regular multi AV and then otherwise I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.899 
regular multi AV and then otherwise I
mean<00:01:33.590> it's<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.829> basic<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.490> thing<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> i

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
mean it's pretty basic one thing that i

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
mean it's pretty basic one thing that i
do<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.509> though<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.930> way<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
do not see though is a way to take the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
do not see though is a way to take the
hard<00:01:38.250> drive<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> upgrade<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
hard drive out to upgrade it like you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
hard drive out to upgrade it like you
would<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.920> current<00:01:41.280> ps3<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
would on the current ps3 which is a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.609 
would on the current ps3 which is a
little<00:01:42.360> disappointing<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:46.409> here

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
little disappointing but and then here

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
little disappointing but and then here
we<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.040> existing<00:01:47.490> ps3<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
we have the existing ps3 so we can do a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.139 
we have the existing ps3 so we can do a
little<00:01:48.509> side<00:01:48.750> by<00:01:48.930> side<00:01:49.170> comparison<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.149> they

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
little side by side comparison here they

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.499 
little side by side comparison here they
look<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.590> pretty<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.220> same<00:01:53.509> length

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
look to be pretty much the same length

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.950 
look to be pretty much the same length
this<00:01:54.720> way<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.280> shorter<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.960> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
this way so it's just shorter and a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
this way so it's just shorter and a
little<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.229> thinner<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.860> look<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.189> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little bit thinner if you look at it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.469 
little bit thinner if you look at it
from<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> top<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.939> kind<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
from the top you can kind of see that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
from the top you can kind of see that
it's<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.469> quite<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.799> fat<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.450> basically

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it's it's not quite as fat but basically

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.590 
it's it's not quite as fat but basically
it's<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> height<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.829> guess<00:02:05.610> width<00:02:05.909> drop

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.020 

and<00:02:08.950> weight<00:02:09.950> wise<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.400> is<00:02:10.430> definitely<00:02:10.670> lighter

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and weight wise it is definitely lighter

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.150 
and weight wise it is definitely lighter
it<00:02:11.660> still<00:02:11.930> feels<00:02:11.960> solid<00:02:12.650> doesn't<00:02:12.920> feel<00:02:13.040> like

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it still feels solid doesn't feel like

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.470 
it still feels solid doesn't feel like
it's<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.580> know<00:02:13.610> stuff<00:02:13.880> moving<00:02:14.150> around<00:02:14.210> in

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
it's you know stuff moving around in

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's you know stuff moving around in
there<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:15.220> power<00:02:16.220> any<00:02:16.370> jet<00:02:16.580> buttons<00:02:16.790> are<00:02:17.000> now

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
there the power any jet buttons are now

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.630 
there the power any jet buttons are now
actual<00:02:17.570> tactile<00:02:18.530> buttons<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:19.010> opposed<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.460> the
