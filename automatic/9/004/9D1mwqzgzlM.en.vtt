00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
 and this 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 and the fifth firmness has been 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.359
 Wallis already caught up with another video 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.820
 of the channel and good people in this one 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.740

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 here a very different video does not usually 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.010
 bring a lot here on the channel but I decided 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.990
 bring a worthwhile server 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 show you a very bad man 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.300
 that mikrotik that is the most if pvp 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.219
 point tecau and will have the inscription is more 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 one basically that I said there write 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.540
 points and with a very smooth server 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.370
 a top server here. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.270
 I recommend that you enter there is a point 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.149
 7.2 a bit of 7.4 1.715 is a server 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.550
 without any full soup several to several 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 websites huge varieties of 15 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 different moderators are willing to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.170
 do a better job here for you 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.539
 have fun if that's a fair server 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.189
 right né and they have gained very good server 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.110
 I'm enjoying to play whoa here I 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.939
 I recommend not liking it, eh 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.340
 recommended in the subscribers to play also 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.049

 the path is without any care she 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.450
 it is very easy to play with the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.360
 kangaroo on a lot the pt is also very 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.759
 Turning the kits that are paid and tals 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.439
 and to those who have vip and even want 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 Talk to you if you want, you have one. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.009
 channel on youtube with more than 1 each 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.110
 with over one thousand subscribers, right? 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 if you have more than one car you can 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 Catch up until October from here, I had to 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.750
 is doing several other tags that are 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 being developed the server if I do not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
 mistake should have a week and little 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.490
 sevilla is being developed to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 few and also in the whole year, little by little 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 if you find a bug such bug 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.829
 reporter such a practical escape from the team that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.840
 will probably have in the description 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.790
 escape from him and mine too 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 It's always there if you want to talk some 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 thing with me there because I'm like mod 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 Arm commodity on a server is kind not 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.270
 I walk in a lot and I like to get 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.799
 a not so much post that I will not have 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 a lot of tactical responsibility has 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.340
 responsibility but not so much then 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.629
 It's just to be more good and more than 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.270
 any personal way you are doing 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.740
 Any luck to you now that good. 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.330
 here the user in search 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.130
 There are only four teams 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.930
 probably tic more forward and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.250
 I think it will create faster and this will only 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.900
 back up and running the first one is a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.150
 fps 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.140
 4 - If you have reported here to show 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.770
 for you 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.950
 both here is mpf psf totally by 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.620
 out is great so it's very good, huh? 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.230
 cool as hell is ground in giant 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.020
 There has been a life that has already 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.600
 seems to have a loaded the floor but it is well 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.300
 Cool same size as ufpe king of the table 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.340
 also including that the first event 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 party, it's okay to go from 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 deport it including the first event 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.970
 From the ufpe and the table I won I just 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.140
 do not vip to my friend, neither 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.910
 I ended up earning the way I already had 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.130
 moderate mode né 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.570
 I ended up taking vip always think mission 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.400
 here at the time without permission here in 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.990
 income but basically king of the table 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.180
 for those who do not know is an event that 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.870
 basically you are the players enter 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.270
 these cabin go out and the moderators will 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.500
 calling for on and such and will make a pvp 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.970
 last remaining 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.580
 Tite is always doing events here. 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.790
 the team that is left takes a vip or some 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.500
 kits then we talk in chat that is what 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.120
 We're going to give it so it's not cool, is it? 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.350
 The hospital only explained why 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 There are people who do not know, I'm sure. 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.510
 that right 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.160
 sometimes there is a person who does not know is 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.830
 a very cool way to get your 1 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.510
 Do you come with this grid here? 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.730
 gladiators is not who you play for 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.310
 Were you personally what I'm talking about? 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.110
 which has a new holder and such is used 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.580
 this grid you click the face and up to and 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.320
 per table up by a villain then 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.880
 It's very good to use this here. 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.130
 the deputy then I'm going to have to kill myself 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.230
 here can not really give more touch and last 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.180
 time is erp drago never via cell phone 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.610
 asking for a look at the wheel hand snails 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.560
 dragon that call very fuck same and 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.060
 I had never reached the turn of Iraq but 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.340
 I do not think it 's under construction yet 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.870
 likely to dismount add more 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.940
 some things here then build 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.560
 that staircase is such 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 it will probably be very show 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.400
 beauty in person you should already know 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.930
 how does the 15 maybe i want 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.370
 show yourself because you have 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.500
 some that are very different here 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.570
 buying comparing with must be made 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.880
 finally I'll start showing cancer 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.060
 which is even catching you one day 10 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.100
 here staff barrage 0 inclusive 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.520
 kangaroo who is without shame 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.660
 OK 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.430
 It's him and I play better than the mcp I go 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.830
 he had a business that went from being 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.930
 good but anyway there is much better mpb and 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.550
 then in fact equality did here 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.250
 There is no way to discharge it, so it's 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.110
 very good if I show you the type 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.150
 or give to those who do not know when you say 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 paraense What do you use the field has and 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.300
 When the guy annoys you, you can not. 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.919
 more use delegates to wait for 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.840
 spend a few seconds of silence to 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.580
 can use and canon 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.470
 You can be so it 's a pity you. 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.629
 is on pv pps want to give a hint start 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.490
 the Italian run is up funny goes 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.050
 install a tv for 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.729
 The guy starts, we're just going to give 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.590
 a launched campaign launched on is 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.720
 cool, this is one of the coolest things 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.490
 server is to use exchange but if you 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.280
 want to play serious working 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.470
 recommends recommend if you catch 11 football 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.389
 Because of pvp you have increased 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.340
 your hair is because the goal of 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.750
 server that provides penalty is 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.610
 you have a height ca is one of the 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.759
 Best in heaven I think in my 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.710
 design is the game I know will have 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.789
 For this to be one of the best only 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.620
 as I have not understood it lately 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.030
 much here on the chic server, right? 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.349
 then only see five years for each 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.590
 school and other things I have to 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.789
 do and tals né my channel and such I go 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.460
 Every once in a while you played if I'm not mistaken. 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:40.050
 is showing at 140 pounds and I died 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.400
 many times my god 7715 then type 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.080
 but the goal if I were to focus 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 play serious goal similar to the baby 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.650
 it was going up the road 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.419
 so I recommend that you do not get the 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.250
 exchange if you want to give a street and pr 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.259
 take the exchange but this is a 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.330
 of the exchange kits is showing the two 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.490
 You will be protected for a long time. 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.990
 Great thrill all the kits here then 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.940
 let me kill you good, who gets the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.560
 mouse clicks on the floor and has several 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.990
 days I was there and I got what 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.139
 we want and neither kit and simon is boxing 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.090
 own boxer pro box the best 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.460
 practically takes the life of the guy very much 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.349
 I did not want to show it, but anyway. 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.599
 show me but always kill me here 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.969
 face that celebrate because a nail that 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:22.150
 That's why I'm full of death and 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.740
 show you what you stomp 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.990
 hermanos showed that the tested perea 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.330
 that titon by the sun itself comes with 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.880
 The ones with the stamp is a kit is a 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.570
 joining two kits where the staff did 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.279
 that what the usda dm is doing in it 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.930
 So it's too fucking ugly. 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:43.509
 for example these guys here 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:45.880
 You know that it's okay or I killed you. 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.430
 Someone dying will get a little life 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.870
 she was fighting but basically it is 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.940
 that old folks a joint of two 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.599
 kits so this is very interesting and well 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.310
 cool 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.620
 Any other who wants to show you will see 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.219
 to the expert guys when you kill 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.349
 two guys you can enchant your 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:04.839
 things and you come with so do not 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.310
 Mistake is not a big deal in the matter 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.960
 more pot of sp 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.940
 Then you can sing everything. 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.070
 So it 's really cool 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.960
 specialist people if you want 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.060
