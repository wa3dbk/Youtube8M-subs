00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.360
 Some ideas such as those we have discovered are born from the period of 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.660
 training of those who set them up are born of knowledge is the case 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.379
 of sofitec the aeronautical technology firm that we want to meet 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.119
 background in this edition of 'space company and that was born of two young people 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.510
 professionals that ten years later so work a hundred people from 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.880
 his profile 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 today in space company we will know in depth 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.789
 associates 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 located in January police this company manufactures parts and elements for aircraft 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.500
 and that's been years ago has had a surprising evolution reaching 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.810
 occupy a prominent position in the Sevillian aeronautical industry 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.250
 in 10 thousand square meters the intense activity of a company that concentrates 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.110
 In just over a decade, it has multiplied by 15 its volume of 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.330
 deal 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.480
 sofitec differs from other companies 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 because it covers the entire production process from the design of the piece 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.720
 for the plane until its packaging because we began the visit to its front 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 in the department where everything arises in the department where the gh is created 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 subsequently they will become 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 they begin elements for for they had made them unaccompanied by 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.350
 manuel pérez who is the financial director 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.070
 I need manuel there who starts the whole production process of the company 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.770
 san josé a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.760
 percent when I arrived at the customer's order 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.990
 here element is designed and accompanied with the control department of 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.370
 production are those that launch the design 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.710
 solve 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.900
 ii all that man apart from manufacturing is moved, we'll see when 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.730
 on October 12 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.130
 from here the first step 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.380
 Iranian antolin work from home in that department we do not have about 25 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.690
 people dedicated to this work of generating design 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 and they are manufactured so all kinds of 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.780
 of piece I have a little bit left that this design is what becomes a 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.549
 Distinction is like a torrent of factory moment drill goals 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.570
 order 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.280
 i instinct of elements that united a red set 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 The more complex the topic, the more added value 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.549
 is the solution that we go to the client company 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.339
 the company was born from the idea of ​​two young people 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.509
 like those who work in this laboratory today 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.809
 the company has divided its production into these two lines 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.769
 to adapt to the new demands of the sector optical arena poneman elqui 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.719
 from the giraffe samo to the process of exclusion quijano who what is done 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.639
 in this sofitel plant 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.909
 by looking here we have life of the company's food 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.250
 We have the line of manufacturing metal elements mobile factory 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.439
 assembled mobile we finally treat the product according 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.469
 the contribution we have here is final assembly made pizzeria and 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:51.799
 final treatment 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.799
 we were going towards the manufacturing part of mechanization 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.149
 it was to get to get pieces as complex as these deposits 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:09.999
 disposable 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.849
 a very important process 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.370
 the process of mechanization that is carried out in this machine alejandro 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.540
 white is responsible for this workshop the workshop manager 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.449
 and he is in charge of managing this machine and applying what it consists of 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.289
 because so important Alexander Martin 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.680
 percent and went from a machining center 5 Jan 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.680
 and the possibility of machining are huge 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.459
 turning of a bail of 2 meters in diameter 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.339
 cited the possibility of machining in five years the only machine was to go 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:45.699
 with that characteristic in Spain what results are sustained here in this part 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:46.749
 of process 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.429
 the operating result of the green mojo company went from the piece 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.869
 moves completely and then 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:58.839
 a five-axis fidel finish has raised 5 of fabric a power surface 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.769
 and in what we get for all the requests 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.590
 that the aeronautico alejandra retires the image that is doing the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.590
 machine fought on moto2 by enac 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.909
 a first explosion 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.339
 one piece 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.579
 what in four axes 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.999
 as bringing 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.059
 pd goes through 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.770
 tobago or you 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.749
 the field was subtracted 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.349
 he gets ideal point can be tuned when we have the first 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.699
 execution and everything is ok for quality we manufacture the series to see manufacture the 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.889
 fair to veto this factory 1 80 a month 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.340
 with a production of metal parts already consolidated 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.540
 sofitec understood two years ago should evolve 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:49.379
 In this plant that started operating in 2009, pieces are manufactured in fiber 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.449
 carbon and other composite materials a laying for the future of the 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.749
 aeronautics 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.349
 their advantage is that they are lighter 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.409
 the process starts here 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.099
 is the so-called clean room where the material is cut 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.269
 aseptic in the manufacturing process of parts and elements of 

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:14.900
 carbon fiber undoubtedly this phase which is performed on that machine 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.650
 in one of the most important 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.300
 of the process the director of the angel plant hepatic liver 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.590
 because this machine is so important that it is shorter term 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.059
 with this machine where the property is given that the material that 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.979
 you need to cut back on its use 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.339
 that's an oven 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.829
 in which in addition to controlling the temperature the pressure is controlled 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.449
 and the vacuum that occurs in the pit where the fifa is made 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.169
 that in addition to controlling the temperature of the environment are also controlled 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.830
 among others pointed out beat 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.840
 i the final result was just that you said over here 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:53.119
 how can we say goodbye how a pressure cooker of natixis knows how to resemble 

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.960
 a depression 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.010
 depends on the properties that 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.539
 since you need the parts for later use 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.210
 that makes a cycle a recipe 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.120
 it's worth it in that recipe because he was a ramp since his life is worth where 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.730
 temperature goes increasing degree of work achieved gin 8 minutes and 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.690
 then he to his maintenance of that temperature that where already the resin that 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.070
 the only piece is homogenized and that really gives me the property that does not 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.779
 they have food and control 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:23.789
 I do not know how many hours press so simple can go from followers to 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:24.559
 please two 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.100
 depending on how they work 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.129
 sofitel factory for the main companies of the sector optical arona good 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.879
 It is obviously to the streets of Villa before leaving this one 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.409
 but military 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.069
 read the old one of shuttles 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.210
 and actually 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.020
 we pretend álex cross 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.919
 to the surprise 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.350
 my life apart from that good have failed to work jorge towers 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.819
 percent work 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.389
 Press release 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.659
 out of Spain through the theft with force Persian alliances 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.039
 and between those projects establish the production lines 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.800
 to further unify all phases of the process including certification 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.249
 quality 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:12.159
 from the head of an engineer to the painting and finishing workshop is a journey 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.159
 that the parties have to do to fulfill their mission 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:20.939
 make it possible for an airplane to fly a complete process that encompasses all 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:22.460
 production phases 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.370
 and that has led sofitec to become a high-flying company within 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.249
 of the powerful Andalusian aeronautical sector
