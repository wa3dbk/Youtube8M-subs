 castro 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.959
 the goal with a goal time in Bologna 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.819
 it's a science that studies 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.820
 percent the effect that a living being generates 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.630
 one 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.300
 in this case on the river 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.140
 end the metabolomics an embryo the block the envion generate 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.180
 in this case it is a culture medium 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.509
 the embryos that grow in private hours 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.660
 in liquid culture media that consents nutrients go down to keep you 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.510
 and that the situation of the crop is as similar 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.140
 alludes to bushes do not raise the bush 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.040
 the question tables of the year are enriched gil with my elements 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.820
 bazaar carbohydrates 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.500
 what the embryo is taking more in its first days of life 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.310
 for smith and this one 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.880
 i 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.600
 the pretty mole embryo and eliminate this fact well growing medium 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.770
 that if we have the possibility to differentiate them 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.670
 evaluating it for example quantifying the goods 2 what amount produce yes 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.370
 what types of waste produce 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.230
 one can sagasti characteristics and evolution has crowds 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.240
 one can take it 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.390
 ap both a crop boot and evaluate by means of technology 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.790
 and the bone waste qualitatively this sample and how much of each of 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.800
 these embryo waste 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.040
 since very recently we have such a wide knowledge of this but it has been 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.380
 been evaluating 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.370
 i 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.670
 city ​​pop products 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.190
 fergus the embryo 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.990
 insi quantity and according to this steve chen was fresh thanks to a tip 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.350
 if you can not evaluate 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 according to the score on the table is tightened will end well evaluated many 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.950
 embryos so kind of meeting to get an embryo denis fornet has 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.860
 returned therefore better tame quality to peace in Ireland still to a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.730
 embryo of me no metabolism has more altered that will win - capable 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.640
 to implement soria or that one can choose and select 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.809
 the best embryos of the court you have to transfer first the 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.049
 embryos with him 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.239
 said elizabeth illicit metabolic 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.159
 the others I wanted to lend you the antzizar will be for transfers 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.399
 Justice 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.569
 metabolomics has a peculiarity 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.279
 So we are going to study the cultivation of change in particular 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.010
 that as well as sometimes one cultivates two by December 13 11 - the boot 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:48.129
 these embryos should be grown each in a demille cultivated boot 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.949
 issued individually 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.620
 I take the precaution that the pilate eat the sample 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.789
 of the cultivation pharmacy 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.020
 axtel results of these at short time 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.200
 can not be satisfied the continuous growth 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.769
 yes no what has to be quickly transferred today's announcement 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:09.760
 vienna 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.539
 Bush 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.509
 It was obviously destroyed 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.200
 are technologies for this to bring is very short enough time 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.629
 in huila expenses of that invention human sunat shows signs environment 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.479
 and this allows us on selected blackboard 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.029
 to embryos apart from their morphology and their dynamics 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.179
 growth are accessible to van der sar going on throughout the days 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.129
 in how it behaves functional 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.429
 if you want you can show which of them all that same day you apple
