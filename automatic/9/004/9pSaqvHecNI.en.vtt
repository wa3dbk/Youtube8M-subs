00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello to all guitars enthusiastic 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 Playing the guitar is only fun if 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 the guitar is tuned right and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 That's why I'm telling you today how to do that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.190
 guitar tunes without voices as 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.190
 first games gold the deep 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.010
 it is on the title page in the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.010
 fifth bunch 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 There is the sound of this sound here 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.180
 sounds 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.180
 So your next page must sound empty 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.789
 if you notice that your tone is too low 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.830
 then you turn the whirl of 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.830
 get away from me i'll do that as an example 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.970
 which sound is too high 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.970
 come to you 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 for as long as these two tones 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.500
 to match 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.460
 especially high 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.460
 because compare 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.130
 and you have already voted the a-side 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.229
 if you have decided the a side is 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.710
 you on this page also in the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:44.600
 fifth and there is the sound de as well 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.899
 this sound in five months on the a 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 The page sounds like this must be the next page 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.380
 empty 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.380
 sounds like compare 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.390
 In that case you might be a bit 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.390
 turn higher height of consistently 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 to compare 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.060
 perfect if they have determined the page 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.420
 you go back to the fifth and on 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.420
 rural side 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.040
 just as this sound sounds like this here 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.519
 he is really empty on the next page 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.090
 You could compare sound once 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.090
 the turn in height 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.260
 perfect now you have to be on the fourth 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.520
 page in the fourth and you can 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.660
 remember quite well fourth page 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:50.490
 the fourth is booming and that's how the sound sounds 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.770
 how this sounds must be yes on the fifth 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:04.670
 page on the side also sound empty 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:05.930
 once compare detuned so can 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.280
 By the way, you are also very good to your ears 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.800
 school if you keep doing it 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.450
 Gets the feeling like beautiful 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.070
 lie to each other and how they sound 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.780
 have to 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.520
 if you have this hair side the fifth 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.460
 has also made page is doing there 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.700
 then back to the fifth and through that 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.700
 ii 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.620
 and so the last page must be empty 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.620
 sound a bit higher, too 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.390
 when we arrived, you are 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.390
 we finished testing that with a ego 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.480
 sounds good 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.370
 I give now again the first gates 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.420
 that he has this video among yours 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.239
 save favorites 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.950
 would have the purely theoretical times the 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.430
 first sound around your guitar 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.430
 agree 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.180
 your very personal tuner, so to speak 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.670
 should have any questions 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.690
 I like to write on facebook 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.670
 otherwise wish you much fun 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.860
 everything you do 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.760
 Watch out for digital teachers 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.760
 fleshy
