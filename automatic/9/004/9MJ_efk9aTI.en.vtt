00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone today I'm going to tell you little things 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.049
 depending on what you need for your 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.240
 hair for your hair I will tell you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.070
 three little natural things that serve in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 special for something that you want 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.109
 do to your hair I do not know if I'm 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.520
 giving an understanding but already as they have 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.779
 come out they will realize what I speak 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.279
 with the little things that I will be 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.859
 saying you can make a mask you 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 will give options of what it is that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.769
 you can do and which one is the most 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 acebillo that in my case what I want is 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.460
 make a mask to hydrate the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.960
 hair everything is super easy everything is super 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 simple to probably get all 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 have at home or in the business 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 find him so he's not going to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.550
 be something so complicated and now I'm going 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 to start saying the little things 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.640
 little things if you want what you want 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.440
 do is hydrate your hair what more 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.700
 I recommend it is mayonnaise does not have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 that being a law has to be mayonnaise 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.780
 normal and it's really good because 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 It moisturizes the hair too much from the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.949
 root to the tips and you have the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 mayonnaise dry hair is the best 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.410
 obviously there are other things that also 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480
 they will serve to moisturize your hair 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.180
 like the egg like natural oils 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.590
 but in general the lack is super good 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.910
 and it's very easy to get if you want 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.110
 make a mask to hydrate the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.670
 hair like is what I'll do 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 let's use 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 or avocado not as it was given in your country 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.170
 extra virgin extra virgin olive oil and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.939
 mayonnaise avocado or avocado has 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.259
 to be super mature so that we do not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.170
 it costs so much to move it and after 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.090
 having chopped it add 2 tablespoons 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.200
 mayonnaise state has exact amount 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.940
 will be depending on the length of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 our hair our hair 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.960
 then I turned and added a little trickle 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.820
 of olive oil 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.690
 this is like the consistency that we 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.549
 the mixture has to stay and you have to 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.040
 apply it on media hair to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.580
 tips and it gave me a lot of disgust you can see 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.580
 in my face 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.460
 and then let's act 30 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.310
 minutes 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.090
 to finally remove it very very well 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090
 with water 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.280
 If what you want is late, the best is 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.750
 also honey is a natural moisturizer 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.490
 that serves a lot to brighten the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.229
 hair to make it look healthier and you 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.880
 see more how more movements coexist if 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.920
 you want to make a mask to give 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.670
 shine to your hair you can use honey 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.410
 obviously egg and natural yogurt all 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.240
 this if you mix it and use it from media to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.940
 points a little higher you leave them 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.350
 30 minutes current and then you wash not 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.940
 with very hot water is going to be a 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.820
 super easy mask to make super 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.830
 cheap and it will give a lot of cold to your 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.810
 hair and finally to repair or 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.140
 rebuild if you have very hair 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.140
 damaged very burnt this nest or very 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.209
 mistreated the best is the coconut oil 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.890
 natural oils in general are 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.900
 super good for hair oil 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.310
 Coconut besides being natural is very good 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.380
 to rebuild the whole world knows him 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 and is super famous for the properties 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.080
 good you have for millions of things 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.580
 you can also use instead of this 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.170
 olive oil but of coconut oil 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.470
 it really has properties and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.450
 nutrients that are much better or 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.459
 superior that help more than the oil of 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.080
 olive but still the two serve if 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.790
 you want to make a mask with oil 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.390
 of coconut you can mix it also with 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.920
 lack 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.080
 avocados that is also super good 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.090
 to rebuild and obviously the egg 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.950
 that serves almost everything and because the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.540
 game is so good for all the egg is 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.580
 super good to rebuild hair 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.140
 because it strengthens it from the root and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.110
 It also helps to make it much more 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.570
 strong and not be so weak or not 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.490
 maltreats both the chemical 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.880
 things that you do as smooth the 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.340
 dryer the dryer I do not know how they say 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.450
 the tincture and all those things that all 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.490
 we know that they mistreat the hair a lot 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.270
 then as a summary to hydrate the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.040
 mayonnaise to shine the honey and to 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.950
 rebuild the avocado the water or the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.330
 avocado and coconut oil I hope that 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.010
 you liked the video that you have 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.600
 served they have made a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.250
 mask with the little things that I gave them 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.570

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.400
