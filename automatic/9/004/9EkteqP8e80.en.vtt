00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 a short more crazy link the title of the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.250
 Running a hot is crazy, right there. 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.880
 easter eggs how long is in the rule 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.880
 just and good where can get the eye 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.379
 clinical but more lost and I do not think 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:26.340
 what are you going to shave after seeing 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:36.809
 Good, what I said, nothing is so good. 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:41.120
 that although the beautiful one that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.120
 it was in a single building beyond the building 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:01:00.420
 Do you know how to do it? 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:13.610
 in the evening at 11 in order to achieve 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 reach the lighthouse and was pushed ghost 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:30.150
 free car free galley 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.790
 first because when the second set 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 was the ground is a mad incarnate 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.740
 av 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.860
 What is going to faint is relative but he 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 You're lucky you're already scared of the face. 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 already says that it is bad luck how it goes 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.180
 win a race or think about michael 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.950
 Bonzão and this has been confirmed once was 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.950
 nicolas confirmed on win 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.369
 I'm coming 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.430
 I do not see people and because I'm going to 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 I take rennie because I saw that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.780
 happens and I've made more mistakes because 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.540
 Where did I go from where I went? 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.820
 I caught leaving so stupid and thank you 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.380
 note the kick but I do now 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.400
 now it was already a motorcycle version there 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:41.190
 comparable to madness 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:46.230
 I do not think not liked 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:56.010
 Race does not like it because we see 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:03:01.800
 so will we send in Italy to me 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.540
 brought the first blew the old car 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:15.060
 Much to understand, I do not know. 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:19.970
 I also do not know, I do not know 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.970
 the ride picked up the checkpoint is on 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.140
 first the salt 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.850
 I think today the only one to win old 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.890
 that the only thing that is missing is a 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:49.830
 so to put pressure 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:54.690
 them is putting pressure on it is 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.239
 putting pressure on it comes to the store is 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.730
 I just thought it was cool, was it? 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.400
 was unnecessary and was 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.050
 The guy needed to press you like this. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.590
 it was something like that 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.320
 a boy is a good name 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.170
 So I said there, rest was not enough. 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.520
 and it does not impress he was 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:22.540
 going so well since the start of the race 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:25.240
 so running tchékhov river on the only island 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.580
 you run well despite the romance of 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.120
 a checkpoints like that - vadinho is 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.120
 but it's good 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:39.820
 there will leave more time in the race to a 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:44.310
 What the fuck is it like for you to see our 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.930
 face it in no time and why 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.810
 I do not know, I did not have space, it's only six 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.620
 hallways in a single day corridor by 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.560
 michael bay 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.560
 driving school talking
