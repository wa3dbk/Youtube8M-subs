everybody<00:00:09.750> Gary<00:00:09.990> Fung<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> we're<00:00:11.610> gonna

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
everybody Gary Fung here and we're gonna

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.190 
everybody Gary Fung here and we're gonna
go<00:00:11.910> into<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.150> series<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.630> how<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.960> do

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
go into a series about how to do

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.799 
go into a series about how to do
off-camera<00:00:13.980> flash<00:00:14.370> through<00:00:15.240> wireless

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
off-camera flash through wireless

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.540 
off-camera flash through wireless
systems<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> question<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.100> comes<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.400> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
systems but a question that comes up a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.420 
systems but a question that comes up a
lot<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.779> inexpensively<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.160> so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
lot is how to do it inexpensively and so

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.550 
lot is how to do it inexpensively and so
this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> probably<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.350> most

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this is probably the the most

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890 
this is probably the the most
inexpensive<00:00:23.039> setup<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.670> could<00:00:23.850> find<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.539> in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
inexpensive setup I could find here in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
inexpensive setup I could find here in
my<00:00:25.369> shop<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.529> little<00:00:28.529> Nikon<00:00:28.920> d3100

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
my shop and this is a little Nikon d3100

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.600 
my shop and this is a little Nikon d3100
I've<00:00:30.510> got<00:00:30.750> an<00:00:30.869> Olympus<00:00:31.320> flash<00:00:31.650> unit<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
I've got an Olympus flash unit here and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.540 
I've got an Olympus flash unit here and
watch<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.899> trigger<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
watch I can trigger it so that's the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
watch I can trigger it so that's the
really<00:00:35.820> cool<00:00:36.000> thing<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.420> these<00:00:37.079> really

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
really cool thing about these really

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.880 
really cool thing about these really
inexpensive<00:00:38.390> slave<00:00:39.390> units<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.739> can

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
inexpensive slave units is that you can

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.260 
inexpensive slave units is that you can
just<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.219> whatever<00:00:41.460> flash<00:00:41.850> you've<00:00:42.120> got

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
just take whatever flash you've got

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
just take whatever flash you've got
laying<00:00:42.510> around<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.079> stick<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> it'll

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
laying around and stick it on and it'll

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.020 
laying around and stick it on and it'll
fire<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.629> there's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.260> couple<00:00:46.940> there's<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
fire it now there's a couple there's a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
fire it now there's a couple there's a
reason<00:00:48.329> why<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.510> pay<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
reason why you pay so little one is that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.600 
reason why you pay so little one is that
this<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.840> TTL<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.340> problem

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this will not do TTL and the problem

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
this will not do TTL and the problem
with<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> now<00:00:55.829> put

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
with that is is that you have to now put

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
with that is is that you have to now put
the<00:00:56.160> flash<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.610> manual<00:00:57.090> manuals<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the flash on manual manuals not a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.619 
the flash on manual manuals not a
problem<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.070> subjects<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.640> moving<00:01:00.090> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
problem if your subjects not moving so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.569 
problem if your subjects not moving so
what<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:01.800> literally

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
what you would do is you would literally

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
what you would do is you would literally
put<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> say<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> know<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.530> half<00:01:04.799> power

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
put it on say you know one half power

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
put it on say you know one half power
one<00:01:05.369> eighth<00:01:05.519> power<00:01:05.760> full<00:01:06.060> power<00:01:06.090> whatever<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
one eighth power full power whatever you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840 
one eighth power full power whatever you
want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> bunch<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> test

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
want to do and then take a bunch of test

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.320 
want to do and then take a bunch of test
shots<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:10.350> subject<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.460> moving<00:01:11.939> too

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
shots with your subject not moving too

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.249 
shots with your subject not moving too
far<00:01:12.540> away<00:01:12.659> from<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.260> flash<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.979> then<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
far away from the flash and then the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.780 
far away from the flash and then the
other<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.830> won't<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.610> won't

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
other thing that it won't do is it won't

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.179 
other thing that it won't do is it won't
do<00:01:17.909> high<00:01:18.090> speed<00:01:18.150> sync<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.710> stuck<00:01:19.979> at

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
do high speed sync so you are stuck at

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.490 
do high speed sync so you are stuck at
one<00:01:20.340> 180th<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.090> second<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.689> 250th<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
one 180th of a second one 250th of a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
one 180th of a second one 250th of a
second<00:01:22.890> whatever<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> problem

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
second whatever now that's not a problem

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.679 
second whatever now that's not a problem
