00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.440
 for carlitos expenses invites you to 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.770
 banquet of humility looks d'alessio 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.230
 I'm meeting with my friends one or 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.530
 twice a week and we join in 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.750
 the neighborhood 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.990
 and you know my friends will not let me 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 nothing 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.560
 I was a graduate degree ago 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.000
 and I think three have jobs 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.810
 and every time I heard 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 that sorry 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.239
 that 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.239
 that both surprises that 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.309
 for that, nothing changed and for me 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.109
 neither and continuing with the just I have 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.479
 100 mango from here end of the month and it turns out 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.059
 I'm spending 50 because my friend is coming 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.729
 that she is doing very well to have lunch with friends or 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.850
 total after he goes what he tells on TV 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.590
 and we are all happy strong apache the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.210
 neighbors the first salaries for the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.399
 family and then the rotation by 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.680
 different clubs around the world including their 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.470
 step by england where he acquired the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.960
 popular habit of the gulf now let's continue 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 understanding this moving framework of 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.810
 pancho with mustard coming from mud and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.869
 Street 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.869
 the burning of africa is at 45 10 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.860
 yes 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 yes 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.820
 in formosa is where we stopped 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.820
 it is a hotel of 53 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.590
 they told me when I was barely there 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 very impacted because you imagine that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.920
 I put a 5 star hotel in the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.060
 middle of strong apache 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.780
 and the poverty that there is in formosa 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.860
 very very large is very large and very 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.700
 big 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.930
 suddenly we enter a large wall 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.930
 and we entered the hotel 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.030
 Las Vegas' 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.520
 the candles with almost and not everything 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.450
 and that wall exit and the people 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.330
 I was starving when the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.840
 world is 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.960
 and I think that we do not have to give 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.210
 account for those things because you can not 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.880
 live like this because the kids do not know 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.810
 they deserve those things we have 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.310
 to give an account and be able to act with something 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.420
 minimal because it's easy for us 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.420
 it's easy to help
