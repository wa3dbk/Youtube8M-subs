00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.339
 lex yes good evening I would like to say 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.350
 man but of course it is none at all 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 good evening because a two in one robot 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.400
 coupe du which the net also say the ruben 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.500
 yes those are numbers that you don't want to see 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.230
 end of occasionally of course not 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 definitely not sure not at home but yes 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.610
 yes what should I say the game 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.860
 summarized 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.290
 simply fun played the whole 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.020
 match up to 16 meters and one 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.650
 by there it was sufficient guess 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.630
 me and yes we are almost not in the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.220
 been problems despite it or 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.300
 two goals against you can already see it 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.370
 level of chapeler's 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.410
 yes that is crew and their lesson in 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.280
 you always hear effectiveness 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.930
 such a match 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.809
 well i think i think the first one 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.500
 cozy corner that it very unhappy 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.940
 corner of a crazy goal and that 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.070
 brings the same in the 13 minutes 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.810
 that flash with on a match think like 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.520
 you couldn't resist it was it 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.990
 first moment of them 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.730
 that their for me also actually came with 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.670
 a corner and if you do this that could 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.410
 I don't think so 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 one and come for because we are 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.009
 here is 13 minutes we are a lot 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.619
 better than them 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.030
 we started printing a second half 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.920
 upstairs groin 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.020
 coupons for one are way on the side 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.310
 and the mobile actually wants that for me 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.810
 we indicate 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.020
 is changed direction again in pussy 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.270
 ago and yes above what in the short corner well 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.810
 I just say it was an accident for three years 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.159
 what we what we have in Europe and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.960
 in the end 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 then again with the in two in defeat 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.780
 I should next istanbul now 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 now I had to go to that standard situation 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.140
 think of a story of one 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.310
 a few years ago at julia when the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.810
 some with response to one too 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.880
 has designated as the man who was 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.590
 standard situations drop everything 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.259
 he is also in that context 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.060
 yes so important that he is there 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.979
 you missed board or are those tasks 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.259
 redistributed that is not entirely true 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 say location to drop everything at 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.340
 corners and we just want something 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.920
 changes at the corners and beyond that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.500
 I'd have to stark all of them comprehensively 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.729
 to bang corner the ball is just going 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.229
 just going accidents goes through the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.849
 someone's shoulder goes up for me 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.830
 this corner in one 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.040
 his channel is the mini more and it has to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.410
 well solve yourself then you will get it 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.840
 yes that which penalty is the flow 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.000
 or do you see it as us is more than that 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.299
 really like that can come good 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.760
 well with goals really very little it takes 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.950
 for the outside world for the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.420
 statistics it 's just it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.670
 finally score and have to twice 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.420
 We also just do it twice or it 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 well we 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.610
 2021 is where must be twice anyway 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.140
 and after being aware if you do that 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.670
 does not then it is finished 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.349
 but is also something we can hold on to 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.700
 love hey who that chance is there 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.260
 that feyenoord succeeds because in you 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.900
 first analysis use the term we 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.160
 football and nice that that's on this 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.290
 level of course not enough to be there 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.060
 ff with two goals difference don't press 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.950
 certainly not sure not I know that magic 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.019
 what to rick in a cauldron with 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.910
 the 71 to 80,000 people believe in 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.410
 to me there it is very little 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.810
 I have no impression of people on it 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.180
 the stand there so so we just have to 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.769
 the football show what's going on today 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.790
 have shown only i think we 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.409
 a little bit more 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.140
 yes have to breed a little more danger 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.000
 and especially in the front , we need something with it 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.159
 must create something with opportunity 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.870
 if we do not then go to our 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.239
 we also very difficult to follow 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.069
 after all, scoring will come after this evening 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.170
 see that there is indeed real reinforcement 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.819
 in the arrive to must must come to 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.430
 your group 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.620
 absolutely marriage have 6 boys five 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.450
 boys and if you surrender one 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.680
 someone gets back for then like that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.329
 is not enough 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.920
 and today we make a 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.569
 television reportage for coming Friday 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.030
 then you train us as a guest at 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.760
 our football talk show fc rijnmond 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.900
 can you already specify a little what it 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.609
 difference is in his method 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.500
 relative to van ronald koeman or or 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.419
 will he be further away my that is possible 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.739
 of course also 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.930
 but not much is changed 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.159
 you would not also like the playing method 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.629
 he tries the same line I hour 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.650
 he tries to continue because we 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.720
 occurred the year before 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.269
 we have just performed well find 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.069
 me and yes then someone will train one like 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.650
 he won't just change it but 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.040
 the approach is that different and everyone 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.569
 So has its own approach so it has 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.150
 there is no difference either 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.709
 both a different type of person than on the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.430
 is in difference in understand I have you 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.010
 words 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.690
 of course there is a difference luckily 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.830
 not everyone is the same 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.860
 then that is the world it all 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.590
 I looked like that myself, but yes 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.180
 who who who who is something more should 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.699
 say that is something more self at the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.699
 it was a practice last year too 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.050
 koeman who just looked at your subjects 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.169
 What happened 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.729
 he is a little more successful there himself 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.889
 directions next week for the miracle 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.699
 from istanbul so we hope it will be over 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.699
 thank you
