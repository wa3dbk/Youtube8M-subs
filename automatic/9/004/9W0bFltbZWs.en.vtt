00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.300
 How do you feel after Frieder Schilling's performance on Saturday? 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.939
 for solutions 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.939
 Carinthia have 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.679
 how are you going to change? 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.029
 Holzmann will 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.029
 There are many good ones 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.840
 Asia Bellinger precipitation in almost 500 Henze upset 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.080
 there is overturned I know that even before 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.080
 say you have me around 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.150
 they had the impression before the purchase that they have one here 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.720
 stronger opponents 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.580
 stand opposite 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.920
 but that will be a good sign that they are 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.900
 against Oscar Bronner Wehner 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.430
 fought or was that the precursor what you las about them 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.480
 Now 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 want to hang the gloves on the nail 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 i found them better in the second round i have to tell them that now in the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.350
 moment 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 I thought it was better because there they have something silly why 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 See silence 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.410
 for her smile is also a piece 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.700
 So we ask another question if you do not want answers 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.020
 but maybe the weight difference is too big 18 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.200
 the ACE difference was not that big either 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.590
 Ladies 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 may you allow me another question, I hope for an answer 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.360
 what are you going to do next boxing they went on to America they would 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.430
 again actor 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 or how it turned out 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.520
 I thank you for this conversation 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.530
 that was lovely 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.430
 I also use it to the delight of the previous speaker 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.350
 whether sports and friendly overestimates Munich dapd 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.930
 that's why we have good tonight too 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 a lot of our airtime with boxing areas and that was the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.750
 reason
