done<00:02:13.990> bad<00:02:14.230> things<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:16.390> say<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:16.900> it's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
done bad things to it if you say so it's

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.370 
done bad things to it if you say so it's
sibling<00:02:18.340> rivalry<00:02:19.090> with<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.660> couple<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.110> deaths

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
sibling rivalry with a couple of deaths

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.200 
sibling rivalry with a couple of deaths
and<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.890> few<00:02:21.130> Wars<00:02:21.430> thrown<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.970> for<00:02:22.150> good

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
and a few Wars thrown in for good

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.740 
and a few Wars thrown in for good
measure

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
measure

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.020 
measure
you<00:02:23.740> can<00:02:24.010> see<00:02:24.250> where<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.520> money's<00:02:24.820> being

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
you can see where the money's being

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:34.550 
you can see where the money's being
spent<00:02:25.150> though<00:02:25.600> ten<00:02:26.350> out<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.530> ten<00:02:26.890> for<00:02:27.250> effects

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.050 

so<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.800> certainly<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.370> treat<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.970> eyes

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
so it's certainly a treat for the eyes

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.140 
so it's certainly a treat for the eyes
especially<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.500> scenes<00:02:38.770> with<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> naked<00:02:39.370> mr.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
especially the scenes with a naked mr.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
especially the scenes with a naked mr.
