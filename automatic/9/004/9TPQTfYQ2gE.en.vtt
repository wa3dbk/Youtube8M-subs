00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.320
 passers-by 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 the reason a campaign to launch 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 cellular telephony for which not only 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.420
 they turned the huge tower of 120 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 meters high on a huge screen 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.400
 but they covered with vinyl plates 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989

 maximum power projectors 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.530
 existing in the world and placed it

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.290
 the result generate images in four 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.030

 course paying a million dollar investment

 so far incalculable but that only 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280
 giving a clue to calculate its value 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.980
 it is enough to know that the system is charged 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.270
 foot or per square meter although you 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.670
 do not believe the national sport 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.350
 Argentine is not soccer, that's why in that

 two dancers and a ball 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.010

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.930
 principal of a campaign that seeks 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.090

 beautiful 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.030
 This is a wise advice and more if it comes

 comfortable consultation and a tour of the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.340
 good taste prevents certain sins that 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.930
 they should not be committed when a woman 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.340
 put on a tight jeans or trousers 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.560

 panty or you see it also when it starts 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.120
 buttock that's terrible that's fatal 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.670
 because the mini or is the neckline but not 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.269
 the two things and above all recommended 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.190
 the doses suitable for every occasion the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.950
 flavor of project 1 the famous group of 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.239

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.150
 Stay here 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.860
 it's basically the story or the story 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.530
 of a man who basically loses the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.760
 love of his life that he has next to a 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.650
 subject that is in the first places 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.870
 of the billboard that sounds on all 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.630
 rumba sites and that as he says is 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.630
 loaded with sparkle flavor and Latin rhythm 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.139
 Y 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.479
 in the video magic one acts with the ex 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.880
 miss venezuela lakshmi rodríguez a 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.860
 reason to watch it and enjoy it who 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.110
 we live the 80 we remember with special 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.180
 I affect the radio since then and about 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.010
 all some characters like papuchi 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.110
 caricature created by when alberto 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.180
 real a man to whom life took him 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.580
 to combine radio and laughter as 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.979
 discipline and as teaching I am I 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.990
 but I was born in bogotá because my parents 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.669
 they studied here when the time comes 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.590
 the university I still live again 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.229
 resigned the house of my cousin Alexander 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.240
 villalobos and moving away in that year 87 is 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.360
 starting on the radio because you're 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 as starting to conform that idea of 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.930
 radio disc-jockey radio with 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.479
 morning show on that accompanied the station 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.620
 it appears from wool paper suddenly very 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.270
 full very full 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.639
 returning to promote his music in the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.610
 stations so to execute me 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.219
 and my mask and it became my brand 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.430
 and he was given the opportunity as a creative 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.900
 to make steel that will ensure that the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.199
 informal interview so that's why the 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.199
 half 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.419
 so I had to invent a way to 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.009
 mom legallo to the people in front and so 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.490
 the 'united hands' their entire structure 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:06.379
 but a primíparo of journalism life 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.559
 sometimes not braked as he gets 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.559
 a shake and he says there's something else apart 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:15.469
 of his success and his joy there is something more 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.300
 in this life when you slow it down 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.279
 it slows you down and I get a spill 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.129
 brain as it survives as it surpasses 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.470
 the critical moment as such of the infarct 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:28.480
 cerebral 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:31.000
 and I let him go, I wanted to say goodbye 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.000
 whatever it was the training the 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.550
 process to recover the classroom the faith the 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.510
 attitude and the therapies took me 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.610
 ahead 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.650
 efe in that in which the miracle was already 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.710
 given and played wait your moment for 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.010
 to give an attitude to say I'm not 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.080
 defeated and failed or fallen but I 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.730
 I can lift and follow and the therapies 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.920
 because they are the discipline of the human being 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:57.310
 what the neuron needs to see 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.960
 how far because among other the 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.370
 doctors and scientists say that 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.240
 the brain damage is repaired 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.240
 irreversible 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.680
 and a talk called the one that laughs 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.330
 last render better 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.100
 I am daringly preparing a 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.169
 conference without being able to talk but 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.030
 that attitude and that faith led me to believe 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.570
 that someday I was going to be able to do that 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.800
 it's really a new format 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.960
 called radio conference because I that 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.610
 I did was bring my radio to the 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.199
 audiences then it's not a 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.820
 master conference with a powerpoint 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:36.640
 and a lectern 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.250
 but a radio program in an auditorium and 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.240
 The theme of the day is laughter, joy and 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.340
 good sense of humor as 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.840
 life tool and there developed 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.990
 a series of concepts about how 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:50.249
 live cool relaxed and hakuna radio 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.960
 kill a way of being 

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:55.719
 hakuna matata 

00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:01.749
 nothing but 

00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:01.749
 without worrying is how to live 

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:07.550
 live like this 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.110
 since it abbreviates 

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.110
 once behind
