you're<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> know<00:01:46.500> what's<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.250> got

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you're going to know what's up you got

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're going to know what's up you got
the<00:01:47.549> big<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:48.420> clock<00:01:48.780> looking<00:01:49.140> thing<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.680> big

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the big like clock looking thing the big

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
the big like clock looking thing the big
clock<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.670> above<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.270> really

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
clock at I'm above you really

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.039 
clock at I'm above you really
cool-looking<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:53.360> think<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> fits<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> monk

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
cool-looking I think it fits the monk

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.289 
cool-looking I think it fits the monk
scene<00:01:55.259> pretty<00:01:55.439> well<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.969> from<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.149> I've

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
scene pretty well and from what I've

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.200 
scene pretty well and from what I've
seen<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.899> definitely<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.210> mid-tier

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
seen is definitely one of the mid-tier

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.740 
seen is definitely one of the mid-tier
in<00:02:00.450> terms<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.960> quality<00:02:01.170> looking<00:02:02.060> level<00:02:03.060> 100

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
in terms of quality looking level 100

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.740 
in terms of quality looking level 100
talents<00:02:04.290> alright

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.230 

next<00:02:11.750> one<00:02:11.840> we're<00:02:11.960> taking<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.350> look<00:02:12.500> at<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.830> G

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
next one we're taking a look at is G

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.610 
next one we're taking a look at is G
explosion<00:02:14.240> look<00:02:14.390> at<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.630> style<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.380> down

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
explosion look at this style just down

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.890 
explosion look at this style just down
is<00:02:15.920> that's<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:16.760> good<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.060> ridiculous

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
is that's it's so good it's ridiculous

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.050 
is that's it's so good it's ridiculous
alright<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.410> can<00:02:18.530> take<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.710> look<00:02:18.800> at<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.070> it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
alright so we can take a look at it it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.730 
alright so we can take a look at it it
says<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.510> 40<00:02:20.870> yard<00:02:20.960> range<00:02:21.230> which<00:02:21.530> is

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
says it's a 40 yard range which is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.120 
says it's a 40 yard range which is
pretty<00:02:21.920> ridiculous<00:02:22.130> enough<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:23.780> there's<00:02:23.960> a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
pretty ridiculous enough but there's a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.550 
pretty ridiculous enough but there's a
multiple<00:02:25.130> layers<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.760> difference<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:27.110> how

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
multiple layers of difference in how

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.690 
multiple layers of difference in how
much<00:02:27.740> cheese<00:02:27.950> spend<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.370> we're<00:02:28.460> going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.640> go

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
much cheese spend so we're going to go

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.120 
much cheese spend so we're going to go
through<00:02:28.850> quite<00:02:29.630> succinctly<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.410> basically

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
through quite succinctly I basically

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.700 
through quite succinctly I basically
consumes<00:02:31.730> up<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.060> 42<00:02:33.020> cos<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.350> target<00:02:33.620> to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
consumes up to 42 cos the target to

consumes up to 42 cos the target to

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
explode with Chi energy housing is the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.260 
explode with Chi energy housing is the
additional<00:02:37.070> effects<00:02:37.430> all<00:02:37.610> right<00:02:37.730> when<00:02:38.180> you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
additional effects all right when you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.750 
additional effects all right when you
use<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:38.660> cheat<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.320> deals<00:02:39.560> nature<00:02:39.980> damage<00:02:40.310> per

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
use one cheat it deals nature damage per

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.580 
use one cheat it deals nature damage per
chi<00:02:41.000> consumed<00:02:41.450> always<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:42.440> a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
chi consumed always this is like a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.260 
chi consumed always this is like a
layers<00:02:42.920> off<00:02:43.190> for<00:02:43.430> these<00:02:43.610> things<00:02:43.790> after<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.180> do

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
layers off for these things after you do

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.410 
layers off for these things after you do
for<00:02:44.510> okay<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.960> chi<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:46.310> gain<00:02:46.520> cha<00:02:46.760> file<00:02:47.030> for

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
for okay to chi you gain cha file for

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.330 
for okay to chi you gain cha file for

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
each G consumed and three Chi it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.460 
each G consumed and three Chi it
purifies<00:02:52.370> all<00:02:52.850> staggered<00:02:53.510> average<00:02:53.840> what<00:02:54.230> this

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
purifies all staggered average what this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.580 
purifies all staggered average what this
is<00:02:54.620> ridiculous<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.340> then<00:02:55.670> for<00:02:56.000> Chi<00:02:56.590> damages

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
is ridiculous and then for Chi damages

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.310 
is ridiculous and then for Chi damages
all<00:02:58.030> targets<00:02:59.030> within<00:02:59.180> eight<00:02:59.540> yards<00:03:00.020> right<00:03:00.170> so

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
all targets within eight yards right so

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.540 
all targets within eight yards right so
don't<00:03:00.440> forget<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.860> first<00:03:01.100> cheat<00:03:01.400> we

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
don't forget in the first cheat we

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.520 
don't forget in the first cheat we
learned<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:02.300> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> do<00:03:02.630> /<00:03:02.900> cheese<00:03:03.230> so

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
learned that's going to do / cheese so

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.290 
learned that's going to do / cheese so
this<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.160> potential<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.670> do<00:03:04.790> some<00:03:05.000> serious

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
this is a potential to do some serious

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.440 
this is a potential to do some serious
damage<00:03:05.740> clear<00:03:06.740> your<00:03:06.890> stagger<00:03:07.370> which<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.820> what

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
damage clear your stagger which is what

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.780 
damage clear your stagger which is what
mind<00:03:08.780> blowing<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.860> gain<00:03:10.040> shuffle<00:03:10.700> you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
mind blowing and you gain shuffle you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.550 
mind blowing and you gain shuffle you
know<00:03:10.880> what<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.000> mean<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.540> replaces<00:03:12.110> black<00:03:12.350> up

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
know what I mean this replaces black up

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.370 
know what I mean this replaces black up
kick<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.130> argued<00:03:13.730> oak<00:03:14.030> Westar<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.720> nor<00:03:14.959> one

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
kick and is argued oak Westar is nor one

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.330 
kick and is argued oak Westar is nor one
of<00:03:15.440> my<00:03:15.500> time<00:03:15.650> right<00:03:15.769> there<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:16.040> no<00:03:16.190> argument

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
of my time right there is no argument

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.729 
of my time right there is no argument
this<00:03:16.580> is<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.000> best<00:03:17.180> well<00:03:17.930> there<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.350> no<00:03:18.560> way

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
this is the best well there is no way

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.800 
this is the best well there is no way
that<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.280> not<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.459> best<00:03:19.760> one<00:03:19.910> we'll<00:03:20.690> see

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
that this is not the best one we'll see

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.570 
that this is not the best one we'll see
about<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.110> magic<00:03:21.260> won<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.950> final<00:03:22.250> one<00:03:22.370> but

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
about the magic won the final one but

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.670 
about the magic won the final one but
this<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.540> ridiculous<00:03:23.720> all<00:03:24.320> right<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.590> we're

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
this is ridiculous all right so we're

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.770 
this is ridiculous all right so we're
going<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.860> take<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.980> look<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.420> cannot

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
going to take a look at it but I cannot

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.120 
going to take a look at it but I cannot
say<00:03:26.959> enough<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.440> don't<00:03:27.769> think<00:03:27.920> these<00:03:27.980> are

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
say enough I don't think these are

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.009 
say enough I don't think these are
properly<00:03:28.430> balanced<00:03:28.820> because<00:03:28.910> this<00:03:29.239> seems<00:03:29.450> way

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
properly balanced because this seems way

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.720 
properly balanced because this seems way
too<00:03:30.050> good<00:03:30.470> especially<00:03:30.800> since<00:03:31.190> monks<00:03:31.580> have

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
too good especially since monks have

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
of magic damage you don't really need to

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.340
