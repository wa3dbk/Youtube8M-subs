goes<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:10.770> immediately<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.960> kind

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
goes down immediately and that just kind

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
goes down immediately and that just kind
of<00:01:13.260> shows<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.220> strategy<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.000> it's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of shows the strategy I think it's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
of shows the strategy I think it's
actually<00:01:15.420> too<00:01:15.720> quick<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.970> there's<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> mean

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
actually too quick so there's the mean

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
actually too quick so there's the mean
shout<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> buy<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.710> turn<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
shout it's going to buy one turn with a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.160 
shout it's going to buy one turn with a
fake<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> battle<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.869> pretty

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
fake out and then the battle is pretty

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
fake out and then the battle is pretty
much<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.650> over<00:01:23.130> from<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.729> let's<00:01:23.939> go

much go be over from there so let's go

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
much go be over from there so let's go
I'd<00:01:24.240> actually<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.570> another<00:01:24.869> oh<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.070> dust<00:01:26.250> me

gonna<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> KO<00:01:38.400> from<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> frost

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
gonna be a KO from there so the frost

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690 
gonna be a KO from there so the frost
last<00:01:39.689> has<00:01:40.110> top<00:01:40.409> support<00:01:40.829> sets<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
last has top support sets up with the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.819 
last has top support sets up with the
frost<00:01:41.909> breath<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.320> sweet

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
frost breath and that's just sweet

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.090 
frost breath and that's just sweet
damage<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.060> Toros<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.320> one<00:01:46.560> quick

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
damage for the Toros so that's one quick

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
damage for the Toros so that's one quick
for<00:01:47.460> turn<00:01:47.670> battle<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.899> will

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
current anchor point props and you just

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.530 
current anchor point props and you just
make<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.280> where<00:02:42.550> frost<00:02:42.820> last<00:02:43.030> doesn't<00:02:43.390> have

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
make it where frost last doesn't have

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.630 
make it where frost last doesn't have
any<00:02:43.810> special<00:02:44.140> attack<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.680> Toros<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.460> enjoy

any special attack and Toros can enjoy

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.610 
any special attack and Toros can enjoy
the<00:02:45.790> hit<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.030> that's<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.270> one<00:02:46.420> shot<00:02:46.630> return<00:02:46.930> boom

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the hit so that's a one shot return boom

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.840 
the hit so that's a one shot return boom
just<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.070> then<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.490> go<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
just like that then you go for the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.700 
just like that then you go for the
earthquake<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.300> have<00:02:49.510> tongs<00:02:49.720> support<00:02:50.170> all

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
earthquake you have tongs support all

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.020 
earthquake you have tongs support all
the<00:02:50.860> earthquakes<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.430> gonna<00:02:51.610> be<00:02:51.730> too

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the earthquakes not gonna be too

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.190 
the earthquakes not gonna be too
effective<00:02:52.590> against<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:55.570> levitate<00:02:55.990> right

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
effective against the levitate right

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020 
effective against the levitate right
they're<00:02:56.380> super<00:02:57.070> effective<00:02:57.400> fire<00:02:57.640> blasts<00:02:57.970> so

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
they're super effective fire blasts so

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.520 
they're super effective fire blasts so
you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.240> also<00:02:58.390> run<00:02:58.630> tank<00:02:58.900> for<00:02:59.080> all<00:02:59.140> slabs<00:02:59.380> I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
you can also run tank for all slabs I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.460 
you can also run tank for all slabs I
guess<00:02:59.710> just<00:02:59.890> speed<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.000> hit<00:03:01.390> points<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
guess just speed and hit points to a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.970 
guess just speed and hit points to a
degree

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
degree

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.800 
degree
dusty<00:03:03.460> bombs<00:03:03.640> gonna<00:03:03.910> keep<00:03:04.090> frost<00:03:04.330> last<00:03:04.570> safe

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
dusty bombs gonna keep frost last safe

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.450 
dusty bombs gonna keep frost last safe
against<00:03:05.260> whatever's<00:03:05.590> going<00:03:05.830> on<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.130> Toros

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
against whatever's going on so Toros

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.970 
against whatever's going on so Toros
needs<00:03:07.030> use<00:03:07.270> return<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.140> house<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> key

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980

six then you use bullet punch and it
doesn't<00:04:23.919> matter<00:04:24.040> at<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.340> point<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:25.600> works

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
doesn't matter at that point that works

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.310 
doesn't matter at that point that works
