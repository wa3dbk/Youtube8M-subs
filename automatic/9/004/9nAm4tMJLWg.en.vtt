 and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.820
 to start 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.490
 the first thing is to preheat the oven to 400 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.950
 204 degrees fahrenheit or 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.770
 centigrade in a container we are going to 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.010
 make the flour the baking powder and the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.010
 Salt 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.810
 how am I using whole wheat flour what 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.030
 I'm left in the colander is the fiber of the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.990
 flour 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 something like that to try to be honey what 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.340
 I have left in the colander 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.580
 and I've already returned the added fiber because 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.880
 I want to use fiber in these cupcakes 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.840
 or Busquets 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.170

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.980
 and with your fingers we are going to crush like this 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.350
 trying to mix the flour 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.350

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.570
 flour with butter or with 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.509
 coconut oil 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.780
