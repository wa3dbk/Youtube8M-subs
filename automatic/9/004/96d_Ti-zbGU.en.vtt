00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
this is basically like the name says

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.269 
this is basically like the name says
jesse<00:00:16.630> skin<00:00:16.960> that<00:00:17.170> you<00:00:17.260> apply<00:00:17.529> on<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:17.770> front

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
jesse skin that you apply on the front

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.370 
jesse skin that you apply on the front
and<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.789> back<00:00:18.820> of<00:00:19.150> your<00:00:19.240> device<00:00:19.539> and<00:00:19.990> it<00:00:20.289> will

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
and the back of your device and it will

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.990 
and the back of your device and it will
provide<00:00:20.619> some<00:00:20.859> nice<00:00:21.010> grip<00:00:21.400> as<00:00:21.609> well<00:00:21.789> as<00:00:21.880> some

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
provide some nice grip as well as some

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.029 
provide some nice grip as well as some
scratch<00:00:22.270> protection<00:00:22.660> but<00:00:23.470> obviously<00:00:23.800> being

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
scratch protection but obviously being

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.339 
scratch protection but obviously being
so<00:00:24.279> thin<00:00:24.550> it<00:00:25.090> won't<00:00:25.300> provide<00:00:25.539> much<00:00:25.810> drop

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
so thin it won't provide much drop

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.650 
so thin it won't provide much drop
protection<00:00:26.590> so<00:00:27.220> as<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:27.939> can<00:00:28.029> see<00:00:28.269> does<00:00:28.480> say

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
protection so as you can see does say

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.480 
protection so as you can see does say
gelaskins<00:00:29.080> protection<00:00:29.590> with<00:00:29.710> style<00:00:29.949> not<00:00:30.189> bulk

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
gelaskins protection with style not bulk

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.310 
gelaskins protection with style not bulk
so<00:00:31.359> the<00:00:31.449> main<00:00:31.599> reason<00:00:31.900> why<00:00:31.990> you're<00:00:32.140> going<00:00:32.230> to

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.319 
so the main reason why you're going to
want<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.500> pick<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:32.710> up<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.219> for<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:33.969> design

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
want to pick this up is for the design

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.900 
want to pick this up is for the design
on<00:00:34.570> their<00:00:35.170> site<00:00:35.410> they<00:00:35.649> probably<00:00:35.920> have<00:00:36.190> 50<00:00:36.760> or

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
on their site they probably have 50 or

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.330 
on their site they probably have 50 or
60<00:00:37.270> maybe<00:00:37.450> even<00:00:37.660> more<00:00:37.840> designs<00:00:38.260> i<00:00:38.559> just<00:00:39.160> can

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
60 maybe even more designs i just can

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.010 
60 maybe even more designs i just can
through<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.579> few<00:00:39.879> of<00:00:39.910> them<00:00:40.059> and<00:00:40.480> here's<00:00:40.719> one<00:00:40.930> of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
through a few of them and here's one of

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.889 
through a few of them and here's one of
they<00:00:41.110> set<00:00:41.350> out<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.500> me<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.489> this<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.210> printed<00:00:43.750> on

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
they set out to me so this is printed on

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.920 
they set out to me so this is printed on
a<00:00:43.960> 3m<00:00:44.620> pad<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.640> one<00:00:46.030> thing<00:00:46.239> is<00:00:46.300> good<00:00:46.450> about<00:00:46.719> that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
a 3m pad so one thing is good about that

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.080 
a 3m pad so one thing is good about that
is<00:00:47.079> that<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.350> makes<00:00:47.500> it<00:00:47.710> reusable<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.910> if<00:00:49.000> you

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
is that it makes it reusable so if you

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.910 
is that it makes it reusable so if you
ever<00:00:49.180> want<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.510> use<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.020> case<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.530> put<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.680> screen

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
ever want to use a case and put a screen

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.740 
ever want to use a case and put a screen
protector<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.760> can<00:00:51.910> peel<00:00:52.120> these<00:00:52.239> off<00:00:52.480> put

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
protector you can peel these off put

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.450 
protector you can peel these off put
them<00:00:52.840> back<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.260> pad<00:00:53.440> right<00:00:53.649> there<00:00:53.680> and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
them back on the pad right there and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.490 
them back on the pad right there and
then<00:00:54.760> use<00:00:54.940> them<00:00:55.059> whenever<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.390> want<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.719> at

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
then use them whenever you want to at

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.410 
then use them whenever you want to at
the<00:00:56.590> same<00:00:56.770> time<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.340> that<00:00:57.520> three<00:00:57.789> material

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
the same time with that three material

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.420 
the same time with that three material
it'll<00:00:58.750> make<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.050> easy<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.469> apply<00:00:59.680> so<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.250> nice

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
it'll make it easy to apply so it's nice

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.479 
it'll make it easy to apply so it's nice
and<00:01:00.460> thick<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.480> won't<00:01:01.780> had<00:01:01.930> much<00:01:02.920> bowls<00:01:03.219> to

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
and thick so it won't had much bowls to

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.480 
and thick so it won't had much bowls to
it<00:01:03.609> so<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.540> just<00:01:04.570> slap<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.260> down<00:01:05.439> and<00:01:05.890> just

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
it so you just slap it down and just

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010 
it so you just slap it down and just
work<00:01:06.729> out<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.150> little<00:01:07.360> bit<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.570> bubbles<00:01:07.869> and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
work out the little bit of bubbles and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.390 
work out the little bit of bubbles and
the<00:01:08.080> creases<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.500> come<00:01:08.740> out<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.159> sides

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
the creases that come out on the sides

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.670 
the creases that come out on the sides
and<00:01:09.700> everything<00:01:10.659> will<00:01:10.840> look<00:01:10.930> smooth<00:01:11.350> and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
and everything will look smooth and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.520 
and everything will look smooth and
perfect<00:01:12.369> as<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.820> can<00:01:12.939> see<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.229> much

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
perfect as you can see so this is much

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.440 
perfect as you can see so this is much
much<00:01:14.740> easier<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:15.220> install<00:01:15.430> in<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.790> regular<00:01:16.150> skin

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
much easier to install in a regular skin

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.480 
much easier to install in a regular skin
just<00:01:17.020> because<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.409> is<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.680> much<00:01:17.830> thicker<00:01:18.189> and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
just because it is that much thicker and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.700 
just because it is that much thicker and
it<00:01:19.150> lays<00:01:19.360> down<00:01:19.570> really<00:01:19.840> evenly<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.560> real

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
it lays down really evenly and real

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.770 
it lays down really evenly and real
easily<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.180> main<00:01:22.299> reason<00:01:22.570> why<00:01:22.659> you're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
easily so the main reason why you're

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.359 
easily so the main reason why you're
going<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:22.960> want<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.170> pick<00:01:23.320> up<00:01:23.470> gelaskins<00:01:24.009> is

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
going to want to pick up gelaskins is

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.830 
going to want to pick up gelaskins is
because<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.820> design<00:01:25.150> on<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.420> back<00:01:25.450> as<00:01:25.810> you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
because the design on the back as you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.660 
because the design on the back as you
can<00:01:26.049> see<00:01:26.259> here<00:01:26.470> we<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.950> Nanami<00:01:27.340> cal

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
can see here we have the Nanami cal

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.940 
can see here we have the Nanami cal
droid<00:01:27.909> now<00:01:28.240> they<00:01:28.390> already<00:01:28.600> tell<00:01:28.840> for<00:01:28.990> 1495<00:01:29.619> so

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
droid now they already tell for 1495 so

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.340 
droid now they already tell for 1495 so
15<00:01:30.340> bucks<00:01:30.579> it's<00:01:31.180> definitely<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:31.689> little<00:01:31.960> steep

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
15 bucks it's definitely a little steep

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.560 
15 bucks it's definitely a little steep
but<00:01:33.040> when<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.670> think<00:01:33.880> about<00:01:33.939> it's<00:01:34.240> not<00:01:34.360> that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
but when you think about it's not that

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.710 
but when you think about it's not that
bad<00:01:34.720> because<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.710> can<00:01:35.979> reuse<00:01:36.220> them<00:01:36.579> so<00:01:36.939> over

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
bad because you can reuse them so over

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.690 
bad because you can reuse them so over
time<00:01:37.750> they<00:01:38.229> might<00:01:38.409> wear<00:01:38.650> off<00:01:38.829> but<00:01:39.100> 15<00:01:39.490> bucks

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
time they might wear off but 15 bucks

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.340 
time they might wear off but 15 bucks
really<00:01:40.180> isn't<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.479> lot<00:01:40.659> for<00:01:41.020> what<00:01:41.229> you're

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
really isn't a lot for what you're

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.109 
really isn't a lot for what you're
getting<00:01:41.680> which<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.310> nice<00:01:42.460> printed<00:01:42.880> design

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
getting which is a nice printed design

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.160 
getting which is a nice printed design
that<00:01:43.299> will<00:01:43.360> provide<00:01:43.630> some<00:01:43.930> scratch

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
that will provide some scratch

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.319 
that will provide some scratch
protection<00:01:44.560> at<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.829> same<00:01:45.009> time<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:46.060> one<00:01:46.210> thing

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
protection at the same time so one thing

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.240 
protection at the same time so one thing
I<00:01:46.420> like<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.049> design<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.530> clear<00:01:47.860> in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
I like is that the design is clear in

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.859 
I like is that the design is clear in
the<00:01:48.310> credit<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.880> can<00:01:49.030> see<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.600> destroyed

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
the credit as you can see it destroyed

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.569 
the credit as you can see it destroyed
scratch<00:01:50.380> protection<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.130> won't<00:01:51.310> scratch

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
scratch protection so this won't scratch

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.240 
scratch protection so this won't scratch
up<00:01:51.850> at<00:01:52.030> all<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.479> design<00:01:52.780> doesn't<00:01:52.990> even<00:01:53.250> fade

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
up at all the design doesn't even fade

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.609 
up at all the design doesn't even fade
or<00:01:54.460> anything<00:01:54.790> over<00:01:55.060> time<00:01:55.270> which<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.479> good<00:01:55.750> you

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
or anything over time which is good you

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.929 
or anything over time which is good you
do<00:01:56.740> have<00:01:56.799> some<00:01:56.979> nice<00:01:57.070> cut<00:01:57.369> outs<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.790> can

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
do have some nice cut outs as you can

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.270 
do have some nice cut outs as you can
see<00:01:58.180> for<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.840> camera<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.469> flash<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.070> the

see for the camera the flash and the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.550 
see for the camera the flash and the
speaker<00:02:00.759> one<00:02:01.390> thing<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.689> know<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.049> how<00:02:02.530> easy

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
speaker one thing to know is how easy

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.399 
speaker one thing to know is how easy
this<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.549> install<00:02:04.000> because<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.140> thin

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
this is to install because it is so thin

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.679 
this is to install because it is so thin
all<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:05.680> did<00:02:05.860> was<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.070> laid<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.460> down<00:02:06.610> by<00:02:07.420> using

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
all I did was I laid it down by using

all I did was I laid it down by using
the<00:02:08.110> camera<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.619> flash<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.670> adjust

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
the camera of the flash just to adjust

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.119 
the camera of the flash just to adjust
it<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.840> then<00:02:10.989> just<00:02:11.200> press<00:02:11.379> down<00:02:11.620> with<00:02:11.680> my<00:02:11.890> hand

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
going to get from this is very minimal

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.290 
going to get from this is very minimal
you're<00:02:23.400> going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.640> some<00:02:23.790> good<00:02:24.030> scratch

protection on the back this is basically
just<00:02:26.580> cosmetic<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.840> buttons<00:02:28.230> here<00:02:28.470> work<00:02:28.770> just

fine so that little piece there doesn't
interfere<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.910> buttons<00:02:39.240> at<00:02:39.420> all<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
interfere with the buttons at all at the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.600 
interfere with the buttons at all at the
top<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.620> i<00:02:40.680> said<00:02:40.980> those<00:02:41.130> cutouts<00:02:41.370> are

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
top like i said those cutouts are

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.730 
top like i said those cutouts are
perfect<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.150> no<00:02:42.300> worries<00:02:42.630> there<00:02:42.660> one<00:02:43.530> thing<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
perfect so no worries there one thing I

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.260 
perfect so no worries there one thing I
was<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:43.980> big<00:02:44.160> fan<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> amount<00:02:45.060> of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
was in big fan of was the amount of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.170 
was in big fan of was the amount of
actual<00:02:45.780> phone<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.040> left<00:02:47.280> up<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
actual phone that was left up here you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.540 
actual phone that was left up here you
do<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.510> lot<00:02:48.720> exposed<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.430> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
do have a lot exposed and so at the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.400 
do have a lot exposed and so at the
bottom<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.420> main<00:02:51.570> reason<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:51.959> because<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
bottom the main reason is because of the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
bottom the main reason is because of the
curves<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.830> phone<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.640> actual<00:02:54.000> material

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
curves of the phone the actual material

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.449 
curves of the phone the actual material
wouldn't<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.690> able<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.930> stay<00:02:55.350> down<00:02:55.590> because<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
wouldn't be able to stay down because it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.030 
wouldn't be able to stay down because it
is<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.730> curvy<00:02:57.150> around<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> sides<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.830> right

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
is so curvy around the sides but right

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.710 
is so curvy around the sides but right
here<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.459> see<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.209> cutouts<00:03:00.540> are

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
here you can see that the cutouts are

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
here you can see that the cutouts are
actually<00:03:01.110> perfect<00:03:01.650> until<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.430> done<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> good

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
actually perfect until it's done a good

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.890 
actually perfect until it's done a good
job<00:03:02.760> there<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.650> overall<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:04.800> 49<00:03:05.370> 50<00:03:05.910> i<00:03:06.209> think

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
job there and overall at 49 50 i think

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.780 
job there and overall at 49 50 i think
if<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.050> want<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.470> add<00:03:07.709> some<00:03:08.160> style<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.670> design
