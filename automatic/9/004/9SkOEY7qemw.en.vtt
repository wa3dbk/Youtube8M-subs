00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 to the girls and guys I hope they are 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.410
 super good good today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.450
 I bring a review of some products that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.420
 I had already shown them enough 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.420
 Personally time also I love and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 they are indelible lipsticks the brand is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.590
 scares me cosmetics the truth is 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.230
 very good and good I'll talk to you in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.539
 overall how is the product comes in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 a little tube so this is the tone 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 mocha and is the one that I put in the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.000
 lips the truth is that I love to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.390
 daily use and so 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.510
 they come in formats like gloss 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 and they have a smell I like chicle 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.200
 a lot as I say and well I these 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 products 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.750
 almost all I put to the test and good 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 proof that these happened was to last in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.570
 my classes as they possibly know me 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.250
 I am an instructor of zumba then good 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.260
 in a separate class that you are doing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.769
 exercise you are drinking water and things like that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.259
 and then not any lipstick lasts a lot 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.030
 I was looking for something of this type and I 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.800
 I came across earlier with some products that I 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.680
 disappointed but good and after 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.590
 we'll talk about that, there are also many 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.369
 tones these are only some that I 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 I have enough and still there are more and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.920
 aside they are very very economical they are 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.800
 around 20 pesos good in my 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 store are in 20 pesos surely 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.360
 can vary slightly according to the price 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 where you get it but in 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.800
 reality is a pretty product 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.229
 economic something that I can tell you of 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.539
 these products is that with some to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.720
 I had a hard time getting used to it 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.080
 to the application because good for 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.190
 start 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.200
 are lipsticks that are not moisturizing 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 can dry lips 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.370
 to me that the truth is that it is 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 indifferent because I with any 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.860
 lipstick that I use I always have to use 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.690
 first a balm that is something BONE 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.660
 the brand that is the labial always 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.030
 first I have to connect my lips 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.970
 then the truth is that I'm not interested 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.030
 a lot, I just tell them that I do it 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.760
 with all the lipsticks but how is 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.670
 indelible sometimes it's a bit difficult 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.320
 application with some products because 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.660
 If you wear a lot like you sometimes do not 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.900
 you get it to distribute well in the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.240
 lips like you have left the uneven 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.310
 tone is not darker than some 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.560
 parts where you could not blur 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.990
 well and so medium rare then you have to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.810
 take care not to grab much product by the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.020
 other side if you hold very little 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.540
 you have to go putting several layers and if 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.730
 you do not do it fast comes a moment in 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.280
 that you start to remove what you already 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.490
 you had down product and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.620
 also all weird then it's a little bit 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.250
 difficult to get used to applying them well 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.840
 because I personally had not used 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.480
 labial and indelible in this format 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.400
 before then it made me a little 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.319
 complicated as I tell you but now that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.290
 I got used to it, they make me products 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.690
 I totally recommend them magnificent 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.750
 and good I'll show you the tones 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.110
 from the lightest to the darkest 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.990
 the most neutral is this that I tell you those 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.630
 I'm going to teach you here 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.630
 is the mouth and it's like that the most 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.600
 neutral that I have no longer all have the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.650
 color but I will try to remember 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.750
 which are 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.790
 this was actually the first I had and 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:47.540
 the tone of the rosewood 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:51.680
 It's great is like that and good is like a 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.780
 bright pink cited good if you have like 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.959
 you shine something like that I do not know if they reach it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.620
 to distinguish I like a lot of fact 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.989
 here it looks a little in the tube it shows 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.470
 the brightness that has the following is 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.019
 this one of this I do not remember the tone but it's 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.630
 like a neon pink I do not know if they reach it 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.120
 watch 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.230
 and well it is quite noticeable that it is a color 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.360
 very striking 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.040
 there you can see it the other one sees a 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.040
 little more off than this one 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.700
 and I also like it a lot because apart 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.980
 I have a blue sweatshirt with some 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.260
 little pink details and combines super good 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.240
 with that lipstick in my opinion I 'm 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.240
 leaving a little of the subject but good 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.569
 then I have another rose that is this 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.759
 it's fuchsia 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.939
 This is darker how you can give 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.939
 account 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 that's more like pulling towards 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.660
 red but not so much I was 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.960
 forgetting one that is also more clear 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.770
 and it's an orange is this the truth 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.199
 I do not remember the tone either 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.289
 this in fact already practically I 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.940
 finish I do not know if you can teach them well the 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.520
 tone if it looks there is a clarito orange 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.080
 I really loved it, I used it a lot 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.470
 because I still have a shirt that is 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.000
 orange and every time I use it 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.849
 this lipstick I think that I am already 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.620
 ending seriously and good finally 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.400
 let's go to the reds 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.580
 the first one is this the tone is wine and it's 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.840
 a red very very father like it's like a 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.660
 burned red 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.890
 down here he taught them 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.890
 this is the tone 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.770
 and well he also knows that if you 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.620
 you put a little less you can see a 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.570
 little more natural is not as dark as 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.770
 the next one I'm going to teach you that 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:02.110
 it's this is the burnt red you see the tube 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.409
 it looks almost black it looks like it's a 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.539
 purple super or dark 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.689
 and in fact when you take them out you also 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.119
 see like this and when applying it 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:16.260
 is this way is a little more red 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:18.360
 dark than the previous 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.330
 and good the truth is that all these 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.280
 I love colors as you see there are many 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.300
 variety and these are just some there 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.790
 there are more reds like moraditos and there are more 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.120
 neutral tones but hey these are the 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.190
 that I have the moment are products 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.960
 that I really recommend you a lot if you 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.060
 they come to bump it because I never 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.500
 I had seen but well I decided to try 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.890
 one and the truth is that I do not 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.660
 they disappointed me I like them a lot 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.970
 but hey Now you if you dare to 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.710
 try them I recommend them but if 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.220
 they have tried them they are encouraged to try the 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.980
 You can leave your opinion below and 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.590
 well I think that at the moment that's 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.910
 all 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.190
 yes I hope that nothing has happened to me 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.290
 and good remember, I have a store 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.420
 online I have these available 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:12.380
 I'm going to leave the link here 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:17.260
 in the description box and then nothing 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.260
 see you in the next video bye
