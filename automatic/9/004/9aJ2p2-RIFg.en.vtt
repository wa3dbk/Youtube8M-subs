you<00:03:52.489> read<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.819> slant<00:03:53.239> because<00:03:54.230> it's<00:03:54.530> all

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
you read the slant because it's all

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.339 
you read the slant because it's all
slanted<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:55.519> that's<00:03:55.760> life<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.389> guess<00:03:56.959> we<00:03:57.170> live

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
slanted but that's life I guess we live

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:06.610 
slanted but that's life I guess we live
in<00:03:57.469> a<00:03:57.530> world<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.980> slants<00:03:58.670> and<00:04:05.409> that's<00:04:06.409> like

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
in a world of slants and that's like

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.979 
in a world of slants and that's like
these<00:04:06.829> eggs<00:04:07.069> I<00:04:07.370> make<00:04:07.849> you<00:04:07.969> do<00:04:08.239> my<00:04:08.389> ink<00:04:08.629> are<00:04:08.840> they

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
these eggs I make you do my ink are they

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.539 
these eggs I make you do my ink are they
incubating<00:04:09.469> their<00:04:09.560> eggs<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.980> course<00:04:10.040> not

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
incubating their eggs of course not

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.129 
incubating their eggs of course not
because<00:04:10.700> they<00:04:10.849> can<00:04:11.060> take<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.359> incubate<00:04:11.810> their

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
because they can take to incubate their

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.170 
because they can take to incubate their
eggs<00:04:12.230> in<00:04:12.530> our<00:04:13.010> cage<00:04:13.370> in<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:13.790> controlled

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
eggs in our cage in a controlled

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.890 
eggs in our cage in a controlled
environment<00:04:14.290> because<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.379> takes<00:04:15.590> 86<00:04:16.400> days<00:04:16.900> 84

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
days for them to hatch and that's just

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.060 
days for them to hatch and that's just
not<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.019> just<00:04:21.229> it's<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.500> too<00:04:21.650> much<00:04:21.889> it's

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
not it's just it's just too much it's

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.589 
not it's just it's just too much it's
just<00:04:22.280> hard<00:04:22.490> they<00:04:22.729> don't<00:04:22.759> do<00:04:23.030> very<00:04:23.060> well<00:04:23.300> with
