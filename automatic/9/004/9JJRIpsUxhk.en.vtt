00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.130 

I'm<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.820> rock<00:00:03.000> climber<00:00:03.240> I've<00:00:03.570> been<00:00:03.959> climbing

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I'm a rock climber I've been climbing

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.120 
I'm a rock climber I've been climbing
for<00:00:04.380> 14<00:00:05.069> years<00:00:05.250> since<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.029> was<00:00:06.210> 10<00:00:06.540> years<00:00:06.569> old

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
for 14 years since I was 10 years old

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.830 
for 14 years since I was 10 years old
primarily<00:00:08.130> sport<00:00:09.000> climbing<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.599> bouldering

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
primarily sport climbing and bouldering

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.530 
primarily sport climbing and bouldering
and<00:00:10.410> competition<00:00:11.130> climbing<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.150> climb

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and competition climbing you can climb

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.519 
and competition climbing you can climb
five<00:00:12.809> 14<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.549> doesn't<00:00:14.849> mean<00:00:14.940> anything

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
five 14 but that doesn't mean anything

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.810 
five 14 but that doesn't mean anything
when<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:16.740> ice<00:00:16.890> climbing<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:19.640> was<00:00:20.640> never

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
when you go ice climbing I was never

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.029 
when you go ice climbing I was never
really<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.180> winter<00:00:21.480> person<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.920> always

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
really a winter person and I always

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.310 
really a winter person and I always
hated<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> cold<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> kind<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.720> had<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> adapt

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
hated the cold so I kind of had to adapt

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960 
hated the cold so I kind of had to adapt
that<00:00:25.949> was<00:00:26.070> why<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.250> never<00:00:26.400> started<00:00:26.820> ice

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that was why I never started ice

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
that was why I never started ice
climbing<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> first<00:00:27.660> place<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
climbing the first place I think the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970 
climbing the first place I think the
only<00:00:29.070> way<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.400> safely<00:00:30.390> become<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.230> good<00:00:31.710> ice

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
only way to safely become a good ice

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.970 
only way to safely become a good ice
climber<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.700> having<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.510> good<00:00:33.719> mentor<00:00:34.500> who<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
climber is having a good mentor who you

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.569 
climber is having a good mentor who you
trust

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
trust

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.260 
trust
and<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> tried<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.579> way<00:00:38.790> ice

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and so I tried to be that in a way ice

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.750 
and so I tried to be that in a way ice
climbing<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:41.010> another<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
climbing is just another way to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.810 
climbing is just another way to
challenge<00:00:42.480> myself<00:00:43.010> mentally<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.219> climbing

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
challenge myself mentally in climbing

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.389 
challenge myself mentally in climbing
it's<00:00:45.090> also<00:00:45.620> fascinating<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.280> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it's also fascinating I think to be

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.340 
it's also fascinating I think to be
climbing<00:00:47.670> frozen<00:00:48.300> water<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.260> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
climbing frozen water it's kind of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
climbing frozen water it's kind of
counterintuitive<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> climbing

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
counterintuitive to be climbing

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.600 
counterintuitive to be climbing
something<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.739> tends<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> break<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
something that that tends to break and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.479 
something that that tends to break and
it's<00:00:54.180> sort<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> game<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:54.930> trust<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:56.370> have

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's sort of a game with trust you have

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.150 
it's sort of a game with trust you have
to<00:00:56.640> trust<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> ice<00:00:57.410> nice<00:00:58.410> brace

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.540

top rope while i was climbing it i was

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.550 
top rope while i was climbing it i was
like<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:10.479> no<00:01:10.570> way<00:01:10.840> I'm<00:01:10.990> gonna<00:01:11.200> leave<00:01:11.380> this

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
and I kind of like forgot how scary it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.760 
and I kind of like forgot how scary it
was<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.910> Sam<00:01:31.690> was<00:01:31.900> like<00:01:32.080> well<00:01:32.259> would<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.619> ever

lead<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.580> just<00:01:34.420> said<00:01:34.570> yes

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
lead it and I just said yes

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.570 
lead it and I just said yes
automatically<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:38.619> I<00:01:38.770> had<00:01:38.979> top<00:01:39.190> rope<00:01:39.430> to

Marble Falls last year and I remembered

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.889 
Marble Falls last year and I remembered
what<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.759> was<00:01:42.940> like<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.420> remembered<00:01:43.780> how

what it was like and I remembered how

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.109 
what it was like and I remembered how

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
beautiful it was and I made it a goal of

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.510 
beautiful it was and I made it a goal of
mine<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.750> lead<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.619> route<00:01:47.860> Oh<00:01:48.100> your<00:01:48.340> first

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
mine to lead that route Oh your first

mine to lead that route Oh your first
ruin<00:01:49.119> at<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.630> column<00:01:50.200> that's<00:01:50.380> above<00:01:50.680> your

ruin at the column that's above your

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.609 
ruin at the column that's above your
head<00:01:51.930> looks<00:01:52.930> pretty<00:01:53.200> good

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
head looks pretty good

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.760 
head looks pretty good
the<00:01:54.399> top<00:01:54.670> looked<00:01:55.180> really<00:01:55.660> thin<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.110> it

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
the top looked really thin and it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.859 
the top looked really thin and it
sounded<00:01:57.280> really<00:01:57.460> thin<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:58.060> when<00:01:58.539> I<00:01:58.570> finally

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
sounded really thin and when I finally

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.889 
sounded really thin and when I finally
got<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.140> there<00:01:59.380> on<00:01:59.440> lead<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:01.360> put<00:02:01.539> my<00:02:01.660> tools

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
got up there on lead and I put my tools

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.930 
got up there on lead and I put my tools
in<00:02:02.170> they<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:03.160> went<00:02:03.399> straight<00:02:03.490> through<00:02:03.700> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
in they just went straight through the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.450 
in they just went straight through the
ice<00:02:04.060> at<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.840> top<00:02:05.050> generally<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:05.800> it's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
ice at the top generally it's it's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.089 
ice at the top generally it's it's
really<00:02:06.700> thin<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.509> doable<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.110> say<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.649> today

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
really thin but doable and say and today

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.540 
really thin but doable and say and today
in<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.670> few<00:02:09.880> hours<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.330> we<00:02:10.420> were<00:02:10.539> there<00:02:10.599> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
in the few hours that we were there it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.370 
in the few hours that we were there it
deteriorated<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.700> being<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.720> like<00:02:13.840> paper

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
deteriorated to being just like paper

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.740 
deteriorated to being just like paper
thing<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.670> there<00:02:15.790> was<00:02:15.940> probably<00:02:16.150> like<00:02:16.330> three

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
thing and there was probably like three

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.260 
thing and there was probably like three
feet<00:02:16.959> between<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.500> ice<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.670> rock<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
feet between the ice and the rock and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.780 
feet between the ice and the rock and
the<00:02:19.569> ice<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.750> only<00:02:20.050> about<00:02:20.410> an<00:02:20.560> inch<00:02:20.709> thick<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
the ice is only about an inch thick and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.240 
the ice is only about an inch thick and
there<00:02:21.970> was<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.240> water<00:02:22.560> flowing<00:02:23.560> through<00:02:23.590> and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
there was like water flowing through and

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.070 
there was like water flowing through and
I<00:02:24.490> could<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:24.940> actually<00:02:25.270> look<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.750> there<00:02:25.990> were

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
I could like actually look in there were

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.980 
I could like actually look in there were
holes<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.650> was<00:02:26.740> kind<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.010> like<00:02:27.660> falling<00:02:28.660> apart

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
holes it was kind of like falling apart

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.070 
holes it was kind of like falling apart
I<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.470> had<00:02:29.590> visions<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.069> myself<00:02:30.490> like

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
I just had visions of myself like

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.240 
I just had visions of myself like
crashing<00:02:32.080> through<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.319> ice<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.860> falling

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
crashing through the ice and falling

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.339 
crashing through the ice and falling
down<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:34.450> behind<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.590> Icefall<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:37.349> don't

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
down like behind the Icefall I don't

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.690 
down like behind the Icefall I don't
think<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.590> can<00:02:38.739> do<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.970> I'm<00:02:39.970> too<00:02:40.239> scared

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 

I<00:02:44.760> mean<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.720> consequences<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.470> falling<00:02:47.040> when

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
I mean the consequences of falling when

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.550 
I mean the consequences of falling when
you're<00:02:47.340> ice<00:02:47.489> climbing<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.230> obviously<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> lot

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you're ice climbing is obviously a lot

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.710 
you're ice climbing is obviously a lot
more<00:02:49.739> severe<00:02:50.550> than<00:02:50.910> when<00:02:51.150> you're<00:02:51.330> sport

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
more severe than when you're sport

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.320 
more severe than when you're sport
climbing<00:02:51.870> above<00:02:52.620> bolts<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.430> fear<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.060> is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
climbing above bolts so the fear is is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.710 
climbing above bolts so the fear is is
definitely<00:02:57.900> more<00:02:58.050> real<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:59.360> always<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.540> these

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
definitely more real I always have these

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360 
definitely more real I always have these
like<00:03:00.930> visions<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.709> ice<00:03:01.890> just<00:03:02.250> like

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
like visions of the ice just like

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.880 
like visions of the ice just like
exploding<00:03:03.209> out<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.510> wall<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.989> me<00:03:04.620> like

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
exploding out of the wall and me like

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.100 
exploding out of the wall and me like
taking<00:03:05.220> these<00:03:05.310> horrendous<00:03:05.790> Falls<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.569> that's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
taking these horrendous Falls and that's

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.750 
taking these horrendous Falls and that's
what<00:03:07.349> scares<00:03:07.620> me<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.920> most<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.430> like

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
right in the ice they just have to learn

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.280 
right in the ice they just have to learn
buy<00:03:28.590> fuel<00:03:29.130> I've<00:03:30.090> never<00:03:30.510> taken<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.930> fall<00:03:31.110> ice

Oh

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:25.930 

I<00:04:22.270> was<00:04:23.270> definitely<00:04:23.449> afraid<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.490> knew<00:04:25.729> that

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
I was definitely afraid but I knew that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.200

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
relax and breathe and that I would

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.330 
relax and breathe and that I would
eventually<00:04:31.430> get<00:04:32.150> through<00:04:32.330> it

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.530 

is<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:38.910> really<00:04:39.120> not<00:04:39.540> like<00:04:40.200> really<00:04:40.890> calm
