00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
hi I'm Mike and today we're working at

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.000 
hi I'm Mike and today we're working at
2000<00:00:08.250> Honda<00:00:08.519> Accord<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.360> v6<00:00:09.570> engine<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.289> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
2000 Honda Accord with v6 engine and a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.799 
2000 Honda Accord with v6 engine and a
problem<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.369> we're<00:00:11.639> having<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.209> it<00:00:12.480> has<00:00:12.660> an

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
problem that we're having is it has an

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.039 
problem that we're having is it has an
engine<00:00:12.990> misfire<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.449> so<00:00:15.449> what<00:00:15.629> I<00:00:15.660> did<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:15.990> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
engine misfire and so what I did was I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.650 
engine misfire and so what I did was I
hooked<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> coal<00:00:16.890> scanner<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
hooked up the coal scanner to the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
hooked up the coal scanner to the
computer<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:19.949> telling<00:00:20.099> me

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
computer here and what it's telling me

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.850 
computer here and what it's telling me
is<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.730> tells<00:00:20.970> me<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.150> actually<00:00:22.110> all<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
is this tells me that actually all the

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.550 
is this tells me that actually all the
cylinders<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.520> misfiring

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
cylinders are misfiring

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.950 
cylinders are misfiring
if<00:00:25.560> long<00:00:26.630> hold<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.869> sec<00:00:29.630> it's<00:00:30.630> telling<00:00:30.930> me

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
if long hold on a sec it's telling me

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200 
if long hold on a sec it's telling me
that<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> cylinder<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.669> misfire

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that we have a cylinder one misfire

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.459 
that we have a cylinder one misfire
which<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> appeal<00:00:34.020> 301<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> cylinder

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
which is appeal 301 and then a cylinder

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.040 
which is appeal 301 and then a cylinder
2<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.710> misfiring<00:00:37.979> 3<00:00:38.850> bits<00:00:39.089> firing<00:00:39.479> and<00:00:39.659> down

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
2 is misfiring 3 bits firing and down

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.739 
2 is misfiring 3 bits firing and down
the<00:00:40.170> line<00:00:40.409> and<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:42.059> also<00:00:42.179> has<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.449> random

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
the line and it also has a random

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:47.779 
the line and it also has a random
misfire<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.109> show<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.760> how<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
misfire so I'm going to show you how to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.549 
misfire so I'm going to show you how to
detect<00:00:48.300> which<00:00:48.600> cylinder<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
detect which cylinder is actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.639 
detect which cylinder is actually
misfiring<00:00:50.659> also<00:00:51.659> if<00:00:51.839> you<00:00:51.960> check<00:00:52.199> engine<00:00:52.379> light

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
misfiring also if you check engine light

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.469 
misfiring also if you check engine light
is<00:00:52.679> flashing<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> clear

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
is flashing like this that's a clear

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.139 
is flashing like this that's a clear
indication<00:00:54.929> that<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.409> have<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.589> misfire<00:00:56.159> ok

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
indication that you have a misfire ok

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.699 
indication that you have a misfire ok
first<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> try<00:00:58.049> and<00:00:58.079> determine<00:00:58.469> which

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:58.709 
first up and try and determine which

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.229 
first up and try and determine which
cylinder<00:00:59.159> is<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.579> misfiring<00:00:59.999> what

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cylinder is actually misfiring what

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.759 
cylinder is actually misfiring what
you're<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.049> you<00:01:01.559> want

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
you're going to want to do is you want

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.469 
you're going to want to do is you want
to<00:01:01.829> expose<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.579> ignition<00:01:02.969> coil<00:01:03.209> and<00:01:03.389> the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
to expose the ignition coil and the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.050 
to expose the ignition coil and the
plugs<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.190> has<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.549> cover<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
plugs so this one has this cover here so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
plugs so this one has this cover here so
I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> remove<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.799> could<00:01:08.010> get

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
I'm going to remove it so it could get

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.050 
I'm going to remove it so it could get
to<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> connectors<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:11.610> pops<00:01:11.850> off

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
to the connectors on them just pops off

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.280 
to the connectors on them just pops off
like<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.660> process<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> I'm<00:01:19.230> going

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
like this and the process that I'm going

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.650 
like this and the process that I'm going
to<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> engine<00:01:20.310> running<00:01:20.510> is<00:01:21.510> I'm

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
to do is with the engine running is I'm

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.720 
to do is with the engine running is I'm
going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.870> disconnect<00:01:22.320> these<00:01:22.620> plugs<00:01:22.980> to<00:01:23.580> these

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
going to disconnect these plugs to these

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.560 
going to disconnect these plugs to these
ignition<00:01:24.240> coils<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:26.120> and<00:01:27.120> what

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
ignition coils one at a time and what

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.820 
ignition coils one at a time and what
I'm<00:01:27.690> looking<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.260> I'm<00:01:28.410> looking<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.800> a

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
I'm looking for is I'm looking for a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.360 
I'm looking for is I'm looking for a
change<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.790> engine<00:01:29.970> an<00:01:30.620> RPM<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:31.980> how<00:01:32.160> it

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
change in the engine an RPM and how it

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.420 
change in the engine an RPM and how it
feels<00:01:32.880> rough<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.510> on<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.800> doesn't<00:01:35.190> change

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
feels rough and on if it doesn't change

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.810 
feels rough and on if it doesn't change
then<00:01:35.910> that's<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.330> suspect<00:01:37.040> cylinder<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.700> let

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
then that's the suspect cylinder so let

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.250 
then that's the suspect cylinder so let
me<00:01:38.910> show<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.090> how<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:42.260> just

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
me show you how to do that just

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.830 
me show you how to do that just
connecting<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.800> plug<00:01:44.160> here

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
connecting this plug here

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.219 
connecting this plug here
rpm<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> engine

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.899 

so<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.770> one<00:01:50.920> made<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> change<00:01:51.460> but<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.759> know

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
so that one made a change but I know

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.200 
so that one made a change but I know
that<00:01:52.090> one's<00:01:52.270> good

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.200 

that<00:01:56.750> want<00:01:56.960> me<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.110> change

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.170 

this<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:02.990> one<00:02:03.170> which<00:02:03.620> I<00:02:03.880> disconnected<00:02:04.880> and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
this is the one which I disconnected and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.390 
this is the one which I disconnected and
there's<00:02:05.330> no<00:02:05.480> change<00:02:05.840> in<00:02:06.080> rpm<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:06.950> know<00:02:07.100> that

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
there's no change in rpm I know that

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.580 
there's no change in rpm I know that
this<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.820> specific<00:02:08.030> selling<00:02:08.929> grass<00:02:09.170> misfire

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this is a specific selling grass misfire

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
this is a specific selling grass misfire
now<00:02:11.130> once<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> determine<00:02:11.819> what<00:02:12.150> cylinder<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
now once you determine what cylinder is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.270 
now once you determine what cylinder is
misfiring<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.770> you're<00:02:13.890> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.100> want<00:02:14.250> to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
misfiring what you're going to want to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.470 
misfiring what you're going to want to
do<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.610> you're<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.880> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> take<00:02:15.330> these

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
do is you're going to want to take these

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.780 
do is you're going to want to take these
ignition<00:02:16.440> coils<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.370> swap<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.760> with

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
ignition coils out and swap it with

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.400 
ignition coils out and swap it with
another<00:02:18.120> cylinder<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.260> was

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
another cylinder that you know that was

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500 
another cylinder that you know that was
good<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:20.700> case<00:02:20.910> I'm<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.300> switch

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
good so in this case I'm going to switch

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.630 
good so in this case I'm going to switch
these<00:02:21.780> two<00:02:22.080> here<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
these two here and then I'm going to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.870 
these two here and then I'm going to
redo<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.540> procedure<00:02:25.319> again<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.610> if<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
redo the procedure again and then if the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.660 
redo the procedure again and then if the
problem<00:02:27.300> transfers<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.610> know

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
problem transfers to here that I know

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.729 
problem transfers to here that I know
that<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> ignition<00:02:30.600> coil<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:30.989> bad<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.590> means

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
that the ignition coil is bad that means

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.500 
that the ignition coil is bad that means
the<00:02:31.800> spark<00:02:32.069> plug<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.459> good<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> ECM<00:02:33.360> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the spark plug is good and the ECM is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.350 
the spark plug is good and the ECM is
doing<00:02:33.750> its<00:02:33.989> job<00:02:34.610> now<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.880> determine

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
doing its job now that you determine

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.790 
doing its job now that you determine
which<00:02:36.510> cylinder<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.050> misfiring<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.680> you're

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
which cylinder is misfiring what you're

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.020 
which cylinder is misfiring what you're
going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.280> you're<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.819> swap

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
going to do is you're going to swap

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.580 
going to do is you're going to swap
these<00:02:39.180> ignition<00:02:39.660> coils<00:02:39.989> that's<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.440> easy

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
these ignition coils that's really easy

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
these ignition coils that's really easy
to<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.800> what<00:02:41.370> you're<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.640> want<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.819> do<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
to do what you're going to want to do is

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.820 
to do what you're going to want to do is
unplug<00:02:42.930> them<00:02:43.470> like<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.750> then<00:02:46.530> take

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
unplug them like this and then take

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.770 
unplug them like this and then take
these<00:02:47.040> six<00:02:47.580> millimeter<00:02:48.180> socket<00:02:48.630> head<00:02:48.720> cap

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
these six millimeter socket head cap

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.000 
these six millimeter socket head cap
screws<00:02:49.290> out

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.410 

let<00:02:59.010> me<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.310> swap<00:02:59.519> them<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.850> pull<00:03:00.060> straight

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
let me just swap them they pull straight

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.270 
let me just swap them they pull straight
out<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.890 

I<00:03:12.730> put<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.819> screws<00:03:14.060> back<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.510> there

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
I put the screws back in there

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.080 
I put the screws back in there
even<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:15.620> testing<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.310> because<00:03:16.880> when<00:03:17.060> I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
even on just testing it because when I

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.050 
even on just testing it because when I
unplug<00:03:17.660> these<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.140> don't<00:03:18.350> want<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.400> want

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
unplug these I don't want to so I want

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.340 
unplug these I don't want to so I want
to<00:03:20.090> make<00:03:20.209> sure<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.420> connection<00:03:20.810> stays<00:03:21.080> good

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
to make sure the connection stays good

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:32.920 
to make sure the connection stays good
and<00:03:21.560> solid<00:03:31.090> okay<00:03:32.090> now<00:03:32.270> I'm<00:03:32.360> going<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.600> restart

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and solid okay now I'm going to restart

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.920 
and solid okay now I'm going to restart
the<00:03:33.080> engine<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:35.150> I'm<00:03:35.270> going<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.450> repeat<00:03:35.780> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
the engine and I'm going to repeat the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:48.030 
the engine and I'm going to repeat the
test<00:03:36.170> again

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.670 

okay<00:03:48.970> now<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> 100%<00:03:49.900> share<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
okay now a 100% share that is the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.530 
okay now a 100% share that is the
ignition<00:03:50.950> coil<00:03:51.340> because<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.819> swapped<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.299> and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
ignition coil because I swapped it and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.660 
ignition coil because I swapped it and
the<00:03:52.959> problem<00:03:53.379> did<00:03:53.620> move<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.129> this<00:03:54.400> cylinder

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
the problem did move to this cylinder

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.479 
the problem did move to this cylinder
here<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.170> know<00:03:56.349> that<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.769> ignition<00:03:57.099> coil

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
here so I know that this ignition coil

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.229 
here so I know that this ignition coil
is<00:03:57.640> bad<00:03:57.879> I'm<00:03:58.090> going<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.329> replace<00:03:58.689> it<00:03:58.750> I<00:04:00.120> got<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
is bad I'm going to replace it I got the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.839 
is bad I'm going to replace it I got the
new<00:04:01.390> part<00:04:01.659> here<00:04:01.689> in<00:04:01.959> my<00:04:02.079> hand<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.590> go<00:04:03.459> ahead

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
new part here in my hand and go ahead

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.569 
new part here in my hand and go ahead
and<00:04:04.030> swap<00:04:04.239> them<00:04:04.390> out<00:04:05.099> so<00:04:06.099> now<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.489> know

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
and swap them out so now that I know

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:38.490 
and swap them out so now that I know
which<00:04:06.819> one<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> bad

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500 

and<00:04:39.040> that's<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.370> that's<00:04:39.520> all<00:04:39.730> there<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.360> it

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
and that's it that's all there is to it

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.180 
and that's it that's all there is to it
what<00:04:41.470> you're<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.740> want<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:41.980> do<00:04:42.070> is

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
what you're going to want to do is

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.380 
what you're going to want to do is
you're<00:04:42.280> going<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.430> want<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:42.730> clear<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.120> cold

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
you're going to want to clear the cold

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.900 
you're going to want to clear the cold
on<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.750> check<00:04:43.960> engine<00:04:44.140> light<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.790> take<00:04:45.790> it

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
on the check engine light and take it

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.340 
on the check engine light and take it
for<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> test<00:04:46.330> drive<00:04:46.390> make<00:04:46.720> sure<00:04:46.870> everything

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
for a test drive make sure everything

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.380 
for a test drive make sure everything
functions<00:04:47.770> correctly<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.940> that's<00:04:49.090> all<00:04:49.240> there

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
functions correctly and that's all there

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.790 
functions correctly and that's all there
is<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:49.810> now<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.320> problem<00:04:50.530> is

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
is to it so now that the problem is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.640 
is to it so now that the problem is
fixed<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.970> then<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.750> was<00:04:52.870> pretty<00:04:53.140> clear<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.380> me

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
fixed and then it was pretty clear to me

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.800 
fixed and then it was pretty clear to me
that<00:04:53.680> anybody<00:04:54.280> need<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.610> scan<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.450> fix<00:04:55.660> the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
that anybody need to scan to to fix the

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.210 
that anybody need to scan to to fix the
problem<00:04:56.200> because<00:04:56.590> they<00:04:56.740> just<00:04:56.920> told<00:04:57.070> me<00:04:57.160> that

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
problem because they just told me that

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.980 
problem because they just told me that
all<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.520> cylinders<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:58.090> misfiring<00:04:58.540> so<00:04:58.810> it's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
all the cylinders is misfiring so it's

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.460 
all the cylinders is misfiring so it's
actually<00:04:59.200> misleading<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:01.080> if<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.260> got<00:05:02.410> a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
actually misleading and if you got a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.930

that same coil and change that that'll
fix<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:15.940> problem<00:05:16.420> good<00:05:16.990> luck
