00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
drum lesson what you just saw was a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.760 
drum lesson what you just saw was a
basic<00:01:12.030> approach<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.719> playing<00:01:12.929> a<00:01:13.109> polyrhythm

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
basic approach to playing a polyrhythm

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020 
basic approach to playing a polyrhythm
of<00:01:14.039> 4<00:01:14.789> /<00:01:15.209> 5<00:01:15.499> now<00:01:16.499> the<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:16.920> signature<00:01:17.310> groove<00:01:17.880> i

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of 4 / 5 now the time signature groove i

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.679 
of 4 / 5 now the time signature groove i
was<00:01:18.209> playing<00:01:18.539> in<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:19.409> 54<00:01:20.249> but<00:01:20.969> on<00:01:21.090> top<00:01:21.389> of<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
was playing in was 54 but on top of that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.039 
was playing in was 54 but on top of that
when<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> went<00:01:22.319> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.529> bell<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.130> applied<00:01:23.939> for

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
when I went to the bell I applied for

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
when I went to the bell I applied for
over<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.859> basically<00:01:26.130> what's<00:01:26.789> happening

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
over that so basically what's happening

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.109 
over that so basically what's happening
is<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.229> groove<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.859> thinking<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.819> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
is in the groove I'm thinking one and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:41.569 
is in the groove I'm thinking one and
two<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:30.779> three<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.350> four<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.069> five<00:01:40.520> now<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
two and three and four and five now to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.050 
two and three and four and five now to
get<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.969> four<00:01:42.299> over<00:01:42.659> top<00:01:42.929> of<00:01:42.959> it<00:01:43.759> every<00:01:44.759> fifth

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
get the four over top of it every fifth

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.319 
get the four over top of it every fifth
sixteenth<00:01:45.840> note<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> accented<00:01:47.069> which<00:01:47.999> means

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
sixteenth note is accented which means

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
sixteenth note is accented which means
if<00:01:48.599> you're<00:01:48.719> thinking<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.469> E<00:01:49.679> and<00:01:49.709> a<00:01:50.069> two<00:01:50.099> E<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
if you're thinking one E and a two E and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.629 
if you're thinking one E and a two E and
A<00:01:50.909> three<00:01:50.939> E<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.419> a<00:01:51.779> 40<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.649> 5v<00:01:53.249> end<00:01:53.399> up

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
A three E and a 40 and a 5v end up

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.969 
A three E and a 40 and a 5v end up
you're<00:01:54.299> playing<00:01:54.599> the<00:01:54.779> accents<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.709> get<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you're playing the accents to get the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.540 
you're playing the accents to get the
four<00:01:56.279> over<00:01:56.609> top<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.289> one<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.950> two

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
four over top on one and two

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.360 
four over top on one and two
and<00:02:00.640> three<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.710> four<00:02:03.160> E<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.720> oxidn<00:02:04.720> de<00:02:05.650> so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
and three and the four E and oxidn de so

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.950 
and three and the four E and oxidn de so
it's<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.910> one<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:08.110> e<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.650> to<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.790> end<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.450> 3

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
it's on the one the e of to the end of 3

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.760 
it's on the one the e of to the end of 3
and<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:12.670> 4<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.870> what<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.200> get<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.530> this

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
and the of 4 so what you get is this

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.940 
and the of 4 so what you get is this
playing<00:02:15.580> one<00:02:15.850> bar<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.360> groove<00:02:16.690> into<00:02:17.140> one

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
playing one bar of the groove into one

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.280 
playing one bar of the groove into one
bar<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.430> bell<00:02:18.730> implied<00:02:19.210> for<00:02:19.720> over<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
bar of the bell implied for over the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:03:19.580 
bar of the bell implied for over the
five<00:02:20.590> times<00:02:21.040> signature<00:02:21.670> one<00:02:22.390> two<00:02:22.990> three<00:02:23.520> four

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.080 

so<00:03:20.590> there<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:20.920> go<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.280> basic<00:03:21.730> approach

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so there you go it's a basic approach

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.630 
so there you go it's a basic approach
but<00:03:22.390> with<00:03:22.840> poly<00:03:23.140> rhythms<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.160> can<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> lot

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
but with poly rhythms you can do a lot

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.150 
but with poly rhythms you can do a lot
of<00:03:24.700> cool<00:03:25.030> things<00:03:25.170> over<00:03:26.170> top<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.920> time

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
of cool things over top of a time

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.270 
of cool things over top of a time
signature<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.600> I'm<00:03:28.780> no<00:03:28.989> tape<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.410> real<00:03:29.739> basic

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
signature so I'm no tape this real basic

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.710 
signature so I'm no tape this real basic
on<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.550> board<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.209> can<00:03:31.330> see<00:03:31.390> where

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
on the board just so you can see where

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.210 
on the board just so you can see where
you<00:03:31.810> play<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.170> notes<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.770> four<00:03:32.980> on

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
you play the notes to get the four on

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.280 
you play the notes to get the four on
top<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:34.090> let's<00:03:34.209> go<00:03:34.330> back<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.690> performance

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
top so let's go back to the performance

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.210 
top so let's go back to the performance
video<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.680> then<00:03:35.770> we'll<00:03:35.860> check<00:03:36.040> out<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
video and then we'll check out the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:04:39.140 
video and then we'll check out the
transcription<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.330> end

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.820 

alright<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:40.360> there<00:04:40.569> you<00:04:40.749> go<00:04:40.779> a<00:04:40.930> basic<00:04:41.439> approach

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
alright so there you go a basic approach

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.070 
alright so there you go a basic approach
to<00:04:42.129> playing<00:04:42.340> for<00:04:42.819> over<00:04:43.240> five<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.810> time

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
to playing for over five the time

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.189 
to playing for over five the time
signature<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:44.740> 54<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:46.150> implied<00:04:46.569> groove<00:04:46.960> on

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
signature is 54 the implied groove on

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.980 
signature is 54 the implied groove on
top<00:04:47.529> with<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.949> bell<00:04:48.189> was<00:04:48.580> four<00:04:48.969> so<00:04:49.689> once<00:04:49.870> again

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
top with the bell was four so once again

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.529 
top with the bell was four so once again
