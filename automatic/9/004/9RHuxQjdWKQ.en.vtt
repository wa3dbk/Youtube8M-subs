00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.960
 i never throw out boxes 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.960
 eggs because i always find new 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.969
 the way to apply them in the household for example 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.570
 if you have a project you can 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.029
 use for paints for glue if you 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 paint easter eggs you can them 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.730
 set so they dry in this now 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 I'll show you another way how can 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.250
 attract children to make a good gift 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.500
 for a teacher or grandmother along with 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.649
 I take the cardboard with them. I already took it off. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.210
 cover and i cut out these here 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 individual in the cup it is done 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 easy especially if you are out of paper 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.660
 egg carton and I cut it too 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 this part I had these little 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 and big here I got it 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 almost like a flower, I wear them incised 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:16.500
 four places and turn away from me 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 flower petals are produced and then you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.330
 can make them or round or 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.310
 leave square 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 and incise in many ways so that they 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.320
 were fluffy as you want 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.780
 I already have some harvested 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.049
 firstly secondly you can poke 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.600
 here a hole inside I'll show you now 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.530
 I already have some harvested 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.630
 and you just scissors if you do 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.000
 is it with the baby please this part 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.119
 do it yourself so that they don't do it to themselves 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 it hurts to see and I pierced a it will 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.420
 my piece for wand i will put them on 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 wand 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.959
 in these already have a hole and you can 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.209
 do and so or so as you like me 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.819
 elise from her walk or to eat in 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.160
 cage I took just such a branch 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:30.980
 your garden and you can fine when 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.980
 I'll put on my sprig 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.480
 some glue 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:45.360
 everything and as i said as you wish 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.610
 here this part is done very 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.470
 easy and quick really look at me 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.430
 already have two options now such I 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.670
 I'll show you how I painted a few of them. 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.940
 look how wonderful i have and 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.560
 purple and green are black and can 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.900
 make just such a vase 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.650
 firstly secondly you can apply 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.570
 what do you have in the kitchen for example i 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.790
 now paint 1 what color do you want 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.640
 i like blue 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.700
 look how you come out beautifully right away 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.070
 well you can fantasy infinitely you 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.860
 can paint 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.430
 blue on one side on the other hand and 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.180
 to make 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.300
 let's say inside make a yellow bay 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.380
 shady menus I'll take another 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.390
 brush will do a completely different color 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.390
 let's say pink inside 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.060
 It turns out great as I said 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.950
 children, you can prepare such flowers 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.069
 and they can give 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:09.159
 and grandmothers or teachers 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.790
 now i take black pepper and fall asleep it 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.319
 inside at 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.220
 you must first glue of course around 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.220
 a little bit of glue 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:27.460
 so now i'm falling asleep black pepper 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 if you paint if you paint your 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.610
 flower in red and sleep here 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.229
 so black pepper 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:41.860
 will be very much like a mac I wish you 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.060
