 in love three pieces of clothing that you 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.670
 several times in the last month in February 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 and I think right now in March also 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.200
 sometimes use one of these garments and 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.270
 I have really really super 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.280
 super in love and I wanted to make this one 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 well let's say that outfits I do not know much 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.020
 fashionable and you know it in fact I think 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.330
 I do not know anything but I'm learning 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.140
 I really like right now it is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.120
 Playing 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.250
 with clothes playing with makeup 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.350
 playing with all those things that are not 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.450
 all women make us feel good 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.210
 that raise us in self-esteem that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.979
 we really like it so, well, yes, 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.110
 He made some mistakes because you know 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.780
 excuse me and if you like my ideas 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.220
 I'm also flattered too much that as 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.840
 you always know my social networks like 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.880
 instagram and facebook I am always 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.440
 commenting and that I put that I do not know what 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.970
 that I'm trying sometimes committed 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.369
 mistakes sometimes make mistakes sometimes 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.050
 I do good things that they like a lot 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.060
 so I wanted to do the three ideas 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.380
 of outfits for moms who walk 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.789
 Up and down we want 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.630

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.460
 practice a little on the clothes 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.229
 of clothes and where I got these clothes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.500
 from clothes to shopping store known 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.929
 As I saw in style I had already heard 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.550
 on that store , and really it's 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.649
 I had listened and listened but I told myself 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.170
 count to see what wave so I went 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.750

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.950
 have these details here of how to 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.350
 diamonds thing that makes it super 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.530
 elegant super chic as well as to go out 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.360
 in the night right now that does not even 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.220
 very hot or very cold but but in 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.030
 the night still gets cool so 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.340
 I like the soft fabric very well and well 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.650
 very warm so if you put it on 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.480
 because and it's not going to come close it's not going to be 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 cold is going to give you heat because really 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.310
 it is cozy it is warm and it is 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.250
 encouragement and I like this because the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.250
 detail of the diamonds is that your 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.450
 clothes that do not need accessories at the end 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.920
 of the video what is the three 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.050
 outfits for you to tell me which one 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.710

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:22.450
 a lot is also like washing 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.260
 the wash stretches quite a lot too is very 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:30.500
 good in that aspect stretches a lot and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.440
 has a few eyes to click 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.360
 that make you look at modern feel 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.370
 I who modernize the correct word like that 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.220
 as it looks like it marks the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.980
 difference is not very father these 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.310
 details here the only thing that yes is 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.709
 as straight I do not know skinny jean so you 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.480
 go straight down 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.520
 So you have the two bags here in the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.770
 back and also here has another 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.350

 like it 's broken this do not use the 14 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.410
 February I put a photo on Instagram 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.540
 I like it a lot and I think I put it 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.550
 it's a basic gene for anxiety that 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.880
 I put a jean and a blouse whatever they are or 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.700
 the super super durable fabric nothing that 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.069
 is going to break you or nothing at all 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.870
 very good friends 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.609

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.049
 here in the bottom of video by 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.150
 if they want to go buy it in case 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.340
 interested in whether they liked and so I 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.259
 I know if they want to shop around 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.120
 the store equal or last the last thing 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:32.289
 last is this blouse friends this blouse 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.710
 is a coastline is a precious thing that is 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.690
 that when I wear it I love how 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.380
 It looks like I want to wear it more times but 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.710
 I think it 's too much it 's a pastel color 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.380
 lovely pastel green I've already been seen 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.030
 also on my social networks I love 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.490
 I do not have words to apply to you how much 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.440
 I like this blouse in the back 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.920
 has as well as how 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.560
 is cooked so that it looks like 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.080
 I do not know how you say this, but friends 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.780
 look like like lines like this super father 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.590
 which makes it obviously different from 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.350
 front to back and it is long sleeve and 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.700
 the fabric is super cool I think that 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.770
 I'm fine in spring I'll be able to 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.510
 use again more or I will not buy a 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.550
 equal to this one for another color because of 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.160

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.020
