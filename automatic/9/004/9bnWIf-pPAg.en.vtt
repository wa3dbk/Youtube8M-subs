00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:10.210
 hello youtube today I want to show 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:15.100
 one very interesting knife is interesting in 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:22.539
 first blade of the wedge this 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:24.099
 the work of the reaper of an unknown blacksmith already 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.560
 deserved a name 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:32.440
 prokopenko that is the one who anyway 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.590
 understands pay attention I'm not 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:40.450
 cheated ha that is this here is a crust 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 steel steel on this knife brand 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:51.580
 Prokopenko steel as he calls it 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 95 x 18 h 0 4 sq. They write Damascus brackets 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:59.980
 h that is such a knife here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 This knife I did to one amount 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.920
 a good friend he ordered a wedge 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.460
 literally six months later, three nights total 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:17.490
 he got his hands and that's what this 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.090
 It turned out that is Prokopenko himself 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.090
 that is, he 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.950
 position these knives with such 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.040
 blade 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.300
 like gastronomical gastronomic but 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.380
 that is, but we also had an interest in such 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.690
 no social cutting knife 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.740
 large fish there salmon and trout in 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.210
 home conditions that is some 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 let's say so strength nothing but we needed 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.410
 harder is not long but well 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.700
 But in the end the doctor ordered this for the legs 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:03.450
 I wore him literally now 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.630
 in a few minutes will come pick up 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.580
 this handsome okay i decided to share 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.350
 with the public you are beautiful things that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.310
 I can say on film 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:23.330
 that is, I with the blades clerk not 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:27.750
 worked until now no 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.870
 relationship no touch like 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.690
 the saying is made really all very 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.630
 cool is when I understand the grid 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 etching probably what that's that is 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.760
 very interesting build film 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.420
 plus from this yes such a kind. I do not know 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660
 what is it 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.519
 this call as exactly 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.010
 all-metal they are also some 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.410
 such etching is present here 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.680
 the wedge show from the blacksmith is enough 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.709
 seriously sharpened angle is very small i 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.799
 only slightly corrected by 12 thousand and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.360
 secondary on the edge see the most 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.890
 micro brings made but here it is 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.110
 geometry 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.739
 i.e. 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.299
 this post is just a big knife but 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:23.130
 pay attention to this place 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.110
 Even so, with the light playing, you can see that 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.700
 it is but 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.350
 you can specify something at first glance 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.640
 seem that kosyachok 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.650
 but let's see what's Obukhov on 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.370
 actually happening that is it 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.360
 well, a little less than half 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.060
 what shoes 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.930
 details on the order of two millimeters 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.360
 then comes thinning and just to zero 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.010
 here from this part 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:04:01.989
 here and here just zero and in the end here 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:05.980
 such a thing turns out super 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.890
 I really liked the wedge idea 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.190
 implementation I tried it enough 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.770
 neatly dressed 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.100
 friend picked up that is eventually agreed 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:25.030
 on such materials it is white 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.030
 protavochka here pebble arts and 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:35.979
 farther farther it is natural to you arena 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.080
 I got an oak we got a few pieces then 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.250
 beautiful oak 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.100
 the finest really stuff 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.320
 beautiful I did not tinted it 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:53.510
 Strong is not the same as the usual trick 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.510
 with you some iron but 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.419
 it still remains a tree 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.040
 Piglet, in principle, more or less 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.040
 well, I take a little more then 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.960
 ground arches covered up 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:16.310
 scientific circles with wax with carnauba 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.310
 that is, there is such a beauty 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.910
 such here the size of a hefty knife if 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.480
 I wonder who looks in size 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:31.320
 Now accurately ticker measure because 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.720
 I really did not even measure it 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.480
 networks, that is, the wedge have groups 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:43.200
 say 25 centimeters on the handle i 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.670
 I was made to start here start here then I 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.480
 it turns out 15 cm and in principle in principle 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:55.350
 he looks enough 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:58.590
 and harmoniously with this knife in hand very 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.520
 cool lies with that type of leg 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:08.430
 big but the knife is very very light 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:13.140
 maneuverable so I think that suddenly it will be 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:17.160
 very pleased I myself kind of touched 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:19.050
 to the creation of this blacksmith for yourself already 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.940
 decided exactly what we need not 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.600
 gastronomically so good is straight 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.860
 I will order 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:31.320
 but I'll order something for myself 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:38.400
 I liked the quality of performance in 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:40.410
 principle, the style of his poisoning is worth me 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.040
 still think that for etching here 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.040
 such a drawing 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.110
 relationship is right 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.720
 human blades then 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:55.230
 a little honest to say my opinion 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:00.590
 it's worth probably more tubes 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.590
 to say nothing particularly well here and that is, 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.630
 presentations say let's be extremely my 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:10.360
 work with sand Prokopenko 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:14.120
 i will start some little series 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.610
 tales of kitchen knives since 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.730
 there is also a near-term assembly 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:23.720
 some more cool serials 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:27.230
 damask plus also work on one 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.770
 With an interesting knife, I will definitely show you 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.510
 I will share here well on this foot but 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.260
 everything 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:38.570
 such a cool thing turned out to someone 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.510
 It will be interesting guys film 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:45.110
 Prokopenko in the work do not think that 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:47.630
 touting idle faced his 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.440
 blade pay attention to take the network 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.420
 look for 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:56.000
 because the thing is really worth 

00:07:52.420 --> 00:08:00.440
 standing both literally and figuratively a 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.130
 here it is more interesting for me to take it 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.240
 wedge 

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:07.460
 so that for hunting for recreation kebab 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.880
 finger in the kitchen sometimes indulge 

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:14.630
 cut something for the kitchen for sure 

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:18.260
 Such a thing suddenly wanted, I realized 

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:21.280
 it turned out just awesome to guys 

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.280
 thanks all good luck
