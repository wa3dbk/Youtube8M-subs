 get comfortable go 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.240
 knowledgeable people know that since 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.920
 December 2012 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.020
 this swept work on a remake 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.299
 Biden Baba for who will wear 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.950
 subtitle choice essentially we will 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.990
 wait all the same but with much bigger 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.119
 number of items and opponents myself 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.310
 this he declares that the guys will be in two 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.899
 times more than the original + remake 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.000
 local co-op will be enabled on 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.649
 two is expected that for the new bannikov 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.110
 language can be spent neither much nor 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.939
 as little as 400 hours is natural for 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.709
 order to learn everything far and wide 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.640
 the other day by the way the project appeared 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.090
 release trailer 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.899
 he is great besides the gameplay dancing there 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.849
 naked people 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.250
 Why does all the action remind you to remember 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.470
 hotline miami and manhunt does that mean 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.599
 that cruel and brutality bath kuboyda 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.819
 will be increased at times I think that yes 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.579
 also about the release date it was reported in 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.209
 trailer November 4 so far the project can 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.179
 preorder 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.799
 steam for 350 rubles expensive but of course 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.430
 but cairo and robbed entertainment as 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.079
 Baths for Bajdak rubber is normally all 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.340
 more often, the developers leave their 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.810
 large triple eight studios and 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.329
 organize small and cozy 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.670
 Desktops that make games for the soul and 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.709
 it is quite clear when you want 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.540
 do something unusual and not canonical 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.459
 in big industry, you donâ€™t 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.530
 know how your customer will react 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.660
 same time those who play independent 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.700
 project and just waiting on the industry 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.280

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.989

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 James left the studio kraytek peach 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.650

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.819
 founded his studio one person and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.709
 He called her not serpent but all for 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.269
 to start developing ultra 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.049
 world research game from the first 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.579
 no shot ok no fights only 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.650
 exploration of the surrealistic world and 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.750
 accordingly immersion in it for 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.849
 the beauty of the ultra world will even be compared with 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.980
 Cairo project where also surrealism 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.450
 elevated to the rank of beauty at this 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.859
 moment the james whip project is trying 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.019

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.290
 can video games be considered art 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.780
 some naturally speak for others not 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.670
 to judge them this film is intended in it 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.499

 p &amp; g pixel style 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.510
 this film is very close to indie

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.270
 small town 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.220
 which gradually captures 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.169
 unknown disease every day 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.240
 food getting expensive people die 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.009
 infected go everywhere alone 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.380
 whose touch makes him 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.060
 become a carrier of the virus and it happened 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.860
 that only three people can decide what 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.680

 affairs and then decide his fate 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.659
 as in the original, the main problem 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.909
 The game will be the time it is permanent 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.380
 and pretty quickly barely enough 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.960
 to run from one end 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.849
 steppe town to another and he's not 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.680
 so big just want to notice 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.139
 the way is also to talk to people 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.759
 yes all sorts of small things to do and in fact not 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.650

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.039
 run then you risk not 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.409
 completely immersed in problems never 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.300
 a quiet and peaceful town and baked 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.190
 out emphasis on what mor utopia is 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.930
 a game with decisions you have to do 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.070
 a great many and depends on them 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.260
 further plot 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.060

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.669
 medicine to give it to the rich or 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.680
 to the poor 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.849
 all this affects the inhabitants of the city and 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.099
