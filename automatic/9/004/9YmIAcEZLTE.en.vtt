00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
let's just grab our character with the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.499 
let's just grab our character with the
translate<00:01:18.560> layer<00:01:18.830> option<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:20.030> move<00:01:20.270> him

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
translate layer option and just move him

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.169 
over to the left side of the screen for
a<00:01:24.229> very<00:01:24.740> basic<00:01:24.920> example<00:01:25.190> here<00:01:26.530> now<00:01:28.179> let's

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
a very basic example here now let's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.800 
a very basic example here now let's
advance<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.690> frame<00:01:29.929> 1<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:32.420> take<00:01:32.660> our

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
advance to frame 1 and then take our

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.990 
advance to frame 1 and then take our
manipulate<00:01:33.259> bones<00:01:33.530> tool<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:36.429> let's<00:01:37.429> place<00:01:37.789> a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
manipulate bones tool and let's place a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.469 
manipulate bones tool and let's place a
starting<00:01:38.390> position<00:01:38.509> for<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.170> character

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.570 

will<00:01:44.479> kind<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.750> bring<00:01:44.989> it<00:01:45.080> over<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:45.440> this<00:01:48.580> put

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
will kind of bring it over like this put

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.350 
will kind of bring it over like this put
his<00:01:49.759> arm<00:01:50.209> like<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.840> like<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:55.300> now<00:01:56.300> we

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
his arm like that and like that now we

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.050 
his arm like that and like that now we
can<00:01:56.599> advance<00:01:56.929> a<00:01:57.319> few<00:01:57.739> frames<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.580> let's<00:01:58.819> say

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
can advance a few frames to let's say

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:12.230 
can advance a few frames to let's say
frame<00:01:59.509> 24<00:02:01.569> you<00:02:02.569> like<00:02:02.780> that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.510 

and<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:13.990> switch<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.319> hand<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.770> closed<00:02:15.100> fist

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
and I can switch I hand to a closed fist

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.360 
and I can switch I hand to a closed fist
once<00:02:15.910> I'm<00:02:16.120> done<00:02:16.360> here<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.650> again<00:02:17.950> we'll<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
once I'm done here and again we'll go to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.690 
once I'm done here and again we'll go to
just<00:02:19.120> let's<00:02:19.480> say<00:02:19.600> frame<00:02:19.870> 48<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.250> basically

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
just let's say frame 48 and basically

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.890 
just let's say frame 48 and basically
repeat<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.180> process<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:25.180> what<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:25.660> do

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
repeat this process now what you can do

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.860 
repeat this process now what you can do
I<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.770> have<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.310> tutorial<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.450> actions

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.960 
panel so what you could really do here
is<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.690> could<00:02:31.840> save<00:02:32.110> these<00:02:32.380> actions<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.850> I'm

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
is you could save these actions that I'm

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.090 
is you could save these actions that I'm
doing<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.420> create<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.930> loop<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.950> your

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
doing and create a loop for your

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.790 
doing and create a loop for your
character<00:02:36.520> walk<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.239> don't<00:02:37.420> want<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.959> keep

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
character walk if you don't want to keep

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:48.390 
character walk if you don't want to keep
doing<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.310> process<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.100> should<00:02:48.280> be

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
doing this process but this should be

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.220 
doing this process but this should be
enough<00:02:48.730> we'll<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.390> go<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> frame<00:02:49.840> 4<00:02:54.840> okay<00:02:55.840> now

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
enough we'll just go to frame 4 okay now

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.720 
enough we'll just go to frame 4 okay now
I<00:02:56.290> can<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.739> couple<00:02:57.040> more<00:02:57.130> things<00:02:57.400> I'm

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
I can do a couple more things I'm

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.970 
I can do a couple more things I'm
realizing<00:02:58.330> here<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.260> can<00:02:59.440> adjust<00:02:59.800> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
realizing here like I can adjust the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.220 
realizing here like I can adjust the
shift<00:03:00.040> slightly<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.600> can<00:03:01.780> move<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.050> head

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
shift slightly so I can move the head

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.110 
shift slightly so I can move the head
and<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:04.180> body<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.900> little<00:03:05.140> bit<00:03:05.260> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
and the body like this a little bit and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.229 
and the body like this a little bit and
then<00:03:07.120> when<00:03:07.209> we<00:03:07.300> go<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.570> frame<00:03:08.019> 24<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:09.310> can<00:03:09.940> shift

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
then when we go to frame 24 I can shift

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.300 
then when we go to frame 24 I can shift
it<00:03:10.360> up<00:03:10.570> slightly<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:14.650> kind<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.890> repeat

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
it up slightly and just kind of repeat

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:29.420 
it up slightly and just kind of repeat
that<00:03:15.519> process<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.450> remaining<00:03:16.750> frames

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.690 

and<00:03:29.870> finally<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.379> said<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> have<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.980> hand

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
and finally as I said I have that hand

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.410 
and finally as I said I have that hand
open

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
open

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.020 
open
I<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:34.170> easily<00:03:34.500> close<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.099> just<00:03:35.670> give<00:03:35.790> me<00:03:35.879> one

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
I can easily close that just give me one

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.759 
I can easily close that just give me one
second<00:03:36.390> here<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.599> just<00:03:36.900> got<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.140> switch<00:03:37.409> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
second here I just got to switch the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.009 
second here I just got to switch the
switch<00:03:38.730> layer<00:03:39.299> out<00:03:39.569> for<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:41.659> so<00:03:42.659> I'm<00:03:42.750> frame

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
switch layer out for that so I'm frame

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.539 
switch layer out for that so I'm frame
one<00:03:43.260> I'll<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.129> change<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.849> closed<00:03:45.299> fist

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
one I'll just change it to a closed fist

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.869 
one I'll just change it to a closed fist
so<00:03:47.549> now<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:48.239> have<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.980> basic<00:03:49.980> walking<00:03:50.250> animation

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
so now we have a basic walking animation

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.660 
so now we have a basic walking animation
occurring<00:03:51.329> here<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.950> next<00:03:53.250> thing<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.489> need<00:03:53.519> to

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
occurring here the next thing we need to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.809 
occurring here the next thing we need to
do<00:03:53.849> is<00:03:54.120> move<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.930> layer<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:56.159> select<00:03:56.640> your

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
do is move the layer so select your

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.550 
do is move the layer so select your
translate<00:03:57.689> layer<00:03:58.019> tool<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:59.299> make<00:04:00.299> sure<00:04:00.560> that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
translate layer tool and make sure that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.670 
translate layer tool and make sure that
you<00:04:01.859> are<00:04:02.159> on<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.700> bone<00:04:02.909> layer<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:04.500> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you are on the bone layer and not the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.369 
you are on the bone layer and not the
hand<00:04:04.889> layer<00:04:05.159> like<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.909> was<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:07.760> now<00:04:09.379> we

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
hand layer like I just was and now we

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.500 
hand layer like I just was and now we
can<00:04:11.299> go<00:04:12.299> to<00:04:12.329> frame<00:04:12.690> 1<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:14.090> just<00:04:15.090> click<00:04:15.359> to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
can go to frame 1 and just click to

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.640 
can go to frame 1 and just click to
insert<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.810> keyframe<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:17.209> go<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.269> frame<00:04:18.810> 96<00:04:19.410> or

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
insert a keyframe and go to frame 96 or

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.400 
insert a keyframe and go to frame 96 or
wherever<00:04:20.100> your<00:04:20.699> animation<00:04:21.660> currently<00:04:22.079> ends

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
wherever your animation currently ends

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.620 
wherever your animation currently ends
and<00:04:22.880> we<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.120> move<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.930> character<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:28.110> so

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and we can move the character like so

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.790 
and we can move the character like so
come<00:04:30.630> back<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.810> frame<00:04:31.199> 1<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.710> hit<00:04:32.009> play<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:34.289> we

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
come back to frame 1 and hit play and we

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.529 
come back to frame 1 and hit play and we
can<00:04:34.949> see<00:04:35.220> now<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:37.410> character<00:04:37.740> walks<00:04:38.539> now

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
can see now that the character walks now

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.150 
can see now that the character walks now
there's<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.750> few<00:04:39.840> things<00:04:40.050> we<00:04:40.169> can<00:04:40.199> adjust<00:04:40.410> he

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
there's a few things we can adjust he

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.089 
there's a few things we can adjust he
kind<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.370> walks<00:04:41.610> slow<00:04:41.970> not<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.360> mention<00:04:43.099> when

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
kind of walks slow not to mention when

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.450 
kind of walks slow not to mention when
we<00:04:44.160> look<00:04:44.340> at<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.639> his<00:04:44.970> foot<00:04:45.300> steps<00:04:45.539> are<00:04:45.720> large

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
we look at this his foot steps are large

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.409 
we look at this his foot steps are large
so<00:04:48.080> we<00:04:49.080> could<00:04:49.550> decrease<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.789> time<00:04:51.180> between

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
so we could decrease the time between

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.480 
so we could decrease the time between
each<00:04:51.780> step<00:04:52.110> by<00:04:52.680> simply<00:04:53.070> coming<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.460> our

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
each step by simply coming to our

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.850 
each step by simply coming to our
timeline<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.560> moving<00:04:55.560> our<00:04:55.710> bone<00:04:56.180> keyframes

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
timeline and moving our bone keyframes

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:10.370 
timeline and moving our bone keyframes
closer<00:04:58.860> together<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:09.270> can<00:05:09.419> also<00:05:09.599> now<00:05:10.080> move

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
closer together and I can also now move

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.000 
closer together and I can also now move
the<00:05:10.560> translate<00:05:11.159> layer<00:05:11.490> keyframe<00:05:12.449> from<00:05:13.010> frame

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
the translate layer keyframe from frame

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.500 
the translate layer keyframe from frame
96<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.909> close<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.659> frame<00:05:16.020> 53<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.460> see<00:05:18.060> how<00:05:18.210> this

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
96 to close to frame 53 and see how this

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.890 
96 to close to frame 53 and see how this
works

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
works

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.960 
works
might<00:05:21.900> be<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> little<00:05:22.169> bit<00:05:22.380> too<00:05:22.590> fast<00:05:22.860> now<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:23.940> I

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
might be a little bit too fast now so I

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.770 
might be a little bit too fast now so I
can<00:05:24.620> adjust<00:05:25.620> it<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:25.889> a<00:05:26.099> little<00:05:26.220> bit

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
can adjust it just a little bit

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.689 
can adjust it just a little bit
differently<00:05:27.830> just<00:05:28.830> spread<00:05:29.280> these<00:05:29.430> out<00:05:29.639> a

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
differently just spread these out a

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.629 
differently just spread these out a
little<00:05:29.909> bit<00:05:30.090> more<00:05:30.300> like<00:05:30.570> that<00:05:30.599> and<00:05:31.520> try<00:05:32.520> it

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
little bit more like that and try it

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.629 
little bit more like that and try it
again

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
again

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.909 
again
it's<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.729> little<00:05:35.909> bit<00:05:36.000> better<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.680> as<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:37.800> can

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
it's a little bit better and as you can

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.060 
it's a little bit better and as you can
see<00:05:37.979> he<00:05:38.490> ends<00:05:38.940> on<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.570> step<00:05:40.440> as<00:05:40.620> if<00:05:40.860> he's<00:05:40.979> going

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
see he ends on a step as if he's going

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.040 
see he ends on a step as if he's going
to<00:05:41.130> continue<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.700> walk<00:05:42.090> well<00:05:42.479> if<00:05:42.659> you<00:05:42.719> wanted

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
to continue to walk well if you wanted

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.260 
to continue to walk well if you wanted
him

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
him

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.320 
him
to<00:05:43.360> end<00:05:43.800> standing<00:05:44.800> you<00:05:45.670> could<00:05:45.820> simply<00:05:46.180> take

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
to end standing you could simply take

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.400 
to end standing you could simply take
your<00:05:46.980> manipulate<00:05:47.980> bones<00:05:48.220> tool<00:05:48.550> on<00:05:49.170> that<00:05:50.170> last

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
your manipulate bones tool on that last

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.470 
your manipulate bones tool on that last
frame<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.330> just<00:05:52.330> adjust<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.900> legs<00:05:53.140> back<00:05:53.440> to<00:05:53.830> a

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
frame and just adjust the legs back to a

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.090 
frame and just adjust the legs back to a
standing<00:05:55.480> position

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
standing position

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.040 
standing position
so<00:05:57.100> that<00:05:58.320> you<00:05:59.320> can<00:06:00.130> complete<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.420> animation

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
so that you can complete the animation

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.350 
so that you can complete the animation
if<00:06:02.200> you<00:06:02.290> wish<00:06:02.500> but<00:06:03.400> sometimes<00:06:03.790> you<00:06:03.970> might<00:06:04.090> want

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
if you wish but sometimes you might want

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.520 
if you wish but sometimes you might want
to<00:06:04.420> continue<00:06:04.870> on<00:06:05.050> with<00:06:05.080> it

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
to continue on with it

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.800 
to continue on with it
which<00:06:05.680> is<00:06:05.830> why<00:06:05.920> I<00:06:05.950> had<00:06:06.280> it<00:06:06.510> position<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:07.690> way<00:06:07.780> I

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
which is why I had it position the way I

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:19.440 
which is why I had it position the way I
did<00:06:08.080> before<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:16.180> one<00:06:16.360> more<00:06:16.510> time<00:06:16.540> now<00:06:18.210> he<00:06:19.210> walks

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
did before so one more time now he walks

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.610 
did before so one more time now he walks
and<00:06:19.810> then<00:06:20.680> he<00:06:20.830> stops<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:22.410> that's<00:06:23.410> just<00:06:23.560> a

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
and then he stops and that's just a

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.410 
and then he stops and that's just a
really<00:06:23.830> quick<00:06:23.950> example<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.700> could<00:06:24.850> go<00:06:25.090> in<00:06:25.240> and

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
really quick example I could go in and

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.970 
really quick example I could go in and
tweak<00:06:25.630> some<00:06:25.840> more<00:06:26.050> I<00:06:26.080> could<00:06:26.320> adjust<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.740> legs

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
tweak some more I could adjust the legs

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.170 
tweak some more I could adjust the legs
a<00:06:27.280> little<00:06:27.430> bit<00:06:27.610> more<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.690> speed<00:06:29.080> and<00:06:29.880> so<00:06:30.880> forth

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
a little bit more the speed and so forth

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.580 
a little bit more the speed and so forth
so<00:06:31.450> there's<00:06:31.660> a<00:06:31.720> lot<00:06:31.840> of<00:06:31.930> different<00:06:32.230> things<00:06:32.440> you

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
so there's a lot of different things you

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.840 
so there's a lot of different things you
can<00:06:32.740> do<00:06:32.890> there<00:06:33.130> there's<00:06:33.370> a<00:06:33.400> lot<00:06:33.550> of<00:06:33.640> different

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
can do there there's a lot of different

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.750 
can do there there's a lot of different
variables<00:06:34.300> obviously<00:06:35.170> but<00:06:36.160> that<00:06:36.190> is<00:06:36.550> this<00:06:36.730> a

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
variables obviously but that is this a

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.730 
variables obviously but that is this a
very<00:06:36.970> quick<00:06:37.270> example<00:06:37.390> of<00:06:37.930> how<00:06:38.080> you<00:06:38.140> can<00:06:38.380> create

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
very quick example of how you can create

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.740 
very quick example of how you can create
a<00:06:39.040> walking<00:06:39.490> animation<00:06:40.060> in<00:06:40.240> anime<00:06:41.110> studio

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
a walking animation in anime studio

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.910 
a walking animation in anime studio
anyway<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:43.960> hope<00:06:44.350> you<00:06:44.440> guys<00:06:44.560> found<00:06:44.800> this
