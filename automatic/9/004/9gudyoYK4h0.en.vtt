privacy<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.340> though<00:00:44.730> they're<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
privacy even though they're out on the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
privacy even though they're out on the
streets<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.590> live<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.010> New<00:00:47.100> York<00:00:47.160> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
streets like I don't live in New York so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
streets like I don't live in New York so
maybe<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.930> did<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> would<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.500> pretty<00:00:49.710> pissed

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
maybe if I did I would be pretty pissed

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
maybe if I did I would be pretty pissed
off<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.090> adult<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
off and also not really an adult so it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.670 
off and also not really an adult so it
could<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.829> another<00:00:53.070> factor<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.180> i<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.500> i

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
could be another factor but i think if i

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.110 
could be another factor but i think if i
lived<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.010> New<00:00:56.160> York<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.670> were<00:00:56.730> cameras

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
lived in New York and there were cameras

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
lived in New York and there were cameras
watching<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.510> while<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.949> of

watching me while I was with a lot of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770 
watching me while I was with a lot of
other<00:00:59.250> people<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.000> had<00:01:00.180> done<00:01:00.449> something

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
other people and if I had done something

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
other people and if I had done something
weird<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.350> out<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> ordinary<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.489> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
weird or out of the ordinary a lot of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.760 
think that's probably fine I don't think
there's<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.650> these

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
