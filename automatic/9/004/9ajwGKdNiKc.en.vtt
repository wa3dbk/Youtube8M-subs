 Hello everyone, I will tell you who 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.619
 wondered if someone turns off 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.869
 computer for a long time playing play let's say 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.270
 On this you climb the Internet samson persons and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.939
 the program and suddenly you turn on 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:31.460
 the computer is just like that the kitchen and it's not alone 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:35.300
 since this is the first thing that needs to be done 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.809
 clean the computer vacuuming 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.430
 vacuum gently dry wrong 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.930
 what is there to dry just he needs 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.140
 vacuum it because you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 there is dust there is a lot of dust 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 need to vacuum 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.820
 clean normally vacuum if 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
 something does not help then you need 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.449
 put a new extra cooler 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.590
 fan 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:07.830
 so he more cooled your system I 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.540
 also knew this very conveniently 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.790
 what I advise you is what 's better 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:19.229
 make give you just a thousand for 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.200
 masters of course better call the master 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.409
 if you want to plant or and for 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.119
 can pay 700 to 800 rubles here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 what else i wanted to say means if you 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.650
 want to vacuum or completely 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.110
 neatly but to avoid dust and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.990
 because you're just one of those 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.350
 fan and this very calves which 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.880
 cools your system it just doesn't 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 amount of dust understand what are you 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.079

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.600
 loads very well here but in 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 Basically, this is all the tips that I 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.990
 gave 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.990
 also you can find this this 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.540
 during 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:40.590
 just sendai see heated 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.300

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.910
 that's great helps just to clean 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.820

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.120
 which she also cleaned it according to 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.190
 not necessarily change it will not help 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.140

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.510
 the computer itself does not know just wrote 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.079
