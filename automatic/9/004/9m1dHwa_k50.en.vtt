till<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.570> let<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:37.020> dry

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.970 

now<00:01:43.270> they<00:01:43.570> try<00:01:43.870> we're<00:01:44.110> going<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.470> stick<00:01:44.710> them

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
now they try we're going to stick them

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.800 
now they try we're going to stick them
together<00:01:45.190> in<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:46.330> 90<00:01:46.720> degree<00:01:47.020> angle<00:01:48.600> line<00:01:49.600> the

together in a 90 degree angle line the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:00.480 
together in a 90 degree angle line the
little<00:01:50.310> craft<00:01:51.310> glue<00:01:58.920> sticking<00:01:59.920> these<00:02:00.220> two

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
little craft glue sticking these two

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:11.760 
little craft glue sticking these two
together<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.590> center<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:04.390> this<00:02:10.770> after

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
together from the center like this after

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.570 
together from the center like this after
it<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.040> dry

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
it is dry

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.830 
it is dry
we<00:02:12.700> will<00:02:12.820> start<00:02:13.060> our<00:02:13.270> weaving<00:02:18.630> after<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.720> is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
we will start our weaving after it is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.630 
we will start our weaving after it is
dry<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.620> will<00:02:20.710> start<00:02:21.010> weaving<00:02:23.490> taking<00:02:24.490> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
dry we will start weaving taking the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.060 
dry we will start weaving taking the
paper<00:02:24.880> strips<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:29.410> first<00:02:29.740> strip

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
paper strips like this the first strip

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.870 
paper strips like this the first strip
folding<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.700> inside<00:02:34.620> second<00:02:35.620> string<00:02:36.010> like

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
folding it inside second string like

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.490 
folding it inside second string like
this<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:39.220> third<00:02:39.490> strip<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:41.140> over<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
this the third strip going over the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.520 
this the third strip going over the
second<00:02:41.860> one<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.260> fourth

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
second one like this and the fourth

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.979 
second one like this and the fourth
strip<00:02:44.980> we<00:02:45.940> are<00:02:46.000> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.300> take<00:02:46.510> under<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
strip we are going to take under the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:55.199 
strip we are going to take under the
first<00:02:47.470> loop<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:53.880> here<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
first loop like this here we have a

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.810 
first loop like this here we have a
square<00:02:55.570> now<00:02:55.870> we<00:02:56.680> are<00:02:56.739> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.130> gently<00:02:57.400> pull

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
square now we are going to gently pull

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.250 
square now we are going to gently pull
the<00:02:58.060> opposite<00:02:58.660> strips<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:01.270> tighten<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.900> like

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.650 

this<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:07.030> we<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> foundation<00:03:07.989> square

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
this now we have a foundation square

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.479 
this now we have a foundation square
don't<00:03:10.660> pull<00:03:10.930> them<00:03:11.140> too<00:03:11.320> tightly<00:03:11.620> or<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.310> paper

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
don't pull them too tightly or the paper

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:21.380 
don't pull them too tightly or the paper
will<00:03:12.790> tear<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:17.020> this<00:03:19.260> now<00:03:20.260> we'll<00:03:20.470> keep

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
will tear like this now we'll keep

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.560 
will tear like this now we'll keep
beading<00:03:22.950> by<00:03:23.950> making<00:03:24.430> loops<00:03:25.530> like<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:27.570> and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
beading by making loops like this and

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.470 
beading by making loops like this and
then<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.110> will<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.320> taking<00:03:29.680> our<00:03:29.830> strips<00:03:30.480> under

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
then we will be taking our strips under

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.130 
then we will be taking our strips under
the<00:03:31.860> opposite<00:03:32.860> loops<00:03:33.480> taking<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.600> over<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the opposite loops taking it over the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.490 
the opposite loops taking it over the
first<00:03:35.410> loop<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.920> under<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.670> second

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.010 

doing<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> same<00:03:42.890> with<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.280> one<00:03:43.930> taking<00:03:44.930> it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
doing the same with this one taking it

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.890 
doing the same with this one taking it
over<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.560> first<00:03:45.800> loop<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.280> under<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.240> second

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.350 

pulling<00:03:53.900> them<00:03:54.140> through<00:03:56.230> gently<00:03:58.360> tightening

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
pulling them through gently tightening

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.850 
pulling them through gently tightening
it<00:03:59.540> to<00:04:00.230> make<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> square<00:04:02.650> continue<00:04:03.650> weaving

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
it to make a square continue weaving

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.680 
it to make a square continue weaving
till<00:04:04.430> we<00:04:04.610> reach<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.820> end<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.630> our<00:04:05.840> strips<00:04:07.690> now

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
till we reach the end of our strips now

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.360 
till we reach the end of our strips now
we<00:04:08.750> are<00:04:08.900> almost<00:04:09.020> done<00:04:09.320> weaving<00:04:09.920> our<00:04:10.270> strips<00:04:12.370> we

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
we are almost done weaving our strips we

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:34.330 
we are almost done weaving our strips we
continue<00:04:13.940> doing<00:04:14.330> them<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.910> end<00:04:30.880> as<00:04:33.340> we

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
continue doing them to the end as we

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.060 
continue doing them to the end as we
reach<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.550> end<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:35.360> our<00:04:36.230> strips<00:04:36.620> we<00:04:36.800> are<00:04:36.860> going

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
reach the end of our strips we are going

00:04:37.070 --> 00:05:00.530 
reach the end of our strips we are going
to<00:04:37.190> glue<00:04:37.430> them<00:04:37.700> together

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.330 

if<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.720> loops<00:05:01.930> becomes<00:05:02.380> smaller<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.010> becomes

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
if the loops becomes smaller it becomes

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:20.700 
if the loops becomes smaller it becomes
a<00:05:03.460> little<00:05:03.610> difficult<00:05:03.760> taking<00:05:04.450> them<00:05:05.250> under

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:29.140 

this<00:05:23.920> will<00:05:24.920> just<00:05:25.190> fly<00:05:26.000> away<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.300> view<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:29.030> the
