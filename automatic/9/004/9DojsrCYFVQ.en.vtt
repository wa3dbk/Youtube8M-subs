includes<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> character<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> other

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
includes a character just like the other

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
includes a character just like the other
sets<00:00:41.730> too<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.809> called<00:00:43.020> patch

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sets too and this one is called patch

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
sets too and this one is called patch
and<00:00:43.890> patch<00:00:44.670> sits<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> control<00:00:45.960> tower

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and patch sits up in the control tower

and patch sits up in the control tower
and<00:00:46.530> she<00:00:46.829> tells<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.059> piston<00:00:48.570> peak<00:00:48.780> air<00:00:48.809> attack

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and she tells the piston peak air attack

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.400 
and she tells the piston peak air attack
crew<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> fires<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:52.289> they

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
crew where the fires are and when they

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.680 
crew where the fires are and when they
need<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> dispatch<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.699> set<00:00:53.940> does<00:00:54.239> require

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
need a dispatch so this set does require

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
need a dispatch so this set does require
some<00:00:54.980> assembly<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.670> aren't<00:00:56.789> too<00:00:57.000> many

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
some assembly but there aren't too many

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
some assembly but there aren't too many
pieces<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:58.020> it'll<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.260> pretty

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
pieces so I think it'll go pretty

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
pieces so I think it'll go pretty
quickly<00:01:09.920> okay<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> quick<00:01:11.640> assembly

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
quickly okay that was a quick assembly

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
quickly okay that was a quick assembly
let's<00:01:12.720> take<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> look<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.409> thing<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:13.830> that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
let's take a look at this thing now that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249 
let's take a look at this thing now that
it's<00:01:14.220> all<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:14.790> together<00:01:14.939> starting<00:01:15.900> over<00:01:15.990> here

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it's all put together starting over here

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's all put together starting over here
with<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.650> barrel<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.810> I'm<00:01:18.810> guessing<00:01:19.110> that's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
with this barrel and I'm guessing that's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
with this barrel and I'm guessing that's
like<00:01:19.320> an<00:01:19.439> oil<00:01:19.710> barrel<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> keep<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
like an oil barrel you know to keep the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.550 
like an oil barrel you know to keep the
oil<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.630> barrels<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.650> has<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.820> fire<00:01:24.560> push

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
oil in barrels and it has some fire push

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
oil in barrels and it has some fire push
that<00:01:25.770> fire<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:27.270> part<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that fire up and that's part of the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
that fire up and that's part of the
story<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.439> story<00:01:28.770> set<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:29.909> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
story this is a story set and it kind of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
story this is a story set and it kind of
goes<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> gets<00:01:31.079> any<00:01:31.229> weight<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
goes down when it gets any weight on it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
goes down when it gets any weight on it
so<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.000> where<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.390> come<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.869> we've<00:01:34.350> got

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so that's where these come in we've got

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
so that's where these come in we've got
two<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.369> come<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> set<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
two of these that come with a set the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.350 
two of these that come with a set the
other<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.200> they're<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> attach<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
other one and they're going to attach to

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
other one and they're going to attach to
dusty<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.840> actually<00:01:40.170> any<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> plane's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
dusty or actually any of the plane's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.090 
dusty or actually any of the plane's
toys<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> proper<00:01:42.360> attachment

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
toys that have the proper attachment

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.889 
toys that have the proper attachment
points<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.250> let's<00:01:44.670> grab<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> dusty<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
points so let's grab a dusty here and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
points so let's grab a dusty here and
you<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.530> water<00:01:46.740> bomb<00:01:47.329> put<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.420> in

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you take the little water bomb put it in

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.800 
you take the little water bomb put it in
there<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.439> dusty<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.790> flying<00:01:51.119> around<00:01:51.540> with

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there now dusty go flying around with

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.380 
there now dusty go flying around with
that<00:01:51.899> water<00:01:52.200> bomb<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.890> guess<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.240> can

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that water bomb and guess what you can

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.929 
that water bomb and guess what you can
drop<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.490> when<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.759> comes

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
drop it right there and when it comes

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
drop it right there and when it comes
down<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> hits

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
down and hits

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.760 
down and hits
puts<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.400> fire<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.870> hangar<00:02:01.290> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
puts the fire out this is the hangar so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.710 
puts the fire out this is the hangar so
this<00:02:01.950> would<00:02:02.160> be<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.460> where<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.730> do<00:02:02.790> work<00:02:03.510> on

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
this would be like where they do work on
