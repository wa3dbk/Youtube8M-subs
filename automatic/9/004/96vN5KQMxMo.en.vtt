00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
natural peanut butter that's the reason

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.870 
natural peanut butter that's the reason
that<00:03:13.069> regular<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.190> Nirvana<00:03:14.430> doesn't<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.790> that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
that regular to Nirvana doesn't do that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.759 
that regular to Nirvana doesn't do that
because<00:03:15.079> manufacturers<00:03:16.079> don't<00:03:16.440> want<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
because manufacturers don't want that to

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.920 
because manufacturers don't want that to
happen<00:03:16.829> think<00:03:17.639> about<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.690> people

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
happen think about this so that people

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.500 
happen think about this so that people
don't<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.169> to<00:03:19.260> use<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.829> spoon<00:03:20.280> when<00:03:21.120> they<00:03:21.209> open

their peanut butter manufacturers are
giving<00:03:24.090> them<00:03:24.209> trans<00:03:24.569> fats<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.109> we're<00:03:25.410> okay

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
giving them trans fats and we're okay

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.559 
giving them trans fats and we're okay
with<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.919> we're<00:03:26.609> ruining<00:03:26.790> our<00:03:27.000> helps<00:03:27.299> not<00:03:27.540> to
