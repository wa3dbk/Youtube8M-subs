my old grip it was a little bit too thin

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.399 
my old grip it was a little bit too thin
and<00:01:03.309> like<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.789> low<00:01:03.940> parts<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:05.080> what<00:01:05.290> we

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
and like the low parts and so what we

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.260 
and like the low parts and so what we
did<00:01:05.560> was<00:01:05.770> we<00:01:05.979> made<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.729> little<00:01:06.759> bit<00:01:07.060> thicker

did was we made it a little bit thicker
and<00:01:07.689> changed<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.320> design<00:01:08.680> of<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> grip

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
and changed the design of the grip

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.779 
and changed the design of the grip
pattern

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
pattern

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.249 
pattern
it<00:01:09.880> really<00:01:10.180> feels<00:01:10.390> better<00:01:10.689> on<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.049> hand

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
it really feels better on the hand

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.469 
it really feels better on the hand
because<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:11.950> not<00:01:12.100> such<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.399> drastic<00:01:12.759> like

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
because it's not such a drastic like

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.300 
because it's not such a drastic like
change<00:01:13.840> in<00:01:14.020> heights<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.740> not<00:01:14.860> only<00:01:15.009> lasts

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
change in heights it it not only lasts

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.920 
change in heights it it not only lasts
longer<00:01:15.670> but<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:15.909> also<00:01:16.060> feels<00:01:16.360> better<00:01:16.630> on<00:01:16.720> your

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
longer but it also feels better on your

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.990 
longer but it also feels better on your
hand<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.409> that's<00:01:17.530> really<00:01:18.250> what<00:01:18.490> matters<00:01:18.670> the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
hand and that's really what matters the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:02:31.190 
hand and that's really what matters the
most<00:01:19.030> about<00:01:19.450> grips

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
