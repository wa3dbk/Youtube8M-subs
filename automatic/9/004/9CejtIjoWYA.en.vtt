foot and for Dragon Ball Z figures as

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.089 
foot and for Dragon Ball Z figures as
far<00:02:51.469> as<00:02:51.560> they<00:02:51.650> go

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
far as they go

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.839 
far as they go
these<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.180> think<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> most<00:02:54.849> articulated

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
these I think are the most articulated

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.080 
these I think are the most articulated
ones<00:02:56.060> out<00:02:56.269> there<00:02:56.449> I<00:02:56.689> have<00:02:57.620> quite<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.669> few<00:02:58.879> from

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
ones out there I have quite a few from

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.849 
ones out there I have quite a few from
different<00:02:59.449> series<00:02:59.870> made<00:03:00.139> by<00:03:00.169> Bandai<00:03:00.829> and

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
different series made by Bandai and

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.689 
different series made by Bandai and
everybody<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> they<00:03:03.250> really<00:03:04.250> lack<00:03:04.489> an

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:04.699 
everybody and they really lack an

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.369 
everybody and they really lack an
articulation<00:03:05.239> which<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.689> surprising<00:03:06.230> because

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
articulation which is surprising because

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.459 
articulation which is surprising because
and<00:03:07.299> Dragon<00:03:08.299> Ball<00:03:08.449> Z<00:03:08.659> all<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.109> amazing

fighting moves you figure you know you

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.869 
fighting moves you figure you know you
need<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.349> articulation<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.250> reenact<00:03:13.639> those

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
need the articulation to reenact those

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.030
