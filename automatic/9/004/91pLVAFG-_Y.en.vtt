it takes a lot to get used to it okay
you<00:01:13.890> take<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.480> put<00:01:15.480> it<00:01:15.600> inside<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
you take it like that put it inside the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.469 
you take it like that put it inside the
hole

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.029 

and<00:01:22.570> then<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:24.549> it's<00:01:24.939> folded<00:01:25.240> up<00:01:25.509> like<00:01:25.600> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and then you just take the inside folds

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.789 
and then you just take the inside folds
and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.849 

that's<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.729> working<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.500> then<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.649> just

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
that's not working and then you just

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.179 
that's not working and then you just
kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> push<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:42.409> if<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.619> doesn't<00:01:43.649> you

kind of push them out if it doesn't you
know<00:01:44.280> automatically<00:01:44.789> open<00:01:46.009> but<00:01:47.009> um<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> by

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
know automatically open but um and by

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.999 
know automatically open but um and by
the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.090> stretch<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.110> because

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the way do not stretch like this because

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.249 
the way do not stretch like this because

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.260 

when<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> take<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.929> out<00:02:01.049> it'll<00:02:02.039> your<00:02:02.939> skin

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
when you take it out it'll your skin

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.609 
when you take it out it'll your skin
will<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.569> kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.869> grown<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> little

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
will be kind of grown into it a little

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
will be kind of grown into it a little
bit<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.270> it'll<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.799> rip<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> tear<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
bit and it'll you know rip and tear and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.729 
bit and it'll you know rip and tear and
stuff<00:02:09.899> no<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:12.920> well<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.280> sucks

yeah that's all you didn't fold it up
twice<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:27.959> put<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.650> let<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.800> go

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
you like this you probably wouldn't know

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.289 
you like this you probably wouldn't know
that<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.870> was<00:03:07.019> wearing<00:03:07.200> anything<00:03:08.180> unless<00:03:09.180> you

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
that I was wearing anything unless you

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.970 
that I was wearing anything unless you
knew<00:03:09.870> about<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:12.170> skins<00:03:13.170> there<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.160> um<00:03:14.340> yeah

knew about the skins there but um yeah

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.440 
knew about the skins there but um yeah
pretty<00:03:16.980> cool<00:03:17.250> pieces<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.819> jewelry<00:03:18.180> how<00:03:18.269> would

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
pretty cool pieces of jewelry how would

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.160 
pretty cool pieces of jewelry how would
it<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.780> would<00:03:19.230> suggest<00:03:20.040> getting<00:03:20.579> them<00:03:22.790> if<00:03:23.790> you

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.129 

on<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> butt<00:03:29.269> thing<00:03:30.269> like<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.660> was<00:03:30.810> saying<00:03:31.019> don't

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
on a butt thing like I was saying don't

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.170 
on a butt thing like I was saying don't
stretch<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:31.650> them<00:03:31.739> same<00:03:32.459> thing<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.940> got<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
stretch for them same thing you got to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.539 
stretch for them same thing you got to
let<00:03:33.299> your<00:03:33.720> whole<00:03:33.989> heel<00:03:34.410> before<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:35.459> them

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
let your whole heel before you put them

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.240 
let your whole heel before you put them
in<00:03:35.670> because<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.120> same<00:03:36.299> thing<00:03:36.480> will<00:03:36.600> happen

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.690 

because<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:41.760> porous<00:03:42.269> silicones<00:03:42.900> porous<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
because it's porous silicones porous and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.220 
because it's porous silicones porous and
your<00:03:44.700> skin<00:03:45.269> will<00:03:45.540> heal<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.319> pores<00:03:46.560> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
your skin will heal into the pores and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.750 
your skin will heal into the pores and
so<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.290> can't<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.829> out<00:03:49.950> very<00:03:50.250> easy<00:03:50.430> and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
so you can't get it out very easy and

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.180 
so you can't get it out very easy and
you'll<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.269> rip<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.750> it'll<00:03:52.739> mess<00:03:53.010> up

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
you'll have to rip it and it'll mess up

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.289 
you'll have to rip it and it'll mess up
your<00:03:53.340> ear<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.670> stuff<00:03:55.280> just<00:03:56.280> not<00:03:56.760> good

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
your ear and stuff just not good

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.870 
your ear and stuff just not good
plus<00:03:58.019> it's<00:03:58.230> hard<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.680> stretch<00:03:59.340> with<00:03:59.459> silicone

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
plus it's hard to stretch with silicone

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.490 
plus it's hard to stretch with silicone
anyway<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> tried<00:04:00.540> before<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.049> knew<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.380> it

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
anyway I tried before I knew that it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.430 
anyway I tried before I knew that it
would<00:04:01.560> miss<00:04:01.769> your<00:04:02.280> stuff<00:04:02.819> up<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:04.170> could

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
would miss your stuff up and I could

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.020 
would miss your stuff up and I could
never<00:04:04.590> get<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.310> all<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.489> way<00:04:05.519> through<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.000> I

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
never get it all the way through so I

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.300
