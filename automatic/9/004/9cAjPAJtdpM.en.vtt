00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.220
 the earth a rocky planet of the system 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.070
 solar the solar system includes a 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.999
 star the sun and many objects 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.740
 with different characteristics 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.020
 the earth is one of the eight planets in 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.120
 orbits around the sun with its 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.160
 Mercury next to Venus and March 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.800
 it belongs to the group of planets 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.610
 rocky six planets is characterized 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.920
 by a significant density a 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.010
 rocky solid surface and a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.340
 chemistry and means that the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.310
 four giant gas planets jupiter 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.890
 saturne uranus and neptune are a lot 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.180
 further away from the sun 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.870
 our object as satellites 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.180
 natural comets and asteroids 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.300
 is distinguished from the earth by most 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.399
 of their characteristics 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.780
 in the current state of knowledge 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.620
 scientists 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.559
 the earth is the only planet that houses 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.219
 this would stem from another specificity 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.299
 of earth the presence in a sub 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.060
 liquid form 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.609
 the last is indispensable to life 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.399
 the water molecule however exists 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:19.459
 elsewhere in the solar system under 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.389
 form of ice for example on march under 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.499
 gaseous form 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:26.630
 for example in the atmosphere of Venus 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:29.060
 of the ohl type could could also be 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.789
 find on the surface of some bodies 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.340
 for example 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.100
 no this saturn satellite 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.259
 the earth has enough mass to 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.109
 retain the elements the young people who 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.270
 make up an atmosphere our planet 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.719
 and therefore surrounded by a fairly 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.999
 thick 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:51.439
 its composition is compatible with life 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.950
 did not involve the presence of water 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.560
 liquid 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.299
 the presence of liquid water ensures the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.599
 surface of a planet depends on 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.270
 pressure and temperature conditions 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:04.729
 who reigns the temperature is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.399
 directly related to the planet distance 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.619
 sun it also depends on the presence 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.750
 of an atmosphere that can trap a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.830
 part of solar radiation and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.320
 increase the temperature 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.950
 greenhouse effect around each star 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.920
 have defined an area where a planet 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.530
 possessing an atmosphere and is at a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.290
 distance we are the canvases such as 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.810
 the presence of liquid water on the surface is 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.620
 possible it is the usual zone 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.260
 of habitability of the planets located out 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.530
 of our solar system and in the area 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.030
 habitability of the star were 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.120
 discovered these planets the exoplanets 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.520
 so may be livable 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 likely to shelter there but 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.050
 nothing says that they are actually 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.100
 to live outside the area 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.550
 roominess 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.590
 life is not impossible but it does not 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.450
 could not colonized the surface of the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.450
 planet as is the case on earth
