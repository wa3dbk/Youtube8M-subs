00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello welcome to one more edition of 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.910
 the floridos I suppose that many 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.599
 They know how to achieve a good reputation 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.840
 on facebook but they are realizing 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.130
 of the things that they do that could 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.620
 cause them a bad reputation 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.690
 Here are five little things that you maybe 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.260
 they are doing and they are not giving 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 account 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.590
 the first 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.099
 is having its reputation on facebook 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.720
 it is do not know yourselves or not be faithful 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 to the way they want their 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.880
 brand service or company company you see 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.190
 represented on social networks is 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.600
 very easy for humans yet to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.129
 Although we are heading to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.470
 through a cell phone or through a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.480
 computer know what messages are 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.449
 certain and what messages are not true 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.330
 that can not even decipher the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.690
 more complex algorithms that is 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.739
 a human issue and everything is easily the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.510
 human beings 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.120
 we do not read anything but a statement if not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.759
 we read a whole context if suddenly 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.430
 someone issues or publishes something on facebook 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.740
 that is not being faithful to what has been 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 come publishing then this is going to be 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 noise in the minds of those who are in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.440
 contact with the information and they will be given 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 mind that there is something that does not fit there 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.550
 something that is not right then always 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.310
 you have to be constant and faithful to one 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.720
 same on facebook because people are given 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.070
 Count numbers deliberately lying 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.200
 this is very much in contact with the first 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 point that is not being yourself 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.140
 but it goes a little bit more focused on saying 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 lies or not having a record of all 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 the truths that we say that can 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 also being considered a lie is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 say if for example an example 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.659
 we promote some promotion go to the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 rebuznance on the internet and suddenly you 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.460
 we tell a customer one thing and another 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 client something else and suddenly for those 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.750
 hazards of fate it turns out that these two 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 people are already known because of the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.520
 lie of who posted the information 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.459
 and the lie will crawl up the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.649
 company or asia of finance or who has 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.840
 issued it is important that all 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.530
 messages be constant be truthful 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.349
 and be testable that's why I'm very 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.480
 clueless and not out of eagerness with the desire to 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.450
 lie but because I'm clueless 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.010
 I always try to have a record 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.019
 written of all the conversations that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 I have with clients on facebook 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.130
 that way I know there is a constancy 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.349
 I know there is agreement between the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.870
 messages that myth and I can forward 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.970
 some message in the past to review 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.690
 exactly what I said and how 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.070
 I said 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.170
 It is one thing to which we are very 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.540
 tempted to carry out especially if 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.190
 we use facebook not just as a 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.120
 business network but also as a 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.730
 social network 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 this is complaining about a client 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.430
 past or complain about our partner in 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.609
 our husband and so on 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.780
 It is very normal that we want to share 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.370
 any and all areas of 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.890
 our facebook life if we go up 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.079
 together until we eat it because not 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.090
 we had to comment talk or 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.099
 share the information if we want 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.819
 complain to someone even though that someone 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.060
 be a customer or that someone be our 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.239
 it's not strange at all, but if 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.980
 what happens to this when we complain 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.189
 it happens a lot that all the negative things 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.370
 that are said that we say in 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.620
 internet are I do not know why maybe it was 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.139
 the way of people who are like 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.120
 absorbed much faster and are 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.120
 reme remembered and will say of 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.639
 membranes are remembered much more 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.739
 easy that to the positive things because 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.090
 I do not know, I think it's the desire to be 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.069
 human always be looking for the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.400
 needle in the haystack with something like that 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.230
 so if you have a bad 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.579
 experience with a client for example 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.859
 in my case that I had a bad 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.930
 experience with some clients that I 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.879
 They hired for their wedding and I 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.129
 posted on facebook something bad about them 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.290
 I say pss how they did not pay me I did not 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.819
 they met or as they did me wrong 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.099
 etc 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.450
 I may be relieving myself 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.790
 that I 'm using facebook as my 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.519
 exhaust valve but this in the end is 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.739
 read for future future times 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.919
 potentials to see that one has that 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.750
 freedom to complain so widely of 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.940
 a client then he will say so 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.590
 imagine what I'm like next 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.479
 client of which with which she has 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.250
 a problem and published on its website 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.009
 facebook nobody wants to stay in 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.690
 evidence and much less future 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.180
 customers are going to want you to leave them without 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.030
 evidence if you have a problem 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.360
 with a client the best thing is that you treat it 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.819
 inbox 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.919
 phone but in a personal way ping 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.840
 pong with that customer not with all the 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.789
 world and why you should not leave them 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.250
 our partners because simply to 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.810
 nobody cares about the problems that you 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.939
 you can have on facebook and very much 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.860
 least they care if you have a period 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.229
 a problem with your husband and what are you 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.310
 posting on facebook so that what 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.169
 we do is just how to continue with chile the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.849
 morbo that may have other people and 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.620
 At the end they will always remember that 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.379
 you were the one who had a problem with the 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.150
 husband and you post it on facebook something 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.099
 which is extremely harmful that we do 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.860
 on facebook and that according to our 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:21.400
 number four is to be constant and 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.500
 exaggeratedly negative especially if in 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.050
 instead of putting hello this I hope they have 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.289
 a nice week Felix Luna exposes 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.259
 it's not again how I hate these 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.270
 days see hell I do not know what's coming 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.159
 following with that hatred on Tuesdays is 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.690
 this guard of the world that is the people I 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.590
 started to say good and this person 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.090
 will be happy or what will be 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.740
 I'm after we have to be 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.960
 faithful to the way you are 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.350
 on facebook completely agree 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.820
 but if that way is to be all day 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.340
 be negative and if we do not have 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.500
 absolutely nothing good to say about 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.120
 no situation so let's do how 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.760
 judge and he who has nothing good that 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.790
 say that better not say anything and the number 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.470
 5 and the most important of all these 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.380
 points and one that does not even have 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.740
 room for discussion 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.620
 bad if you are using facebook and 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.530
 you have a lot of spelling mistakes 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.800
 it's really horrible it's horrible to see 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.550
 messages posts on facebook that 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.830
 have bad spelling and I do not mean 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.630
 shift accents because that's a mistake 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.970
 It can happen to many if not 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.910
 use letters to use them where you're going 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.040
 the zeta octava the so do not write it 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.740
 sapiens or change things times the 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.050
 truth really really grab a 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.390
 dictionary, read books and 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.070
 magazines leave facebook as I would say 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.340
 Gandhi bookstore here I hope I get paid 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.440
 more book and -6 royalties because that's what 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.840
 what we need and that's the only thing 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.820
 denotes the misspelled messages in the 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.980
 social networks that you feel you do not have 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.650
 education is people who are not interested 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.400
 educate yourself and it's people who do not consider a 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.180
 courtesy to write 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.490
 for others then really less 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.229
 who are 15 years old are in the circular 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.600
 already and nobody else than his friends the 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.880
 of the cecu see what they publish 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.280
 please do not dare to write things 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.919
 with bad spelling there are so many resources 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.630
 of which the internet even in that 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.030
 at the same time we can know if a 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.180
 word is well or poorly written before 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.699
 post it on facebook please 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.470
 let's make a small gift to the royal 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:32.780
 academy of the Spanish language and 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.479
 we use the language how this is due 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.130
 it was all guys I'm sorry if there's any 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.110
 point that fell like a stone 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.120
 I hope he has not insulted them and only 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.250
 will serve to improve the way 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.930
 we use social networks and so that 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.600
 keep pressing having a good network 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:52.120
 on facebook I leave them and send them a 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.120
 greeting from my growing with us
