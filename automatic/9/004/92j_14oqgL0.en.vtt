00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:10.190
 well here we have it neither renal 4 super 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:13.160
 from 71 that this car had seen it 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.530
 seven years ago yes 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.029
 I tried to buy it then but not 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.770
 it was for sale and then I bought it another 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.970
 Sir 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:30.610
 that was driving him very much what 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 good is that he changed the engine to 1100 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 he still carries the gear change from him 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.270
 of the 850 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.570
 I have done a lot of work in painting 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.490
 sheet because they were using it daily 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.120
 as 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:54.630
 like working as a bricklayer putting 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.670
 blocks and everything paint the wheels 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.670
 I put this understood from here 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.840
 that does not look good in the sun yet 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:13.460
 you have all your chrome wheels 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 color cream terrible much the rust 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.270
 It has been a lot of work but it has been worth 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.480
 I'm sorry the cow got it from a renault 4 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.409
 of the year 63 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.230
 inside 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.280
 A) Yes 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:38.620
 precious but that can be seen well from 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.740
 a renault 4 again from 65 the steering wheel 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:48.590
 it's also a round 4 of the 64 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.360
 has its outside fan 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.260
 and a ball 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.260
 Out of 8 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.110
 works perfectly fine 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.850
 how does the 1100 engine and the change of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.340
 March of an 850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.410
 it's quite revolutionized but that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.730
 means that climbs the slopes 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.830
 without any problem 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 and still goes with a dynamo but all 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.120
 works like a charm 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.390
 I use it three days a week 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.390
 weekends when it's not raining 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 and I'm delighted because it 's the model 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.110
 old man I've always loved my mother 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.420
 had the same with 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.420
 the front of aluminum 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.920
 paint on the hood is original and on the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.550
 the ceiling 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.840
 and the wheels that have been very nice 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:04.740

 one of 87 and I still have it 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.100

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.530
 I am very very very happy 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 as you can see 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.250
 but I have pretty nice would have to 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.360
 paint it again but for now 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.630
 is 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.090

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.300
