this<00:01:48.149> keeps<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.689> tree<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.140> getting<00:01:49.409> sunburned

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
this keeps a tree from getting sunburned

this keeps a tree from getting sunburned
and<00:01:51.649> they<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:53.490> will<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:54.360> sunburned

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and they do they will get sunburned

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 
and they do they will get sunburned

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
caused a lot of damage to the trees we

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
caused a lot of damage to the trees we
used<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> paint<00:02:02.040> them<00:02:02.250> before<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.670> shipped

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
used to paint them before we shipped

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.359 
used to paint them before we shipped
them<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.930> people<00:02:04.170> freaked<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.860> too<00:02:05.159> much

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
