first signing of the day and that
signing<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.490> Nasri<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.450> sentiment

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
signing is Nasri as the sentiment

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.780 
signing is Nasri as the sentiment

obviously he starts as a cam so it's

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.670 
obviously he starts as a cam so it's
going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.120> bit<00:00:15.299> more<00:00:15.330> expensive<00:00:15.750> than
