videos<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:18.479> ever<00:01:18.750> were<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> mine

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
videos as there ever were you know mine

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160 
videos as there ever were you know mine
warfare<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.310> videos<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.000> yeah<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
warfare two videos and yeah there was a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
warfare two videos and yeah there was a
random-ass<00:01:22.740> triple<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:24.000> no

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
random-ass triple right here I have no

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
random-ass triple right here I have no
clue<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.689> spawned<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.290> or

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
clue I think they just spawned there or

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.789 
clue I think they just spawned there or
they<00:01:26.100> had<00:01:26.280> cold<00:01:26.490> blooded<00:01:26.670> pro<00:01:27.140> but<00:01:28.140> either<00:01:28.530> way

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
they had cold blooded pro but either way

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
they had cold blooded pro but either way
I<00:01:29.009> think<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I think that's the that's one of the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
I think that's the that's one of the
reasons<00:01:31.470> why<00:01:31.829> call<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> duty<00:01:32.729> black<00:01:32.880> ops<00:01:33.180> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
reasons why call of duty black ops is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
reasons why call of duty black ops is
getting<00:01:33.659> hate<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.680> aside<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:35.040> weapons

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
getting hate you know aside from weapons

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.999 
getting hate you know aside from weapons
like<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.180> famas<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> 70<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
like the famas and the 70 for you and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.530 
like the famas and the 70 for you and
this<00:01:38.850> random<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.390> lag<00:01:39.600> spike<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:41.329> believe<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this random as lag spike I believe that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
this random as lag spike I believe that
that's<00:01:43.009> pretty<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:45.049> won<00:01:46.049> at<00:01:46.350> least<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that's pretty much won at least one of

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.609 
that's pretty much won at least one of
the<00:01:47.130> reasons<00:01:47.460> why<00:01:47.640> why<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.780> isn't<00:01:49.259> sitting

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the reasons why why it isn't sitting

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
the reasons why why it isn't sitting
well<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.979> certain<00:01:50.549> people<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.090> mean<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.600> like

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
well with certain people I mean I like

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.770 
well with certain people I mean I like
the<00:01:52.049> game<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> pioneer<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the game and I'm a pioneer right now and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.859 
the game and I'm a pioneer right now and
I<00:01:55.140> guess<00:01:55.740> reducing<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.210> amount<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> publicity

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I guess reducing the amount of publicity

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.810 
I guess reducing the amount of publicity
that<00:01:58.259> black<00:01:58.500> ops<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.799> getting<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> people

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that black ops is getting so that people

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.850 
that black ops is getting so that people
will<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.360> enjoy<00:02:01.020> later<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.770> the

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.320 
blah blah blah doesn't that and I think
I<00:04:54.950> think<00:04:55.580> it's<00:04:55.730> because<00:04:55.880> of<00:04:56.060> the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
I think it's because of the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.420 
I think it's because of the
oversaturation<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:58.040> it<00:04:58.070> is<00:04:58.280> on

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
YouTube I mean mon amour 42 was at a

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.710 
YouTube I mean mon amour 42 was at a
point<00:05:00.800> on<00:05:01.220> same<00:05:01.790> thing<00:05:02.000> pretty<00:05:02.240> much<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.570> same

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
point on same thing pretty much the same

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.430 
point on same thing pretty much the same
thing<00:05:02.960> however<00:05:04.450> people<00:05:05.450> quickly<00:05:05.780> realize

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
thing however people quickly realize

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.540 
thing however people quickly realize
that<00:05:06.680> mon<00:05:06.830> amour<00:05:06.980> 42<00:05:07.400> is<00:05:07.840> kind<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.990> game<00:05:09.140> that

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
that mon amour 42 is kind of a game that

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.220 
that mon amour 42 is kind of a game that
you<00:05:10.550> know<00:05:10.700> they<00:05:11.390> don't<00:05:11.450> only<00:05:11.630> have<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.870> put<00:05:12.050> and

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
you know they don't only have to put and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.690 
you know they don't only have to put and
I<00:05:12.260> think<00:05:12.500> also<00:05:12.800> one<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.310> reasons<00:05:13.610> is

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
I think also one of the reasons is

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.920 
I think also one of the reasons is
theater<00:05:13.910> mode<00:05:14.120> so<00:05:14.300> many<00:05:14.450> people<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:14.780> now

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
theater mode so many people can now

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.860 
theater mode so many people can now
record<00:05:15.340> it's<00:05:16.340> ridiculous<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.510> will<00:05:17.750> be

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
record it's ridiculous and I will be
