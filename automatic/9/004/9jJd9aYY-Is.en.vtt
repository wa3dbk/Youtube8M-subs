00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.100
 the fresh team of ksv hessen 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.529
 Kassel is on the verge of imagination 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.420
 at the main sponsor vw in baunatal spoke 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.849
 anna sports chief frank ziemke with kevin 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 rough new entry in the gate of the lions yes 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 next to me is kevin rauhut new 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 theater at ksv hessen kevin das 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.380
 Team photo is taken 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.609
 The question then comes up when it is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.090
 because your place in the team already 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.160
 found 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 yes, I think the beginning is 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.390
 always very intensive training and there 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.539
 you can say that in a short 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.030
 time relatively fast as a team 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 finds and integrates itself 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 and I feel pretty fast 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.829
 moved here to Kassel where now 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
 also for almost four weeks here and from 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 That's why it's pretty easy for me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.539
 been made because the bulk lives 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 in kassel and you also outside 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.840
 training in preparation 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.100
 Of course, all the more because in the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.800
 lunch break you go something fast 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 eat and then you find it very fast 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620
 his place in the team 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.360
 they also get to see is even 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 already been mentioned what has the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 auspicious for this change of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.049
 cash on hand is hessen kassel in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.939
 absolute club of tradition in the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.960
 last year last year last 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.630
 season was not quite that good but the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.180
 Before that, of course, is in the relegation 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.270
 we have unfortunately failed a 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.030
 rise in the third league of the name 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.340
 Alone alone is crucial for 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.259
 for my change wait as I said 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 a traditional club is here are here 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.799
 are fans as well so that the whole 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.600
 infrastructure here is the right 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.939
 Training places of the trainer of course 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.860
 which, of course, a certain 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.530
 The decisive factor is that I already have it out 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 the regionall west side actually 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.689
 know quite well and therefore that was 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.030
 Of course the point is the fans very much 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.040
 looking forward to this very new ksv 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 team what can fans expect 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.549
 in the coming season yes I think 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.380
 the fans can play in honest football 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.860
 expect us because we are a boy 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.399
 troops 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.229
 we all still have goals and we have 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.579
 I do not think big the established 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.170
 players who rest here and you 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.610
 simply rake money home 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.590
 I'll say that I'm here anyway 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.000
 not to earn and therefore need 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.280
 we are a whole lot in it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 work out and we have a lot 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.649
 to make up for the last season already 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.910
 alone but I'll tell you how 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.250
 said a young troupe in the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.660
 hungry troop we want honest 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 but most of all, they play football 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.000
 a football of the forward 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.010
 maybe it's aligned too 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.750
 many goals still defensively good 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.040
 are and I think that's the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.780
 give and make important for the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.680
 Fans also have a lot of traffic jams 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.239
 to find stadiums 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.530
 that sounds good, I say 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.489
 Thank you very much and much success for the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.489
 thank you thank you very much
