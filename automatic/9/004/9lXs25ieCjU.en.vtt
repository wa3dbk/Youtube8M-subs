00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.360 
absolutely love this I have multiples of
this<00:03:14.580> um<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:16.290> noticed<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.920> little<00:03:17.250> bit

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
this um I have noticed it's a little bit

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.070 
this um I have noticed it's a little bit
inconsistent<00:03:17.820> with<00:03:18.390> how<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.720> cut<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
inconsistent with how they cut the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.720 
inconsistent with how they cut the
bristles<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.920> kind<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> downside

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
bristles so that is kind of a downside

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.810 
bristles so that is kind of a downside
but<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:21.810> love<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:22.320> brush<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.800> amazing<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
but I love this brush it's amazing and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.520 
but I love this brush it's amazing and
for<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:24.420> dollar<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.870> really<00:03:25.140> can't<00:03:25.380> go<00:03:25.500> wrong

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
for one dollar you really can't go wrong

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.020 
for one dollar you really can't go wrong
so<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.220> looks<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:26.970> just

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
so this just looks like this it's just

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.900 
so this just looks like this it's just
there<00:03:27.269> like<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.660> said<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.140> dollar<00:03:28.910> eyeshadow

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
from them I've gotten in different sets

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.170 
from them I've gotten in different sets
so<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.900> have<00:03:46.410> like<00:03:46.860> AI<00:03:47.130> think<00:03:47.370> six<00:03:47.850> piece<00:03:48.150> set

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
so I have like AI think six piece set

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.240 
so I have like AI think six piece set

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.890 
and then a five piece set that I got for
Christmas<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> while<00:03:51.360> ago<00:03:51.510> or<00:03:51.720> by

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900

birthday or something weird like that
but<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.150> guess<00:03:54.390> it's<00:03:54.570> not<00:03:54.690> weird<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.110> know

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
but I guess it's not weird but you know

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.310 
but I guess it's not weird but you know
what<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.350> mean<00:03:55.380> but<00:03:56.040> anyways<00:03:56.519> um<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.900> love<00:03:58.110> all

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
what I mean but anyways um so I love all

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.990 
what I mean but anyways um so I love all
of<00:03:58.350> my<00:03:58.590> ecotools<00:03:59.040> brushes<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.730> definitely

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
of my ecotools brushes I definitely

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.390 
of my ecotools brushes I definitely
would<00:04:00.180> recommend<00:04:00.209> getting<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.440> five<00:04:01.860> piece

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
would recommend getting the five piece

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.670 
would recommend getting the five piece
set<00:04:02.720> because<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.840> one<00:04:03.930> has<00:04:04.110> like<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.380> blush

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
set because that one has like a blush

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.520 
set because that one has like a blush
brush<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.160> believe<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.850> it<00:04:06.840> has<00:04:07.080> like<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.500> eye

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
brush I believe and it has like the eye

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.620 
brush I believe and it has like the eye
brushes<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.489> all<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.760> fun<00:04:08.910> stuff<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.420> this

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
brushes and all that fun stuff so this

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.390 
brushes and all that fun stuff so this
one<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.110> my<00:04:10.260> absolute<00:04:10.709> favorite<00:04:11.070> blending

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
one is my absolute favorite blending

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.979 
one is my absolute favorite blending
brush<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.670> have<00:04:11.760> ever<00:04:11.970> used<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.450> my<00:04:12.540> life<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
brush I have ever used in my life and

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.740 
brush I have ever used in my life and
it's<00:04:13.769> from<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.549> five<00:04:14.790> piece<00:04:15.180> set<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.570> was

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
it's from that five piece set that I was

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.039 
it's from that five piece set that I was
just<00:04:15.900> talking<00:04:16.320> about<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.600> looks<00:04:18.630> like<00:04:18.840> that

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
just talking about so it looks like that

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.810 
just talking about so it looks like that
and<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> set<00:04:19.799> all<00:04:20.040> together<00:04:20.370> costs<00:04:20.669> about

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
and the set all together costs about

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.690 
and the set all together costs about
nine<00:04:21.120> dollars<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.680> five<00:04:22.919> brushes<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.610> it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
nine dollars for the five brushes so it

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.250 
nine dollars for the five brushes so it
kind<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:23.940> evens<00:04:24.060> out<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.570> being<00:04:24.750> pretty<00:04:24.960> cheap

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
kind of evens out to being pretty cheap

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.140 
kind of evens out to being pretty cheap
but<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:26.220> absolutely

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
but I absolutely

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.939 
but I absolutely
this<00:04:27.330> brush<00:04:27.540> it's<00:04:27.750> amazing<00:04:28.259> for<00:04:28.290> just<00:04:28.710> putting

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
this brush it's amazing for just putting

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.290 
this brush it's amazing for just putting
on<00:04:29.040> your<00:04:29.070> highlight<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.729> just<00:04:29.880> blending

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
on your highlight and just blending

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.629 
on your highlight and just blending
everything<00:04:30.449> together<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.860> think<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.310> will<00:04:32.370> use

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
like the tips are harder because they're

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.260 
like the tips are harder because they're
like<00:05:25.440> more<00:05:25.650> cheaply<00:05:26.070> made<00:05:26.400> than<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.120> ones
