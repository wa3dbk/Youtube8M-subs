00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 Dear friends 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.130
 set aside your gadgets turn away from 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.640
 your headset 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.640
 secret and paper because two 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.950
 in one pretty paper terrain lived 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.820
 elk named aristotle and woodpecker by 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.820
 kip tube name 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.190
 once aristotle and tek tek 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.350
 went to the river to catch fish 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.490
 friends were lucky that day the fish was eating 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:59.770
 very good catch fish ari set foot 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.960
 goes shots went home they are vigorous 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.690
 walked along the forest path or rather say 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.140
 this aristotle was going and tek tek was flying in 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.510
 far 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.810
 because every shit is decent 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.150
 fly rather than walking suddenly friends 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.950
 stopped they saw under the tree 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.680
 the little white hare is so nice 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.880
 Bunny probably he got lost and wants 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 eat let's feed him no bale hares not 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.000
 eat fish to strange people these hares a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.020
 what do they eat like that 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.630
 rabbits love carrots and cabbage should be 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.270
 let's take it with you it will be yours 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.230
 a pet and we give him for it 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.870
 carrots and cabbage paper invented 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.130
 But I must say that in paper terrain 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.370
 paper words 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 meant well and words are paper 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.710
 invented in paper language meant 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.230
 thought up well friends brought 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.290
 Zaichenko home and gave him a carrot 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.660
 they themselves hung the fish on the ropes and lay down 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.660
 sleep in your paper beds a 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.020
 terrible happened and someone night 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.970
 stole our fish and really fish 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.520
 almost half less 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.360
 apparently someone snuck into the kitchen and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.340
 stole our fish they made apparently 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.370
 night listen 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.570
 and more we have not lost anything not 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.400
 only fish 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:46.820
 I didn't see anyone here 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.060
 probably on hare it means nobody 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:55.820
 did not see but someone still pulled the fish 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.800
 here it is necessary to think of paper here it is necessary 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.520
 paper 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.590
 act when aristotle was pondering 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.860
 there is always something played on his 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860
 double bass 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.530
 caught moths sticky nets 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.709
 They are where mittens sorry Cossack 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.489
 i just wanted to catch a mitten like not 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.950
 I came out on paper 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.680
 our fish 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.340
 take the box and put it in our 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.220
 hare throw fish there 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.919
 what do you think bale that we have in the box 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.889
 there the hare and the fish Aristotle discovered 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:07.299
 but in a box instead of a hare or fish 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:10.810
 sat a white cat what is this year and where is our 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.639
 bunny showed bale box in which 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.640
 still sat white with 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.329
 then you will finish 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.590
 it's just like a piece of paper nobody here 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:29.720
 the fish didn't steal it ate our home 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:34.680
 pet can be true hares do not eat 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:38.040
 well it's not exactly a hare meet this 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.530
 someone hare aristotle pulled a hare out 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.290
 boxes and pulled him short hare 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.020
 tail tail stretched out and became a long 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.780
 Bunny too and became short 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.780
 now the hare than not started rolling back 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.150
 draw the torso of a cat hare and tail 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.060
 with ducks 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:07.130
 cut all the excess make slots for 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.130
 ears and tail and collect the toy mixture 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.760
 It turned out okato hare stayed live 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.430
 Our friends I did not feed him 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.130
 fresh fish and the freshest carrots and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.650
 then he was pretty purring or drumming 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.290
 on the table front legs probably on 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.040
 language to hares both meant 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.250
