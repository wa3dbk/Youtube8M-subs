00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello guys with you again Andrei 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 ears on fire musician from more than 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.049
 twenty years too are usually divided into 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.150
 2 types 1 are the pillars of the genre on which 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.609
 holding all the basics they don't 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 experimenting with the sounds of playing what 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 they are just used to hearing from them but doing 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 it is immaculate 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 I would call such teams 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.369
 metallica and sidisi and motorhead 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 and others like them the second type is not afraid 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 experiment 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.309
 even more due to their experiments 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.620
 many others often develop 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.770
 music genres are examples of similar 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 groups i would call craft work pink floyd 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.719
 and maybe even bits of guys from marilyn 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.530
 manson and if anyone does not know it is 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.250
 what a group 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.469
 I personally would refer to the second type for 26 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 years of existence they tried a bunch 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.160
 different genres ranging from metal 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.379
 gothic-industrial, and much more to come 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420
 these experiments were successful only in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.460
 or a different degree that's why 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.189
 most albums of the group were taken 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 differently as critics did the final 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.390
 listeners 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 but at the same time common kidney manson 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 traced among all the records 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.159
 and now it's time for a new record 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.270
 which is called p l and n 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.619
 pale and emperors and i'm ready 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 assume it is in honor 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.020
 traditional mushroom mister manson yet 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.600
 long before the release of the record itself 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.409
 the musicians said that the experiment would 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.499
 and that they will be very unusual 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.140
 bright visible and when for approximately 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:44.869
 month before the official release date of the album 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.810
 got shot himself great horror 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.240
 stated that impressions and emotions for 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.600
 he drew this plate far 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.819
 forgotten but hot in people 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.149
 The first thought was that there as a result 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.200
 will be how it will sound 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.659
 wariness disappeared without a trace 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.509
 imagine listening the very first 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.459
 track killer stranger it became clear that 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.519
 music really blows hot southern 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.980
 blown but at the same time it keeps 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.010
 all the characteristics of the team mansell 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.879
 &amp; ana paula nihilism detachment and and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.220
 forgotten as they 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.470
 slowly and slowly developing 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.590
 the disc does not get bored 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.840
 and does not tire surprisingly the right moment 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 the atmosphere is diluted by brisk tracks 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.260
 or just active moments though 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.000
 Most of the backbone of the album consists of 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.720
 slow compositions of river and more 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.880
 calm usually like i put 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.739
 flaw but not this time at all in 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.560
 case in this mason records i 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.180
 experienced a rather strange mixture 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.090
 surprise and pleasure at the same time 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.639
 I really liked her but I 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.739
 can't describe all the usual words in 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.900
 what sense was created at all 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.030
 the impression is that for writing music for 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.549
 this record guys on the nile 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.310
 freelance jack white leaving texts 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.190
 Mr. Maltsev himself also note 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.620
 that these same texts turned out also 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.260
 strong as in previous works 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.090
 maestro they are metaphorical abstract 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.639
 exactly as much as it is 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.790
 requires a general atmosphere and music yes 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:22.400
 they are deep but moderately not so much 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.430
 the impression was different 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.650
 multiple meanings plm is one of 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.799
 when you are nothing special 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.930
 wait but you get this work bright 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.690
 an example of how you need and how it costs 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.120
 experiment with any team i 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.250
 I definitely recommend this work 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.310
 familiarization to all who are one or another 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.890

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.659
 lovers or just an admirer 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.150
