00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.890
 Hello everyone today as promised rented 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.580
 full review 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:17.340
 cycling computer axis for and there are 820 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:25.939
 dealt with these features want with you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.939
 share settings what i have for him 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:37.840
 In general, the time is initially set 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:41.840
 time is pressed here concerned and 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:48.489
 exhibited agility 33 minutes 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.489
 if the clock is inserted 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.300
 press the fashion button goes clock 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.620
 from the act of light you insert 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.850
 automatically after four seconds 3-4 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.280
 seconds it takes its place 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.880
 the simplest is the push of a button 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.670
 moller 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.850
 that is, the clock is set in this place 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.640
 cycling computer 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.770
 the clock that is, the stopwatch started 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 that is, this car wash is purely for itself there 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:33.100
 one of the functions may come in handy 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.929
 then does the total travel time go then 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.929
 have it automatically turn on when 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.200
 how you humiliate a bike 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.850
 time starts automatically that is and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.100
 it is fixed on every trip then 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.100
 have it need to reset if you want 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.460
 fix separate as time then 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.579
 I will say you can not reset the trip 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 the total time will be displayed that is 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:12.470
 day week week month 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:15.769
 next distance function distance 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.940
 she speaks for itself 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.819
 distance 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:28.970
 that is , how fast do you see 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:33.000
 average one more odometer function 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.260
 fix fully traversed 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.209
 mileage over all time that is and 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.160
 it is advisable not to dump well would you 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.780
 knew the sultan just kilometers dashed off 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.819
 same use 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:56.910
 Bike I have this feature without dropping 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:59.459
 that is, I hurt feed 64 kilometers 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.920
 that is, not particularly skated there to work with 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:08.190
 work after work in physics 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.290
 takbir max speed is me 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.989
 developed on my bike the maximum 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.220
 speed is enemy 5 5 it is fixed then you 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.030
 automatically with is the average speed 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.400
 how many you drove ie i dropped it 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.450
 that is, initially for each trip 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.500
 how to kick off the trip to 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:36.989
 know average speed and minimum 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.560
 drove today is the number of revolutions then 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.830
 there is 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.830
 especially no matter how 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.140
 goes still extra this feature 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.200
 calories that is after each trip 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.060
 it shows you how many calories and 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.090
 dumped ie I donâ€™t know correctly 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.360
 shows exactly this function or not well 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.650
 as if 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.480
 extra bonus so average 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:12.910
 approximately still fix how many calories 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:19.090
 so the most important thing is that there are some 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:22.430
 cycle computer owners complain that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.270
 Chinese bad computers are not right 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.540
 I show that is, I checked this one 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.870
 one hundred meters in the stadium 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.080
 that is, it shows perfectly that is 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.040
 circles reel clearly that is 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.040
 show shows
