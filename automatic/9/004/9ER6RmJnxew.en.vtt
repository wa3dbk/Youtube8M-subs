00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.759
 what roll band how are you welcome 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.589
 in the fine manner of today's Tuesday 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.589
 something reminds us to see 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.350
 June 25, 2013 I am a kid and so 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.090
 let's talk about nintendo 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.070
 specifically a problematic part 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.580
 of nintendo that has had the wing for 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.670
 here 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 block in block region for 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 that they do not know is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.570
 lock that is put on some consoles 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.239
 so you can not import games of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.329
 another region that is not yours is to say 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.510
 all the games you buy in america 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.030
 you can play them in your purchased console 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.650
 in america without any problem 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 the joke comes when a game comes out 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.920
 japan that you say wey is that it is not going to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.860
 to leave here never in life but I am 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.230
 Japanese and I can send danger in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.970
 some internet page and playable on 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.350
 my console is American then no no 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.510
 you can that is the blocking of region 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 precisely that it did go out there all 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.820
 you can only play on the consoles 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.750
 from there 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 and asia europe and america are the regions 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.220
 then we can not import games nor 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 of europe nor of asia 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 if we do not have a console from her to 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.870
 play them because our console will not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.870
 it will not pull 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 the wing in this block or region the wi and 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.760
 he has it and the tri 10 has it 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.710
 the normal 10 did not have it in fact I 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.410
 I have the hotel game 2 that is this 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.390
 He came here in America I could play me 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.640
 I was very caught and treated in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.050
 get your tickets sequel 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.230
 windows that is another east of the windows 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.910
 Well this game is European but like the 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.250
 10 does not have to block it engineer can 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.840
 carry as final and I'm taking a lot 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.630
 in explaining that that origins block is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.610
 the point now the news is that there is in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.280
 this time a request through 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.820
 different means by twitter for me 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.370
 bears for forums like my home that are 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.770
 trying to make nintendo remove 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.870
 this blockade of the tri 10 and the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:25.080
 wing of achieving things like not blade 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.930
 as pandora's tower as the last story 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.210
 that was a game that brought them to 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.710
 this one could become a reality 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.620
 could you import it from japanese let's say 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.300
 He left today today they buy it if you buy it 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.150
 rather what I do travel and what 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.290
 you would have at most a week not 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.230
 wait two years for it to come out 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.879
 of course if you know Japanese I do not know I do not 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.579
 would do but European games for example 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.329
 European games that are in Spanish or 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.849
 which are in English can be imported 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.650
 easily above all imagine yourself in my 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.599
 case that I want to play from the windows 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.599
 and just save Europe 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.890
 I if that was the current generation I 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.840
 I could not buy the game because I did not 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.720
 I would have case of needing gentry diese 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.510
 European to be able to play good band 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.330
 the joke is that he is very strong this 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.850
 request what happens that there is one 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.650
 let's say a little background of 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.500
 requests that he has been doing 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.240
 nintendo and in general to companies 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.040
 are those of operation king 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.440
 reinfeldt that is these three games that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.090
 I mentioned that they came from wii is the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.020
 request of no of rm in playstation 4 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.640
 and does not have rm this the request standards 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.780
 and in the complaints or ridicule of the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.120
 xbox one users and they made for 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.850
 back your policies now it's your turn 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.000
 to nintendo let's see if actually 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.810
 do this in fact one of the notes is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.720
 that are going to bring the game of er vaughn 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.580
 on this side of the pond because what 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.520
 They asked a lot through my bears 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.099
 according to that is nintendo that they listen 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.060
 to the fans through bibers because it's the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.820
 principal let's say source of this kind of 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.290
 requests to be removed from the blockade 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.889
 of region and that can be done very 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.050
 simple with a firmware doubt and already as 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.430
 if nothing do an update 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.620
 10 and save the tri wii ready and 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.700
 remove block and we'll see if it continues 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.090
 by the way they are going to start being and 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.090
 animals 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.470
 and it will not be tomorrow percent already left the 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.810
