00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
should help out a little bit but what

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.460 
should help out a little bit but what
you<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.879> try<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:06.000> begin<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.049> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you could try and do is to begin with is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.969 
you could try and do is to begin with is
maybe<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.540> vinegar<00:01:09.540> white<00:01:09.930> vinegar<00:01:09.979> what

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

maybe to use vinegar white vinegar what
you<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> pour<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you do is you pour this in as the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
you do is you pour this in as the
machine<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.080> taking<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> water<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.130> use

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
about a link to that liter and a half

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.990 
about a link to that liter and a half
then<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.250> could<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> soap

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
then I could put it in the soap

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
then I could put it in the soap
dispenser<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.409> machine<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.799> filling<00:01:20.189> up
