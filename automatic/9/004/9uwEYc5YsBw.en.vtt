00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.990 

and<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> leaves<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.710> power<00:02:32.920> up<00:02:33.160> there<00:02:33.400> with

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and it leaves the power up there with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.460 
and it leaves the power up there with
along<00:02:34.360> with<00:02:34.390> your<00:02:34.720> original<00:02:34.870> points<00:02:35.410> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
along with your original points you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.050 
along with your original points you
already<00:02:35.650> had<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:36.010> your<00:02:36.130> inventory<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.790> guess

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
already had in your inventory I guess

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.840 
already had in your inventory I guess
and<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.380> can<00:02:38.620> pick<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.370> pop<00:02:39.670> it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
and you can pick it up and just pop it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.750 
and you can pick it up and just pop it
all<00:02:39.940> your<00:02:40.060> points<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:44.130> think<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> maximum

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
all your points I think the maximum

all your points I think the maximum
amount<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:46.090> points<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.480> can<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.900> your

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.740 
amount of points you can have in your
bank<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.130> 250,000<00:02:49.090> because<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.540> see<00:02:49.720> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750
