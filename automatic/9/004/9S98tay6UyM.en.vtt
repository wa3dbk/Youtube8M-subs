 downloading a new hard everything is 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 we open it we have to open 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.920
 minecraft to create certain files 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 out there, they can create a world 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 new out there because they let it load and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 this all the files that we are going to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 use will be in on links in the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.000
 description of the video so that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.170
 this forum and we're going to download the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.409
 install simply we will give it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.570
 install and accept nothing else was going to stay 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.520
 force installed on our computer 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.409
 after 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.039
 what is the magiclown we have it 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.439
 run as administrator and good 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.140
 let's minimize in this window 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.479
 we have to click on that top there 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.159
 let's click on new and you have to 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.069
 We will not write a configuration 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.039
 1.6 point 2 it is optional to put the name 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.740
 they want but it is for 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.229
 identify them and in environment like 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.179
 can see says classic low 1.6 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.259
 points 2 we have to select the one that 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:49.009
 says force 1.6 points 2 force 10.2 bla 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.659
 blah blah and here what we are going to do 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.100
 is to click on maniche 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.439
 this is going 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.990
 open our mods folder like 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.830
 can see we are in mineira pereira 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 mods and inside this folder is where 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.380
 let's copy and paste or cut and 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.539
 paste that you like the mod of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.030

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.790
 we paste there and they are already installed 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 automatically the mods as you can see 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.690
 below are activated with the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.640
 popcorn and that means they are 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.680
 this then already activated without needing 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.620
 be copying things in our home 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.150
 Weigh them arribita in the tab of 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250
 advanced let's put our 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.130
 resolution that we want 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.630
 I have 280 280 x 720 in memory almost 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.590

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.610
 click on test when we click on 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.680
 test this king system error is going to appear 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.630

 this one is force installed and good and here 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.670
 we can already see here inside minecraft 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.270
 we can check this because we're already 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.030
 running 1.6 point two comfort and mod 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.100
 of shaders now let's press and skype 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.380
 on our keyboard and we're going to go to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.930
 the video options there we're going to go 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.270
 to shaders and shaders open 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.980
 shader pack and we will open this 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.670
 window that is also inside 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.710
 from minecraft stop going to minecraft 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.410
 steiger bucks and this is where we are going to 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.060
 copy our shader bucks that are going to 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.250
 do this one that is the one of carriÃ³ 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.320
 knicks and silver those two are going to 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.250
 be in the link of the description if the 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.290
 from Bom Bom Wey Vincero is going slow 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.150
 occupy the shield tour that are that 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.310
 It is made specifically for cards 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.710
 intel graphics that are what I give you 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.080
 they bring all the integrated ones but then if 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.390
 You can check from a little taste 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.450
 the d 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.880
 on one side be waiting 'which is that of 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.800
 Carri knicks well this and run it well 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.250
 they already did it and then here as 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.310
 you can see it is moving the pastito 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.440
 the leaves of the trees the communes of 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.480
 those mothers I do not know what they are and if you 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.340
 they say that shadows are textured 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.350
 they are not textures are shadows as is 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.670
 nothing but they are a little lower 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.500
 than those that come in the versions 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.630
 ultra are the normal versions of 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.190
 shaders here as you can see change the 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.020
 time for them to see as well 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.150
 change the position of the shadow so that 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.020
 see that it is not text trick so 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.050
 everything is therefore within the model 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.430
 center if you look here for dawn and 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.040
 the shadows change position 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.700
 Obviously and if they are doing very well 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.430
 slow this the minecraft is already with the 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.260
 of catfish with the carrion pack and c's 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.970
 let's go to the options the 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.590
 graphics let's switch to pastures 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.870
 fast this the smoot line with the light 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.760
 soft we have to turn it off as they can 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.090
 see here because nothing else can stop the 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.350
 video and pause it and copy my settings 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.840
 almost everything has to be turned off 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.580
 the clouds are very many 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.520
 resources so why do we turn them off and already 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.050
 gives us a little more frames per 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.220
 second channel I hope you have 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.800
 enjoyed this little comment 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.840
 Any doubt write to me there in the 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.300
 the comments I will try to 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.770
 answer as quickly as possible team 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.510
 As you can see, we have our 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.400
 resource back so it does not look so ugly 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.680
 this already with the graphics down and 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.230
 good he left us with this little lamb that has 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.950
 been world of scared and good see you 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.950
 after
