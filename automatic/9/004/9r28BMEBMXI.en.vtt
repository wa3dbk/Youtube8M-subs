00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 that people ask me the question this 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.279
 that I usually do what I do to them 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.259
 answer is that I am like a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.380
 nurse in a maternity ward has to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.800
 to take care of moms and then babies 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.800
 after birth 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.310
 and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.310
 and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.119
 the student certainly is that at 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.259
 early I wanted to work with the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 animals because I grew up on a 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.699
 shut down then ethernet and it trotted me 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.680
 in megÃ¨ve time and I were discussing 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.970
 time I 'm done as if it's because 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.559
 that I'm looking for that I'd been seeing on 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.149
 internet all they had found 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.890
 a workout session then I 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.239
 really seen a difference 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.739
 tasks as can be compared with 1 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.900
 nurse then a doctor at the hospital 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 but it's my nurse what contact 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.019
 live with the patient once he knows 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.489
 what I was looking for what is it 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.559
 does a technician in hundreds but 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.329
 Well, I have to say that if the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.879
 right arm left arm 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.489
 veterinarian's brain stack at the beginning of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.870
 course we really see teaching or 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.030
 to students how to behave with 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.219
 the request how to read his behavior 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.289
 how to manipulate the born litigation 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 then when are comfortable there we arrive 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.460
 with basic care so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 the administration of drugs by the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640
 mouth in the eyes in others 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.229
 how to clean ears as in 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.880
 cut and grids after that we will 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.229
 to arrive in care a little more 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.780
 demanding the administration of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.220
 their drugs by injection 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.380
 blood sample 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.330
 when are good enough in all these 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.039
 areas of care we arrive at the top 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.539
 level anesthesia because our 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.670
 technicians will help us also to 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.069
 do the anesthetized then assistant 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.190
 surgery precedes the internships in 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.929
 external environment when our fine 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.610
 are doing what they CEGEP 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.410
 usually do not get tired of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.090
 three main lines li clinical 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.250
 veterinary options veterinary 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 otherwise it's going to be in the circles of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.890
 looking for it in 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.679
 government laboratories 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.899
 pharmaceutical academics that's it 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.459
 really the two biggest ones to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.379
 do some students work 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.640
 before the most to work with the 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.840
 big animals or do I like it 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.729
 plus it's really what they 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.459
 animal handling gossips times of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.039
 catheters yet left to nothing if 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.780
 precisely times the vaccines that especially 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.759
 what I like most is my family 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 turned in the morning really to see my 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.900
 cows how are they going and if we want 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.520
 the day before to see the follow up and then 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.020
 really make sure everybody is going 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.330
 well since I can sleep in peace is 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 this is what I like most strong but 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.780
 we have several health tactics 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.640
 animal that work with us then 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.440
 the mandate group they have is to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.260
 watch the animals on 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.390
 water treatment 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.459
 to attend the Masses and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.720
 do the first exam who are the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.610
 first line then when a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 complication of their internal efforts to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.530
 montreux mans they are the ones who have the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.299
 charges the responsibility of animals 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.829
 if monitoring of the animals because 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.900
 these are values â€‹â€‹it's really 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.879
 give birth to the calves because we do not 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 the plane that our hands then that's 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.290
 really it's rewarding when you know 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.209
 that the corn 20 because of you then the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.040
 torre too because we are everything 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.879
 wrongs that we made and therefore those 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.840
 all need assistance 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.849
 it's really important to be 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.849
 water that's for sure I love 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.470
 and
