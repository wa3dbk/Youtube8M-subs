 dpa 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.829
 Prof 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.939
 Dani Alves first season in Barcelona sees him and the club in the direction 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.049
 Championship machines and also in the Champions League they are considered great 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.820
 Favorites traded on his last 8 months look back FC Eddersheim II 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.029
 fizzle comes over his passion for the club 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.029
 his teammates and his second tournament in St 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.679
 what counts now is 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.019
 a dream came true because as a player in Barcelona I can 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.570
 Enjoy what I love most 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.850
 my passion of football and I enjoy it for myself 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 most important and if we win then you can build better 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 I believe that in football "No matter what competition wins and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.380
 Losing time is important only that you have the beautiful moments in football 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.320
 Enjoy and SimÃ£o Mans we have a real honors strong team in the first 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.730
 Moment the Emmental 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.150
 Picture Doris guessed so in my opinion is in the gate of the gate-guarantee 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.340
 he is Mister Torfabrik 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.430
 white 2 Uri 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 it's his style 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 his class he hates 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.550
 but not Messi is the absolute football god 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.640
 Russell Brown has been 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.710
 I think it should primarily think in the same direction 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.659
 then you just understand each other better 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.140
 and I think that's just one language in football Bayer is football 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 play 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.150
 Freedom when I really or made plans when we talk 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.870
 then there is a connection between us and I understand myself 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.220
 just better with her, it's clear 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.620
 If you're eating together, a slight improvement in the community 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.060
 it is also easier 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.190
 remember 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.390
 Santel transmission mast made by the grandfather 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.770
 Like all players he also has great respect for Pepper the Rola that in 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 his first year in office has managed to revive the team 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.400
 the president al larger 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.509
 what i believe 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.360
 that he demands a certain professionalism from the whole team 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.959
 he himself was a successful player proving what the players like or 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:18.969
 neither 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.329
 He does not need very long prudent dying out 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.359
 I think that the more time you need competent it gets harder 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.359
 good profiles and life to find the place 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.389
 He tries to pass on his ideas to victims and thoughts to the team 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.739
 and the truth is that we players are very capable in this regard 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.540
 and I think we made it to a very good one 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.639
 Team these relationships to become so far the professional 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.180
 in the moments Google must be present we are too and have it 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:03:01.199
 help each other whenever necessary he is afraid of his job 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.199
 Neururer 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.989
 He joins them who won twice in the Uefa Cup and the Super Cup and now wants to 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.579
 the European with Ivy still missing in its collection 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.309
 Perception job market SN 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.070
 to win the Champions League 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.390
 Dream 1 is a title that every player dreams for 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.929
 something for me 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 it is the second time that this enjoyment comes 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.159
 It motivates me where it is fun 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.209
 a club like Barcelona Rostock has very good chances to win this title 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.679
 win 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:37.709
 especially 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.449
 if we play like we are at the moment, "this would be something very special 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.449
 Winning the competition 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.089
 to be shipped 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.939
 which we already are the team 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:58.999
 If you want to beat them, the defending champions are again powerful in their favor 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.639
 keep out of the way 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.700
 also because they are a player 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.689
 like Ronaldo in their ranks 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.099
 but you finally get to a point in the competition 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.779
 where you can virtually no longer choose the opponents 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.150
 Denon if we want to win the Champions League 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.849
 unfortunately I had to beat the best 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.560
 we just have to be ready to beat everyone because it's a very 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.219
 demanding competition and if you want to win this there must be 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:30.360
 beat teams and that is the profile and need to focus
