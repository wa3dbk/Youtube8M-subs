00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
glitch on skate 3 which is called the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.430 
glitch on skate 3 which is called the
backwards<00:00:13.850> man<00:00:13.940> speed<00:00:14.540> glitch<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.170> first

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
backwards man speed glitch the first

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.960 
backwards man speed glitch the first
thing<00:00:15.590> I<00:00:15.710> want<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:15.890> do<00:00:16.039> is<00:00:16.070> give<00:00:16.369> props<00:00:16.760> to

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
thing I want to do is give props to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.500 
thing I want to do is give props to
whoever<00:00:17.390> it<00:00:17.810> was<00:00:17.990> a<00:00:18.050> founder<00:00:18.650> of<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:19.160> glitch

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
whoever it was a founder of this glitch

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.810 
whoever it was a founder of this glitch
because<00:00:20.510> now<00:00:21.110> that<00:00:21.140> we're<00:00:21.800> all<00:00:21.830> using<00:00:22.250> it<00:00:22.640> and

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
because now that we're all using it and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.660 
because now that we're all using it and
it's<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:23.330> fun<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.869> do<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:24.860> basically<00:00:25.310> what<00:00:25.640> it

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
it's so fun to do so basically what it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.550 
it's so fun to do so basically what it
is<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.210> um<00:00:27.100> here<00:00:28.100> in<00:00:28.600> slow<00:00:29.600> motion<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:30.260> even

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
is is um here in slow motion it even

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.290 
is is um here in slow motion it even
goes<00:00:30.680> fast<00:00:31.070> too<00:00:31.430> so

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:52.960 

as<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.680> well<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.480> mean

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.040 

so<00:00:53.630> basically<00:00:54.200> what<00:00:54.650> this<00:00:55.070> glitch<00:00:55.520> does<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.900> is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
so basically what this glitch does it is

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.730 
so basically what this glitch does it is
hard<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.470> do<00:00:57.770> like<00:00:58.130> first<00:00:58.490> try<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.030> everything

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
hard to do like first try and everything

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.400 
hard to do like first try and everything
but<00:01:00.740> I'm<00:01:00.950> still<00:01:01.520> trying<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.970> do<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.450> a<00:01:02.540> lot<00:01:02.750> I<00:01:03.260> do

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
but I'm still trying to do it a lot I do

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.060 
but I'm still trying to do it a lot I do
get<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.130> eventually<00:01:04.580> like<00:01:05.239> right<00:01:05.480> now<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:06.890> is

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
get it eventually like right now it is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.100 
get it eventually like right now it is
fun<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.550> do<00:01:07.970> though<00:01:09.790> so<00:01:10.790> in<00:01:11.090> order<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.420> do<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.900> it

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
fun to do though so in order to do it it

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200 
fun to do though so in order to do it it
involves<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.920> second<00:01:13.340> glitch<00:01:13.580> i<00:01:13.790> will<00:01:14.060> be

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
involves a second glitch i will be

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.440 
involves a second glitch i will be
uploading<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.840> video<00:01:15.050> on<00:01:15.260> how<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.530> do<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:16.040> on

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
uploading a video on how to do it on

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.420 
uploading a video on how to do it on
what<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.570> have<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.870> do<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.320> do<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.740> spawn

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
what you have to do is do the spawn

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.990 
what you have to do is do the spawn
glitch<00:01:19.790> first<00:01:20.210> we're<00:01:20.710> first<00:01:21.710> if<00:01:22.550> i<00:01:22.730> were<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:22.880> i

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
glitch first we're first if i were you i

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.969 
glitch first we're first if i were you i
placed<00:01:23.360> my<00:01:23.450> marker<00:01:23.960> somewhere<00:01:24.530> that's<00:01:24.740> like

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
placed my marker somewhere that's like

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.719 
placed my marker somewhere that's like
empty<00:01:25.550> before<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.660> even<00:01:26.840> think<00:01:26.990> about<00:01:27.729> doing

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
empty before you even think about doing

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.690 
empty before you even think about doing
the<00:01:28.940> backwards<00:01:29.330> man<00:01:29.390> speak<00:01:29.840> llege<00:01:30.340> because<00:01:31.340> um

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the backwards man speak llege because um

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.340 
the backwards man speak llege because um
you<00:01:32.180> will<00:01:32.360> be<00:01:32.540> hitting<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.930> lot<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.110> obstacles

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
you will be hitting a lot of obstacles

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.920 
you will be hitting a lot of obstacles
if<00:01:33.920> everything<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:34.670> your<00:01:34.790> way<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:36.100> um

you bail just let him bail by himself if
you<00:02:00.890> don't<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> glitch<00:02:01.670> won't<00:02:01.940> work<00:02:02.380> now

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380

you right in the middle of the air you
hit<00:02:20.390> X<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.799> should<00:02:22.070> spawn<00:02:22.400> on

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
hit X like that and you should spawn on

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
hit X like that and you should spawn on
your<00:02:22.790> feet<00:02:23.090> then<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:23.959> back<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.230> your

your feet then you go back to your
marker<00:02:24.890> through<00:02:25.130> your<00:02:25.310> board<00:02:25.549> then<00:02:25.790> do<00:02:26.299> a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
marker through your board then do a

speed<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.770> do<00:04:45.979> get<00:04:46.220> like<00:04:46.460> um<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:48.140> much<00:04:48.320> be<00:04:48.710> 80

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
speed you do get like um so much be 80

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.290 
speed you do get like um so much be 80
if<00:04:50.390> you're<00:04:50.540> trying<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.930> do<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.320> oh<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:52.340> it's

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
if you're trying to do that oh but it's

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.450 
if you're trying to do that oh but it's
really<00:04:53.720> difficult<00:04:54.050> for<00:04:54.650> some<00:04:54.800> people<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:55.220> do

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
really difficult for some people to do

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.030 
really difficult for some people to do
so<00:04:55.820> that's<00:04:56.479> why<00:04:59.200> now<00:05:00.200> I'm<00:05:00.290> talking<00:05:00.560> about<00:05:00.620> not

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
so that's why now I'm talking about not

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.400 
so that's why now I'm talking about not
the<00:05:01.190> Cannonball<00:05:01.580> speed<00:05:01.870> I'm<00:05:02.870> talking<00:05:03.169> about<00:05:03.380> a

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
the Cannonball speed I'm talking about a

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.469 
the Cannonball speed I'm talking about a
different<00:05:03.650> glitch<00:05:04.220> which<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.850> backwards

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
different glitch which is a backwards

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.710 
different glitch which is a backwards
man<00:05:05.690> speed<00:05:06.050> glitch<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:07.160> it<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.490> difficult<00:05:08.300> for

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
man speed glitch so it is difficult for

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.440 
man speed glitch so it is difficult for
some<00:05:09.020> people<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.440> do<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.740> mean<00:05:10.130> I've<00:05:10.450> struggled

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
some people to do I mean I've struggled

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.490 
some people to do I mean I've struggled
with<00:05:11.690> it<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:12.500> many<00:05:12.650> times<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.840> just<00:05:15.320> follow

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
with it so many times so just follow

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.070 
with it so many times so just follow
everything<00:05:16.099> step<00:05:16.580> by<00:05:16.610> step<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.390> if<00:05:17.810> it's

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
everything step by step and if it's

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.530 
everything step by step and if it's
still<00:05:18.380> not<00:05:18.530> working

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
still not working

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.560 
still not working
harder<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.110> harder<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.790> should<00:05:22.060> work<00:05:22.090> for

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
harder and harder and it should work for

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.740 
harder and harder and it should work for
you<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:22.990> should<00:05:23.020> succeed<00:05:23.740> with<00:05:24.040> it<00:05:24.250> um<00:05:24.750> then

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
you you should succeed with it um then

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.890 
you you should succeed with it um then
proceed<00:05:26.650> with<00:05:26.920> your<00:05:27.070> glitch<00:05:27.400> on<00:05:27.850> you<00:05:28.480> can<00:05:28.750> do

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
proceed with your glitch on you can do

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.160 
proceed with your glitch on you can do
it<00:05:28.930> online<00:05:29.880> most<00:05:30.880> people<00:05:31.360> will<00:05:31.810> be<00:05:31.990> jealous

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
it online most people will be jealous

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.560 
it online most people will be jealous
because<00:05:32.560> everybody<00:05:33.520> who's<00:05:33.760> played<00:05:34.120> for<00:05:34.390> three

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
because everybody who's played for three

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.650 
because everybody who's played for three
and<00:05:35.230> knows<00:05:35.860> about<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.340> which<00:05:36.640> has<00:05:37.000> wanted<00:05:37.510> to
