okay<00:00:02.820> so<00:00:02.879> here<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.300> are<00:00:03.330> I'm<00:00:03.600> back<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:04.710> hooked<00:00:05.339> up

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay so here we are I'm back I hooked up

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.120 
okay so here we are I'm back I hooked up
the<00:00:06.359> two<00:00:07.280> pin<00:00:08.280> four<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.990> c2<00:00:10.349> driver's<00:00:10.830> side

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
the two pin four on the c2 driver's side

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.749 
the two pin four on the c2 driver's side
plug<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:13.009> what<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> do<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.639> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
plug and what I'm going to do here is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.640 
plug and what I'm going to do here is
I'm<00:00:14.880> actually<00:00:14.910> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> turn<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I'm actually going to turn on the the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.070 
I'm actually going to turn on the the
power<00:00:17.580> supply<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.300> we're<00:00:18.510> gonna<00:00:18.600> check<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
power supply and we're gonna check the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
power supply and we're gonna check the
fuel<00:00:19.320> gauge<00:00:19.500> okay<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.119> go<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.100> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
fuel gauge okay so here we go so the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300 
fuel gauge okay so here we go so the
power<00:00:23.310> supplies<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:24.350> okay<00:00:25.350> i'm<00:00:25.680> gonna<00:00:25.859> i'm

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
power supplies on okay i'm gonna i'm

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.700 
power supplies on okay i'm gonna i'm
going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:27.590> i'm<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> apply<00:00:29.900> or<00:00:30.900> turn<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
going to i'm going to apply or turn the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.220 
going to i'm going to apply or turn the
potentiometer<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> see<00:00:34.140> if

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
potentiometer and we're going to see if

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:43.920 
potentiometer and we're going to see if
it<00:00:34.380> changes<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> fuel<00:00:35.070> gauge<00:00:35.250> okay

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.750 

so<00:00:44.500> I<00:00:44.530> should<00:00:44.740> be<00:00:44.770> getting<00:00:45.160> there<00:00:45.280> sometime

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
so I should be getting there sometime

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.220 
so I should be getting there sometime
soon<00:00:46.000> now<00:00:46.150> keep<00:00:46.360> in<00:00:46.510> mind<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.810> fuel<00:00:47.050> gauge

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
soon now keep in mind the fuel gauge

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.370 
soon now keep in mind the fuel gauge
sending<00:00:47.680> unit<00:00:47.950> is<00:00:48.070> 90<00:00:48.430> ohms<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.960> oil

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
sending unit is 90 ohms and the oil

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.900 
sending unit is 90 ohms and the oil
pressure<00:00:50.860> gauge<00:00:51.010> there<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:51.580> go

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
pressure gauge there we go

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.210 
pressure gauge there we go
the<00:00:52.180> oil<00:00:52.300> pressure<00:00:52.540> gauge<00:00:52.930> is<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.560> 1300

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
the oil pressure gauge is up in the 1300

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.000 
the oil pressure gauge is up in the 1300
ohm<00:00:54.310> range<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:54.670> think<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:56.110> what<00:00:56.410> I've<00:00:56.530> what

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
ohm range I think and so what I've what

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.560 
ohm range I think and so what I've what
I<00:00:57.070> had<00:00:57.340> is<00:00:57.520> what<00:00:57.670> I've<00:00:57.790> got<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.030> do<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:58.390> just

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
I had is what I've got to do is I just

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.960 
I had is what I've got to do is I just
got<00:00:58.690> myself<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:59.110> 5<00:00:59.320> K<00:00:59.590> pot<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:00.250> kind<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.580> its

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
got myself a 5 K pot so it's kind of its

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.690 
got myself a 5 K pot so it's kind of its
kind<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.270> a<00:01:01.360> rough<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:03.160> kind<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.400> a<00:01:03.490> rough

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
kind of a rough it's kind of a rough

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.790 
kind of a rough it's kind of a rough
adjustment<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.170> doesn't<00:01:05.440> take<00:01:05.590> much

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
adjustment because it doesn't take much

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.820 
adjustment because it doesn't take much
to<00:01:05.980> get<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.370> move<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.700> much<00:01:06.970> but<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.830> can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
to get it to move this much but I can

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.350 
to get it to move this much but I can
make<00:01:08.950> an<00:01:09.100> accurate<00:01:09.400> measurement<00:01:09.790> if<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.060> wanted

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
make an accurate measurement if I wanted

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.300 
make an accurate measurement if I wanted
to<00:01:10.480> I<00:01:10.510> could<00:01:10.660> take<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.990> pot<00:01:11.200> use<00:01:11.710> my<00:01:11.950> standard

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
to I could take the pot use my standard

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.000 
to I could take the pot use my standard
D<00:01:12.610> mm<00:01:12.880> which<00:01:13.060> you'll<00:01:13.240> see<00:01:13.270> right<00:01:13.450> there<00:01:14.010> okay

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
D mm which you'll see right there okay

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.280 
D mm which you'll see right there okay
and<00:01:15.160> then<00:01:15.820> what<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.479> would<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.170> would

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and then what I would do is I would

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.740 
and then what I would do is I would
actually<00:01:17.619> make<00:01:18.510> measurement<00:01:19.510> on<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
actually make measurement on the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.980 
actually make measurement on the
resistor<00:01:20.260> at<00:01:21.130> half<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.820> 90<00:01:22.150> which<00:01:22.270> would<00:01:22.420> be<00:01:22.479> 45

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
resistor at half of 90 which would be 45

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.290 
resistor at half of 90 which would be 45
and<00:01:23.260> when<00:01:23.350> i<00:01:23.410> when<00:01:23.740> i<00:01:23.770> got<00:01:23.950> there<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:25.090> would

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
and when i when i got there that would

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.130 
and when i when i got there that would
be<00:01:25.380> exact<00:01:26.380> or<00:01:26.530> should<00:01:26.800> be<00:01:26.830> exactly<00:01:27.490> 1<00:01:28.240> 1/2<00:01:28.869> on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
be exact or should be exactly 1 1/2 on

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.180 
be exact or should be exactly 1 1/2 on
the<00:01:29.260> fuel<00:01:29.470> gauge<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.229> I'm<00:01:32.770> having<00:01:32.979> trouble

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
the fuel gauge so and I'm having trouble

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.190 
the fuel gauge so and I'm having trouble
I'm<00:01:33.700> trying<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.180> trying<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.690> get<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:34.990> thing

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
I'm trying to trying to get this thing

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.590 
I'm trying to trying to get this thing
right<00:01:35.380> up<00:01:35.560> on<00:01:35.710> on<00:01:36.550> half<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.910> tank<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.300> it's<00:01:37.420> kind

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
right up on on half a tank and it's kind

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.469 
right up on on half a tank and it's kind
of<00:01:37.630> hard<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.840> do<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.170> with<00:01:38.260> only<00:01:38.380> one<00:01:38.530> hand<00:01:38.950> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
of hard to do it with only one hand but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.600 
of hard to do it with only one hand but
you<00:01:40.479> can<00:01:40.630> see<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.920> see<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.190> fuel<00:01:42.430> gauge

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
you can see you can see the fuel gauge

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.800 
you can see you can see the fuel gauge
is<00:01:42.790> actually<00:01:43.150> working<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.540> way<00:01:43.630> that's

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
is actually working the way that's

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.560 
is actually working the way that's
supposed<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:45.520> pots<00:01:45.790> all<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.150> way<00:01:46.270> open

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
supposed to that pots all the way open

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.620 
supposed to that pots all the way open
now<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:46.990> when<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.070> tanks<00:01:48.430> empty<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.390> end

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
now so when the tanks empty and the end

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.750 
now so when the tanks empty and the end
the<00:01:49.810> sending<00:01:50.740> unit<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.130> tank<00:01:51.370> is<00:01:51.520> is

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
the sending unit and the tank is is

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.210 
the sending unit and the tank is is
completely<00:01:52.690> empty<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:53.410> thing<00:01:53.650> sits<00:01:53.950> right

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
completely empty this thing sits right

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.550 
completely empty this thing sits right
on<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.550> e<00:01:54.790> so<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.630> can<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.320> pretty<00:01:56.470> much

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
on the e so you can you can pretty much

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.750 
on the e so you can you can pretty much
Bank<00:01:56.980> on<00:01:58.320> when<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.470> thing<00:01:59.710> says<00:01:59.980> e<00:02:00.280> when<00:02:00.610> when
