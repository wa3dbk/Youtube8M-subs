boring hey you guys is advance map freak
and<00:00:08.429> I'm<00:00:08.519> handling<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> tutorial<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.840> this

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and I'm handling the tutorial and this

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.400 
and I'm handling the tutorial and this
time<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.860> am<00:00:10.980> doing<00:00:11.160> how<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:12.410> pokeballs

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
time I am doing how to do pokeballs

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.919 
time I am doing how to do pokeballs
quick<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.219> let's<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.549> straight<00:00:14.730> into<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
quick so let's get straight into it I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.080 
quick so let's get straight into it I
know<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> scripting<00:00:17.310> tutorial<00:00:17.460> but

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
know this is the scripting tutorial but

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.480 
know this is the scripting tutorial but
I<00:00:18.359> think<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> best<00:00:19.410> thing<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.710> us<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.279> is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
I think the best thing for us to do is

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.029 
I think the best thing for us to do is
to<00:00:20.789> create<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.480> sprite<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.170> you're<00:00:22.740> going

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to create the sprite that you're going

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.170 
to create the sprite that you're going
to<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:24.420> pokeball<00:00:25.130> basically<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.789> start<00:00:27.060> off

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to the pokeball basically to start off

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.259 
to the pokeball basically to start off
by<00:00:27.210> adding<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.900> extra<00:00:28.019> pattern<00:00:28.529> event<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
by adding an extra pattern event and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
by adding an extra pattern event and
placing<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> poke<00:00:30.570> ball<00:00:30.599> wherever<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.560> want

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
placing the poke ball wherever you want

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.030 
placing the poke ball wherever you want
I<00:00:32.840> know<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.930> doesn't<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.230> probable<00:00:34.800> yet

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I know it doesn't look like probable yet

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
I know it doesn't look like probable yet
that's<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.640> change<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.030> picture

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that's because you change the picture

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.910 
that's because you change the picture
number<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:37.670> 92<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.170> pokeball

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
number to 92 which is the pokeball

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.690 
number to 92 which is the pokeball
sprite

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
sprite

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
sprite
now<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.780> move<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.190> scripting<00:00:45.920> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
now we can move on to the scripting so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
now we can move on to the scripting so
we<00:00:46.980> start<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> script<00:00:47.670> how<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.480> would<00:00:48.809> any

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
we start the script how we would any

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.220 
we start the script how we would any
other<00:00:49.320> script<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.000> use<00:00:51.149> locks<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.930> ensure

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
other script and we use locks to ensure

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
other script and we use locks to ensure
that<00:00:52.260> anything<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> happening<00:00:53.670> while

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that anything of that happening while

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
that anything of that happening while
interacting<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> poops<00:00:55.320> ball<00:00:55.590> stops

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
interacting with the poops ball stops

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.950 
interacting with the poops ball stops
happening<00:00:56.870> then<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.109> move<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> remove

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
happening then we move on to remove

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.929 
happening then we move on to remove
sprite<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:02.210> we<00:01:03.210> type<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.309> person<00:01:05.309> event

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
sprite and we type in the person event

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
sprite and we type in the person event
number<00:01:06.630> after<00:01:07.350> number<00:01:08.119> person<00:01:09.119> event<00:01:09.780> number

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
number after number person event number

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
number after number person event number
so<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.549> case<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.090> would<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.650> full<00:01:13.850> up

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so in this case it would be full up

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.440 
so in this case it would be full up
Catania<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.830> case<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> before<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.390> we

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
Catania this this case is before now we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.370 
Catania this this case is before now we
actually<00:01:19.140> give<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> item<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> player<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
actually give the item to the player and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
actually give the item to the player and
active<00:01:23.130> movements<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:23.970> also<00:01:24.180> codes

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
active movements there are also codes

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.920 
active movements there are also codes
that<00:01:25.170> suggest<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.280> item<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> give<00:01:27.210> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that suggest which item to give so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.350 
that suggest which item to give so
unless<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> opened<00:01:28.829> before<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
unless this is what I opened before and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
unless this is what I opened before and
this<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.869> notepad<00:01:31.170> full<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> pretty<00:01:32.340> much

website advanced trigger webs calm and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
website advanced trigger webs calm and
well<00:01:41.850> let's<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.750> say<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> give<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
well let's just say we want to give the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.780 
well let's just say we want to give the
player<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:44.689> moo<00:01:45.689> moo<00:01:45.750> milk<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:47.220> D

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
player some moo moo milk which is one D

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.350 
player some moo moo milk which is one D
so<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.630> add<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.470> D<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> add

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so we add that in one D and we can add

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.440 
so we add that in one D and we can add
another<00:01:51.750> number<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.590> shows<00:01:53.250> how<00:01:53.759> many<00:01:54.180> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
another number which shows how many of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.660 
another number which shows how many of
the<00:01:54.570> item<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> give<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.250> let's<00:01:56.430> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the item we want to give so let's just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
the item we want to give so let's just
say<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.180> give<00:01:57.420> bashful<00:01:58.079> notes<00:01:58.469> unrealistic

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
say we give bashful notes unrealistic

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
say we give bashful notes unrealistic
but<00:01:59.310> let's<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.000> happens<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:01.460> we<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
but let's see what happens now we do a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.730 
but let's see what happens now we do a
function<00:02:04.229> called<00:02:04.469> set<00:02:04.770> slug<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.740> stops

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
function called set slug and this stops

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.130 
function called set slug and this stops
the<00:02:08.989> pokeball<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.379> reappearing<00:02:11.190> after

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the pokeball from reappearing after

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.770 
the pokeball from reappearing after
a<00:02:12.170> few<00:02:12.530> steps<00:02:12.830> or<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.520> know<00:02:13.910> after<00:02:14.210> going<00:02:14.660> off

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
a few steps or you know after going off

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.360 
a few steps or you know after going off
the<00:02:14.900> map<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.170> re-entering<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.950> stuff<00:02:16.220> at

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
the map and re-entering and stuff at

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.930 
the map and re-entering and stuff at
that<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.600> best<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.930> start<00:02:18.260> at<00:02:18.470> oxz

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
that so it's best to start at oxz

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.860 
that so it's best to start at oxz
200<00:02:20.569> or<00:02:20.780> 1200<00:02:21.440> because<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.760> other<00:02:23.090> flags

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
200 or 1200 because the other flags

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.980 
200 or 1200 because the other flags
numbers<00:02:24.350> are<00:02:24.890> taken<00:02:25.490> by<00:02:25.819> other<00:02:26.480> parts<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
numbers are taken by other parts of the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.870 
numbers are taken by other parts of the
game<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.160> be<00:02:28.250> on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.370> safe<00:02:28.550> side<00:02:28.580> I'm

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
game but just to be on the safe side I'm

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.460 
game but just to be on the safe side I'm
going<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.950> 1250<00:02:31.450> yep<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.870> we've<00:02:32.990> set

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
going to do 1250 yep now that we've set

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.080 
going to do 1250 yep now that we've set
this<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:34.190> could<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.520> different<00:02:34.850> for<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.060> of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
this it could be different for all of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.940 
this it could be different for all of
yours<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.200> use<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.770> use

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
yours you have to use it you have to use

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.370 
yours you have to use it you have to use
a<00:02:37.070> different<00:02:37.459> flag<00:02:37.940> for<00:02:38.330> every<00:02:38.630> pokeball<00:02:39.140> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
a different flag for every pokeball and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.140 
a different flag for every pokeball and
for<00:02:39.590> every<00:02:39.830> time<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.250> ever<00:02:40.280> set<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> flag<00:02:41.030> you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
for every time you ever set a flag you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.199 
for every time you ever set a flag you
have<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.420> use<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> different<00:02:41.870> number<00:02:42.050> so

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
have to use a different number so

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.640 
have to use a different number so
keeping<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.270> in<00:02:44.450> mind<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.290> we've<00:02:45.410> set

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
keeping that in mind now that we've set

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.670 
keeping that in mind now that we've set
the<00:02:45.800> flag<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.790> flag<00:02:46.970> needs<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.480> know<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:48.530> know

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the flag the flag needs to know you know

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.550 
the flag the flag needs to know you know
who<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.340> been<00:02:49.550> set<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.090> because<00:02:51.050> like<00:02:51.290> how<00:02:51.500> we

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
who it's been set to because like how we

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.320 
who it's been set to because like how we
identify<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.220> removed<00:02:52.730> sprite<00:02:53.090> sprite

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
identify that removed sprite sprite

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
identify that removed sprite sprite
event<00:02:53.840> number<00:02:54.080> for<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:55.310> flag<00:02:55.640> doesn't<00:02:56.030> know

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
event number for the flag doesn't know

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.729 
event number for the flag doesn't know
who<00:02:57.489> who<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.730> lock<00:02:58.880> onto<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.440> why<00:03:00.560> we

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
who who to lock onto so this is why we

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.330 
who who to lock onto so this is why we
change<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.220> person<00:03:01.700> ID<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> same<00:03:03.739> number

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
change the person ID to the same number

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.220 
change the person ID to the same number
as<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.610> flag<00:03:05.269> which<00:03:05.989> was<00:03:07.540> 1250<00:03:10.180> now<00:03:11.180> we<00:03:11.780> ending

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
as the flag which was 1250 now we ending

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.390 
as the flag which was 1250 now we ending
script<00:03:12.590> releasing<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.459> end<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:15.350> let's<00:03:16.190> say

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
script releasing the end and let's say

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.509 
script releasing the end and let's say
this<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.970> compile<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.250> see<00:03:19.250> what<00:03:19.400> happens

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
this and compile it and see what happens

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.289 
this and compile it and see what happens
so<00:03:21.040> I'll<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.190> save<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.610> my<00:03:22.640> desktop<00:03:22.760> as

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
so I'll just save it to my desktop as

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.530 
so I'll just save it to my desktop as
cookie<00:03:26.299> board<00:03:26.570> dot<00:03:27.170> RB<00:03:27.560> C<00:03:28.190> plus<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:29.000> standard

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
cookie board dot RB C plus the standard

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900 
cookie board dot RB C plus the standard
Rubicon<00:03:30.079> script<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.220> allows<00:03:31.489> us<00:03:31.519> to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
Rubicon script so it allows us to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.860 
Rubicon script so it allows us to
compile<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.630> now<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:35.150> we've<00:03:35.239> done<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.600> we

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
compile it now that we've done that we

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.650 
compile it now that we've done that we
can<00:03:36.459> save<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.640> ROM<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.209> we're<00:03:38.299> not<00:03:38.420> done<00:03:38.540> with

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
can save the ROM but we're not done with

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.880 
can save the ROM but we're not done with
the<00:03:38.810> ROM<00:03:38.989> yet<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:41.709> compile<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.950> script

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
the ROM yet we can compile the script

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.160 
the ROM yet we can compile the script
yep<00:03:45.920> now<00:03:46.549> we<00:03:46.820> select<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.390> ROM<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.570> think

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
yep now we select the ROM and I think

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.140 
yep now we select the ROM and I think
since<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.010> offsets<00:03:52.459> come<00:03:52.670> out<00:03:52.790> eight

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
since the offsets come out eight

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.140 
since the offsets come out eight
thousand<00:03:53.720> or<00:03:54.049> eight<00:03:54.470> eighty<00:03:55.370> thousand<00:03:56.000> I

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
thousand or eight eighty thousand I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.569 
thousand or eight eighty thousand I
think<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:56.570> proof<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.459> the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
think that's proof that this is the

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.270 
think that's proof that this is the
first<00:03:58.760> script<00:03:59.120> I'm<00:03:59.269> putting<00:03:59.570> into<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.810> game

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
first script I'm putting into the game

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.060 
first script I'm putting into the game
not<00:04:01.280> mentioning<00:04:01.610> anybody's<00:04:02.239> names<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:03.070> just

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
not mentioning anybody's names but just

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.180 
not mentioning anybody's names but just
trying<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.850> say<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.450> not<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:06.019> script<00:04:06.950> from

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
trying to say this is not a script from

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.210 
trying to say this is not a script from
anywhere<00:04:07.519> else<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.940> game<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.859> if<00:04:10.070> you're

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
anywhere else in the game so if you're

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.680 
anywhere else in the game so if you're
using<00:04:10.400> by<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.940> way<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.120> remind<00:04:11.359> if<00:04:11.510> you're

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
using by the way the remind if you're

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.870 
using by the way the remind if you're
using<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:12.019> bunch<00:04:12.260> map<00:04:12.500> one<00:04:12.799> point<00:04:13.130> nine<00:04:13.400> two

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
using a bunch map one point nine two

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.110 
using a bunch map one point nine two
which<00:04:14.239> i<00:04:14.359> think<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.750> latest<00:04:15.200> then<00:04:16.039> on<00:04:16.760> the

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
which i think is the latest then on the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.779 
which i think is the latest then on the
script<00:04:17.450> offset<00:04:17.900> place<00:04:18.530> there's<00:04:19.250> two<00:04:19.489> extra

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
script offset place there's two extra

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.870 
script offset place there's two extra
zeros<00:04:20.180> begin<00:04:20.630> not<00:04:21.289> sure<00:04:21.440> whether<00:04:21.650> they're<00:04:21.979> but

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
zeros begin not sure whether they're but

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.800 
zeros begin not sure whether they're but
they're<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.289> make<00:04:24.620> sure<00:04:24.650> you

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
they're that so make sure you

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.080 
they're that so make sure you
tastes<00:04:26.139> you<00:04:26.470> offset<00:04:26.889> after<00:04:27.310> those<00:04:27.460> two<00:04:27.730> zeros

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
tastes you offset after those two zeros

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.940 
tastes you offset after those two zeros
unless<00:04:28.510> your<00:04:28.690> offset<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.110> long<00:04:29.290> which<00:04:29.740> I've

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
unless your offset is long which I've

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.490 
unless your offset is long which I've
never<00:04:30.160> seen<00:04:30.370> before<00:04:30.490> my<00:04:30.820> life<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:32.200> make<00:04:32.470> sure

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
never seen before my life so make sure
