00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
hey everybody thank you for watching

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.409 
hey everybody thank you for watching
test-tube<00:00:01.650> plus<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.370> am<00:00:02.760> trace<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.300> this

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
test-tube plus today I am trace and this

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.200 
test-tube plus today I am trace and this
week<00:00:03.629> we<00:00:03.899> are<00:00:04.049> talking<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.770> genes<00:00:05.759> what

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
week we are talking about genes what

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.179 
week we are talking about genes what
they<00:00:06.330> can<00:00:06.480> do<00:00:06.660> what<00:00:06.899> they<00:00:06.960> can't<00:00:07.350> do<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.620> how

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
they can do what they can't do and how

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.280 
they can do what they can't do and how
to<00:00:08.250> mess<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:08.970> them<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.780> case<00:00:09.990> you've<00:00:10.139> never

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
to mess with them in case you've never

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.049 
to mess with them in case you've never
watched<00:00:10.530> test-tube<00:00:11.010> plus<00:00:11.250> before<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
watched test-tube plus before this is a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.580 
watched test-tube plus before this is a
show<00:00:12.330> where<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.599> spend<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:12.960> entire<00:00:13.080> week

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
show where we spend an entire week

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
show where we spend an entire week
breaking<00:00:14.070> down<00:00:14.219> big<00:00:14.580> science<00:00:14.969> topics<00:00:15.389> it's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
breaking down big science topics it's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.900 
breaking down big science topics it's
sort<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> podcast<00:00:16.410> style<00:00:17.100> show<00:00:17.430> so

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
sort of like a podcast style show so

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.820 
sort of like a podcast style show so
feel<00:00:18.119> free<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.330> slap<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:18.960> headphones<00:00:19.320> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
feel free to slap on some headphones and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.170 
feel free to slap on some headphones and
put<00:00:20.279> me<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.670> background<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.150> not

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
put me on in the background I'm not

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.790 
put me on in the background I'm not
going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.539> offended<00:00:21.779> I've<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.470> my<00:00:22.590> notes

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
going to be offended I've got my notes

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
going to be offended I've got my notes
here<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.039> my<00:00:23.250> computer<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:24.060> gonna<00:00:24.240> pull<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
here on my computer and I'm gonna pull a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
here on my computer and I'm gonna pull a
lot<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.740> brain<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.220> well<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
lot of this out of my brain as well so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.540 
lot of this out of my brain as well so
should<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:27.060> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.330> fun<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.859> present<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
should be kind of fun so the present of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.250 
should be kind of fun so the present of
genes<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.920> sort<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.090> future<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> mean

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
genes is sort of like the future I mean

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
genes is sort of like the future I mean
when<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.520> flying<00:00:35.969> cars<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
when you think about flying cars and you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
when you think about flying cars and you
think<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.260> rockets<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> space<00:00:38.309> travel<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
think about rockets and space travel you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
think about rockets and space travel you
also<00:00:39.450> probably<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.739> genetic

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
also probably think about genetic

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
also probably think about genetic
modification<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.270> genetic<00:00:42.600> engineering

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
modification and genetic engineering

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.470 
modification and genetic engineering
it's<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.219> connected<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.820> science<00:00:45.300> fiction

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it's so connected with science fiction

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810 
it's so connected with science fiction
and<00:00:45.780> genetic<00:00:46.350> modification<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and genetic modification it's here the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.690 
and genetic modification it's here the
future<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:49.039> GMOs<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.370> genetically

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
future is now GMOs or genetically

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
future is now GMOs or genetically
modified<00:00:50.960> organisms<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.160> everywhere

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
modified organisms are everywhere

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
modified organisms are everywhere
they're<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.670> every<00:00:54.149> grocery<00:00:54.510> store<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:55.079> over

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
they're in every grocery store all over

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
they're in every grocery store all over
the<00:00:56.250> world<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.899> we're<00:00:58.050> done

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the world there are some that we're done

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.630 
the world there are some that we're done
through<00:00:58.469> traditional<00:00:59.010> breeding<00:00:59.430> techniques

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
through traditional breeding techniques

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
through traditional breeding techniques
and<00:01:00.120> those<00:01:00.480> aren't<00:01:00.690> technically<00:01:01.440> considered

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and those aren't technically considered

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
and those aren't technically considered
genetically<00:01:02.370> modified<00:01:02.760> organisms<00:01:03.420> they're

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
genetically modified organisms they're

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
genetically modified organisms they're
just<00:01:03.899> breeding<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> hybrid

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
just breeding so it's like a hybrid

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.539 
just breeding so it's like a hybrid
organism<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.750> corn<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.530> example<00:01:07.619> has

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
organism but corn for example has

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.780 
organism but corn for example has
specifically<00:01:09.240> been<00:01:09.570> bred<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.549> modified<00:01:11.549> at

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
specifically been bred and modified at

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.410 
specifically been bred and modified at
the<00:01:12.030> genetic<00:01:12.630> level<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:14.000> company<00:01:15.000> named<00:01:15.270> on

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the genetic level a company named on

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140 
the genetic level a company named on
Santo<00:01:15.840> took<00:01:16.320> corn<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.580> took<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
Santo took corn and they took the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
Santo took corn and they took the
bacteria<00:01:18.930> bacillus<00:01:19.880> thuringiensis<00:01:21.530> C's<00:01:22.530> they

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
bacteria bacillus thuringiensis C's they

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
bacteria bacillus thuringiensis C's they
just<00:01:23.250> called<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> BT<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:23.970> their<00:01:24.119> research

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
just called it BT and their research

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.320 
just called it BT and their research
nailed<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.890> took<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.340> genes<00:01:26.670> from<00:01:27.030> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
nailed it they took the genes from that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
nailed it they took the genes from that
bacteria<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.500> put<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.520> corn

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bacteria and they put it into the corn

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.450 
bacteria and they put it into the corn
and<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.509> bacteria<00:01:30.720> lived<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.860> fungus<00:01:32.280> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and that bacteria lived in a fungus in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
and that bacteria lived in a fungus in
the<00:01:32.670> corn<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.840> brought

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the corn so it actually brought

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.429 
the corn so it actually brought
properties<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> corn<00:01:36.180> already<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
properties to the corn already this is

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
properties to the corn already this is
just<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.920> direct<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.880> company<00:01:39.240> felt

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
just a more direct way the company felt

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.960 
just a more direct way the company felt
and<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.170> doing<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.979> bacteria<00:01:41.820> actually

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and in doing so that bacteria actually

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
and in doing so that bacteria actually
naturally<00:01:42.840> destroys<00:01:43.259> insects<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.340> now<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
naturally destroys insects so now that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.600 
naturally destroys insects so now that
corn<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.750> fight<00:01:46.020> those<00:01:46.229> insects<00:01:46.740> off<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.340> if

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
corn can fight those insects off or if

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
corn can fight those insects off or if
that<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> idea<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.960> essentially<00:01:49.320> they

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that was the idea so essentially they

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.310 
that was the idea so essentially they
genetically<00:01:50.040> modified<00:01:50.490> corn<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
genetically modified corn to be more of

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
or something but it's still a thing and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.440

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it's all over the world and it has

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.410 
it's all over the world and it has
changed<00:02:07.110> how<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:08.009> our<00:02:08.220> food<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:09.330> are

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
changed how we get our food there are

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.029 
changed how we get our food there are
also<00:02:09.539> things<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.349> little<00:02:10.560> more<00:02:10.800> sexy

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
also things that are a little more sexy

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
also things that are a little more sexy
like<00:02:11.370> glowing<00:02:11.819> plants<00:02:12.150> where<00:02:12.540> they've

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
like glowing plants where they've

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
like glowing plants where they've
spliced<00:02:13.140> phosphor

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
spliced phosphor

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.820 
spliced phosphor
into<00:02:14.700> trees<00:02:15.150> or<00:02:15.600> smaller<00:02:16.020> plants<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
into trees or smaller plants so that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.100 
into trees or smaller plants so that
they<00:02:17.070> glow<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.790> night<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:18.570> even<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.930> done

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
they glow at night they even have done

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
they glow at night they even have done
this<00:02:19.290> not<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.740> with<00:02:19.890> plants<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.520> with<00:02:20.820> cats

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
this not just with plants but with cats

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.170 
this not just with plants but with cats
I<00:02:22.020> know<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.800> weird<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.370> they<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:24.000> made

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
I know it's weird but they have made

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.080 
I know it's weird but they have made
glowing<00:02:24.720> cats<00:02:25.380> they've<00:02:26.100> also<00:02:26.280> made<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.970> this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
glowing cats they've also made and this

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.700 
glowing cats they've also made and this
one<00:02:27.330> really<00:02:27.630> creeps<00:02:28.140> me<00:02:28.380> out

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
one really creeps me out

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.640 
one really creeps me out
goats<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.850> produce<00:02:30.240> spider<00:02:30.630> silk<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.350> their

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
goats that produce spider silk in their

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.300 
goats that produce spider silk in their
milk

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
milk

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.800 
milk
they<00:02:32.760> added<00:02:33.000> spider<00:02:33.750> genes<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:35.250> goat<00:02:35.550> DNA<00:02:36.150> so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
they added spider genes to goat DNA so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.690 
they added spider genes to goat DNA so
when<00:02:36.960> goats<00:02:37.140> produce<00:02:37.530> milk<00:02:37.830> they're<00:02:38.520> also

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
when goats produce milk they're also

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.510 
when goats produce milk they're also
producing<00:02:39.090> spider<00:02:39.750> silk<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:41.070> reason<00:02:41.400> they're

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
producing spider silk the reason they're

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.800 
producing spider silk the reason they're
doing<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.910> because<00:02:42.090> spider<00:02:42.450> silk<00:02:42.690> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
doing that is because spider silk is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.360 
doing that is because spider silk is
highly<00:02:43.110> valued<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.650> very<00:02:43.830> difficult<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
highly valued and very difficult to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.520 
highly valued and very difficult to
harvest<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:45.000> extremely<00:02:45.660> strong<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.260> now

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
harvest it's extremely strong so now

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.110 
harvest it's extremely strong so now
they<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> from<00:02:47.430> something<00:02:48.000> that

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
they can get it from something that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.030 
they can get it from something that
produces<00:02:48.300> milk<00:02:48.750> all<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.930> time<00:02:49.200> they<00:02:49.890> also

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
produces milk all the time they also

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.860 
produces milk all the time they also
created<00:02:50.460> trees<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.030> grow<00:02:51.180> faster<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
created trees that grow faster for the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.630 
created trees that grow faster for the
lumber<00:02:52.170> industry<00:02:52.320> plants<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.130> absorb<00:02:53.490> more

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
lumber industry plants that absorb more

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.400 
lumber industry plants that absorb more
carbon<00:02:53.820> dioxide<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.690> they<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:54.930> absorb<00:02:55.110> more

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
carbon dioxide so they can absorb more

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.590 
carbon dioxide so they can absorb more
pollution<00:02:55.770> be<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> carbon<00:02:56.610> sink<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.270> created

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
pollution be a carbon sink they created

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.980 
pollution be a carbon sink they created
cows<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.560> fart<00:02:59.010> less<00:02:59.370> methane<00:02:59.760> 25<00:03:00.570> percent

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
cows that fart less methane 25 percent

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.110 
cows that fart less methane 25 percent
less<00:03:01.170> that's<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.650> lot<00:03:01.890> less<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.550> methane

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
less that's a lot less because methane

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.080 
less that's a lot less because methane
is<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> terrible<00:03:03.870> greenhouse<00:03:04.320> gas<00:03:04.700> all<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
is a terrible greenhouse gas all of this

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.530 
is a terrible greenhouse gas all of this
is<00:03:06.300> done<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:07.080> genetic<00:03:07.560> modification

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
is done with genetic modification

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.600 
is done with genetic modification
there's<00:03:09.540> also<00:03:09.750> things<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.410> gene<00:03:10.950> therapy

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
there's also things like gene therapy

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.790 
there's also things like gene therapy
gene<00:03:12.270> therapy<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.720> experimental<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.560> only

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
gene therapy is experimental it's only

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.360 
gene therapy is experimental it's only
really<00:03:14.070> for<00:03:14.100> dire<00:03:14.610> non<00:03:15.510> curable<00:03:16.370> incurable

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
really for dire non curable incurable

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.350 
really for dire non curable incurable
diseases<00:03:18.200> essentially<00:03:19.910> these<00:03:20.910> are<00:03:21.090> for

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
diseases essentially these are for

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780 
diseases essentially these are for
genetic<00:03:21.989> problems<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.100> have<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> gene

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
genetic problems so if you have a gene

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.520 
genetic problems so if you have a gene
that's<00:03:23.820> malfunctioning<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:25.050> that's<00:03:25.230> causing

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that's malfunctioning and that's causing

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.280 
that's malfunctioning and that's causing
a<00:03:25.800> disease<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.489> your<00:03:26.519> body<00:03:26.730> they<00:03:27.630> take<00:03:28.050> that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
a disease in your body they take that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.229 
a disease in your body they take that
gene<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.650> they<00:03:29.160> knock<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.760> out<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> way

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
gene and they knock it out of the way

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.440 
gene and they knock it out of the way
and<00:03:30.510> put<00:03:30.570> in<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.230> functioning<00:03:31.800> gene<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:33.090> doesn't

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and put in a functioning gene it doesn't

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.290 
and put in a functioning gene it doesn't
always<00:03:33.570> work<00:03:33.690> though<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:35.070> really<00:03:35.519> only<00:03:35.880> is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
always work though and it really only is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.240 
always work though and it really only is
beneficial<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:37.019> something<00:03:37.350> like<00:03:37.530> anemia<00:03:38.190> or

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
beneficial for something like anemia or

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
things ranging from environmental causes

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.130 
things ranging from environmental causes
to<00:03:46.709> genetic<00:03:47.100> causes<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.880> asthma<00:03:48.150> or<00:03:48.900> cancer

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
to genetic causes like asthma or cancer

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.440 
to genetic causes like asthma or cancer
so<00:03:49.800> most<00:03:50.040> genetic<00:03:50.400> modification<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.300> be

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
so most genetic modification can be

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.910 
so most genetic modification can be
pretty<00:03:51.660> normal<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.290> actually<00:03:52.410> fairly

putting<00:05:42.810> in<00:05:43.080> hopefully<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.620> new<00:05:43.860> gene<00:05:44.130> doesn't

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
putting in hopefully a new gene doesn't

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.820 
putting in hopefully a new gene doesn't
always<00:05:44.940> work<00:05:45.210> though<00:05:45.450> now<00:05:46.200> if<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.440> did<00:05:46.650> this

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
always work though now if you did this

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.110 
always work though now if you did this
on<00:05:47.340> a<00:05:47.400> tiny<00:05:48.240> level<00:05:48.570> with<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:48.930> fertilized<00:05:49.560> egg

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
on a tiny level with a fertilized egg

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.540 
on a tiny level with a fertilized egg
now<00:05:51.120> you've<00:05:51.420> created<00:05:51.750> an<00:05:52.140> altered<00:05:52.710> genetic

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
now you've created an altered genetic

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.270 
now you've created an altered genetic
being<00:05:53.910> so<00:05:54.840> when<00:05:55.200> it<00:05:55.290> came<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.680> producing<00:05:56.130> that

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
being so when it came to producing that

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.600 
being so when it came to producing that
GMO<00:05:56.790> corn<00:05:57.090> this<00:05:57.720> is<00:05:57.900> likely<00:05:58.200> how<00:05:58.680> Monsanto<00:05:59.340> did

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
GMO corn this is likely how Monsanto did

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.730 
GMO corn this is likely how Monsanto did
that<00:05:59.790> there's<00:06:00.690> actually<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.080> newer<00:06:01.410> method

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
that there's actually a newer method

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.430 
that there's actually a newer method
that's<00:06:02.400> even<00:06:02.850> more<00:06:03.210> efficient<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:04.050> do<00:06:04.260> this

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
that's even more efficient to do this

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.320 
that's even more efficient to do this
that's<00:06:04.710> got<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:04.920> lot<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:05.370> scientists<00:06:05.880> super

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
that's got a lot of scientists super

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.620 
that's got a lot of scientists super
excited<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:06.990> it's<00:06:07.380> called<00:06:07.560> CRISPR<00:06:08.420> CRISPR<00:06:09.420> is

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
excited and it's called CRISPR CRISPR is

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.800 
excited and it's called CRISPR CRISPR is
so<00:06:10.170> easy<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.920> do<00:06:11.310> that<00:06:11.720> scientists<00:06:12.720> are

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
so easy to do that scientists are

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.710 
so easy to do that scientists are
actually<00:06:13.230> worried<00:06:13.730> essentially<00:06:14.730> you<00:06:15.030> cut<00:06:15.480> the

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
actually worried essentially you cut the

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.980 
actually worried essentially you cut the
DNA<00:06:16.200> then<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:17.010> add<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.610> new<00:06:17.910> piece<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.120> RNA<00:06:18.510> and

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
DNA then you add a new piece of RNA and

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.710 
DNA then you add a new piece of RNA and
the<00:06:19.320> DNA<00:06:19.770> strand<00:06:20.160> heals<00:06:20.700> itself<00:06:21.120> when<00:06:21.630> it

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
the DNA strand heals itself when it

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.890 
the DNA strand heals itself when it
heals<00:06:21.990> itself<00:06:22.550> boom<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:24.330> have<00:06:24.450> altered<00:06:24.750> that

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
heals itself boom you have altered that

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.050 
heals itself boom you have altered that
organism<00:06:25.410> I<00:06:25.590> know<00:06:25.920> that<00:06:26.190> sounds<00:06:26.520> simple<00:06:26.760> it

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
organism I know that sounds simple it

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.030 
organism I know that sounds simple it
actually<00:06:27.540> is<00:06:27.690> I<00:06:27.960> know<00:06:28.020> there's<00:06:28.290> more<00:06:28.590> science

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
actually is I know there's more science

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.830 
actually is I know there's more science
to<00:06:29.220> that<00:06:29.400> and<00:06:29.640> it's<00:06:29.790> way<00:06:29.970> more<00:06:30.000> in-depth<00:06:30.570> but

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
to that and it's way more in-depth but

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.310 
to that and it's way more in-depth but
it's<00:06:31.380> beyond<00:06:32.100> my<00:06:32.520> understanding<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:33.480> do<00:06:33.690> but

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
it's beyond my understanding to do but

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.500 
it's beyond my understanding to do but
from<00:06:34.620> a<00:06:34.800> molecular<00:06:35.280> biological<00:06:35.760> perspective

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
from a molecular biological perspective

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.190 
from a molecular biological perspective
those<00:06:37.380> scientists<00:06:37.920> it's<00:06:38.790> simple<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:39.930> that's

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
those scientists it's simple and that's

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.279 
those scientists it's simple and that's
scaring<00:06:40.500> people

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
scaring people

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.619 
scaring people
because<00:06:41.559> scientists<00:06:42.159> in<00:06:42.249> China<00:06:42.460> used<00:06:43.180> CRISPR

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
because scientists in China used CRISPR

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.119 
because scientists in China used CRISPR
to<00:06:44.319> modify<00:06:45.240> non-viable<00:06:46.240> human<00:06:46.659> embryos<00:06:47.129> they

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
to modify non-viable human embryos they

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.969 
to modify non-viable human embryos they
edited<00:06:48.669> humans<00:06:49.180> using<00:06:49.930> this<00:06:50.199> technique<00:06:50.680> and

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
edited humans using this technique and

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.279 
edited humans using this technique and
they<00:06:51.520> showed<00:06:51.819> that<00:06:51.849> human<00:06:52.539> DNA<00:06:52.960> can<00:06:53.259> be

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
they showed that human DNA can be

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.609 
they showed that human DNA can be
genetically<00:06:54.039> modified<00:06:54.550> with<00:06:55.330> this<00:06:55.619> that's

00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:56.619 
genetically modified with this that's

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:59.010 
genetically modified with this that's
some<00:06:56.830> scary<00:06:56.979> stuff<00:06:57.520> I<00:06:57.849> mean<00:06:58.449> we're<00:06:58.839> talking

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
some scary stuff I mean we're talking

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.279 
some scary stuff I mean we're talking
what<00:06:59.889> could<00:07:00.099> happen<00:07:00.460> if<00:07:00.639> people<00:07:00.669> start

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
what could happen if people start

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.649 
what could happen if people start
modifying<00:07:02.289> humans<00:07:03.119> we're<00:07:04.119> not<00:07:04.210> gonna<00:07:04.300> get<00:07:04.509> too

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:04.659 
modifying humans we're not gonna get too

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.480 
modifying humans we're not gonna get too
much<00:07:04.809> into<00:07:05.050> that<00:07:05.169> today<00:07:05.559> you're<00:07:06.219> gonna<00:07:06.309> have
