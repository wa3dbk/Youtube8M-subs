 we are in a very important video 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.420
 because you take 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.760
 through our big shot we are just 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.610
 to see if the small things are 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.830
 also very cool stuff and this is coming 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.300
 first gameplay and good as put here 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.180

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.100
 I do not know what it accomplishes various is with a gif 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.100
 and how can you see there when it hits 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.670
 loose ink and it looks amazing I do not 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670
 vehement 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.879
 How cool and good I notice that I do not know if it 's 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.220
 the faucet looks a little the bar below 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.060
 if you notice then how it looks earlier if 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.950
 to a squid spoiler he 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.290
 and the egg that was down or that no longer 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.900
 it is rarely seen is the bottom of the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.950
 inventory in the kit but not leaving 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.720
 side also wants to tell you something 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.150

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.710
 they have a lot of this the servei wanted 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.930
 make a video of this but not all of 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.160
 but it will be time once people 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.340
 please I said it already I said it I do not know 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.460
 we have told them on twitter them cure 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.820
 I do not know how it is without exaggerating about 30 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.560
 times that midweek I will not be 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.140
 I can not on the server because I have 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.300
 classes and so on and I'll barely have time 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.680
 of half-eaten came I'm flying by 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.210
 everywhere now on weekdays no 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.220
 game I always know that game end of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.510
 week and another thing that asks me today 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.490
 we're going to do is I saw you but you're 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.720
 doing so I did not greet this and now 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.670
 I hate you and death and like that and to begin with 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.259
 people who are already in the channel already know or 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.440
 Rollo thing I or joke I 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.759
 Parkour 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.130
 I do not do to happen in the lobby 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.409
 never or always when he always entered 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 I say hi greetings 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.229
 when running around around the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 lobby and also this does more than anything 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.170
 I wanted to clarify that because if one has 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.600
 who was offended because I too never 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.429
 Fake private and can send 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.390
 send private because I do not know why 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.129
 jiang motive rather I'll william blog 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.170
 allows me to stay working like jan 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.690
 because we're in this right now but this one 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.420
 I will not know why the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.980
 private but hey if they were all 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.709
 servers I do not know I think it's a pocket thing 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.959
 mine I do not know but I do not send private the 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.780
 false sends private what if it can not 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.700
 to do is to write in the chat because 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.549
 they have my password then if not 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.799
 write in the public chat is not me 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.810
 I repeat it's not me I put it like that with 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.269
 little stars with little apples and little balls 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.069
 I know that I really put up a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.200
 image on twitter with a text that said 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.599
 what I already said a thousand times that if not 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.049
 talk is not me I do not send private me 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.120
 I do not parkour I greet subs I enter 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.900
 games and most important of all I 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.250
 notice on twitter and also 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.530
 the weekends are the most 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.120
 important means this because I 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.099
 they are according to you and we enter while 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.140
 that comes in or yesterday I was in the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.049
 cinema dictates to them the cinema and others and they are 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.090
 almost what do you do you miss the estimate 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.069
 because you were in the earthquake that I am in 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.510
 the cinema like they do on the server and then 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.150
 they tell me come in but it's just that I'm 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.400
 busy sometimes and I can not is when I 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.540
 I enter the weekend and then 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.340
 they know or the weekend always 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.769
 we played small but nothing else light 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.970
 what is well prayed and sometimes the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.319
 Sundays because it's always Friday and 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.959
 Saturday and he wants to say this because if the 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.420
 false, I do not know what he was doing 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.159
 these nine weird things and then I ask them 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.650
 apologies because I can not control 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.180
 is there a lot much false not only of 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.609
 me of all the youtubers there are always 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.800
 false and did not want to make a 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.080
 big confusion about that why 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.150
 and there are many who already know and 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.010
 I thank those who already know what wave 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.410
 those who already know that I am not me could 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.790
 I ask you please in that video les les 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.950
 I pray that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.870
 I do not know let's tell them in the chat that 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.150
 you hear is not monster do not do it 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.099
 case at least that I nice has 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.689
 irrigated the things he said in the chat 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.640
 that not what impostors can not 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.530
 talk about public chat I say private 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.969
 but it's a private now because it's not 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.670
 I know there are people who do not understand anything 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.519
 Sometimes a private is a thing that says 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.049
 a little arrow that says the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.850
 message that is a private that I do not 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.710
 send the ones that send all the videos 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.910
 as spam that we are private I can not 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.800
 send them and I do not send private do not 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.539
 like private send equipment 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.610
 who sent private or I say everything in 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.580
 public in the chat then so the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.770
 things folks let's ask them a 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.330
 apologize for the impostor the servel this 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.470
 I'm enjoying it because there are between subs 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.969
 and I spend the weekend when 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.429
 I enter 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.959

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:47.610
 good people that is all for this video 

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:51.389

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.069

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:14.069

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.819

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.330
 please do not bank the boosters 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.920
 If they are offended, obviously, it's not me. 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:15.280
 tantito logic beloved offended 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.250
 also that in the private one it puts them in 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.220
 point things like that I 'm not serious as 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.840
 it may be that I am offended by that 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.150
 same the parkour there is a do but 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.490
 so if it was like every day 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.180
 since I put the green one came and 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.190
 I read like some diaries with about 20 to 50 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.900
 tweets with even photos that say 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.210
 monsters are you monsters are you 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.280

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.750
 Well, I'm not really going 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.890
 establishing this in all the videos 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.840
 from now on so it looks good 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.690
 clear because I do not know sometimes not the 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.370
 they listen they do not understand 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.470
 those who do understand and I ask them to please 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.120
 I will give you a big hug if you help me in 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.460
 I thank them very much and they help me and I 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.600
 they tell everyone else that is not every 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.980
 Once you ask me if they can they 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.040
 can clarify why then nothing 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.720
 confusions and this and it helps me a lot 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.070
 because good as there are enough 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.510
 they ask is not to respond to 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.370
 all that is not me that is not me that 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.889
