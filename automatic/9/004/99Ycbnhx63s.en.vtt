this<00:00:13.139> set<00:00:13.380> up<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.769> pretty<00:00:14.250> easy<00:00:14.540> but<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.599> just

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this set up it's pretty easy but I just

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.240 
this set up it's pretty easy but I just
don't<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> Peacekeeper<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.070> just

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
don't like the Peacekeeper it just

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880 
don't like the Peacekeeper it just
doesn't<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> lot<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.050> damage<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.740> don't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.439 
doesn't do a lot of damage I don't
really<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.550> reason<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:21.090> mean

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
really like it for that reason I mean

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
really like it for that reason I mean
I'm<00:00:21.570> more<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> guy<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.260> uses<00:00:22.439> slow<00:00:22.890> firing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
I'm more of a guy that uses slow firing

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.750 
I'm more of a guy that uses slow firing
weapons<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.820> high<00:00:24.000> damage<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> scar-h

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
weapons with high damage like the scar-h

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.099 
weapons with high damage like the scar-h
then<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.000> slow<00:00:27.210> firing<00:00:27.599> weapon<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
then a slow firing weapon like the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.439 
then a slow firing weapon like the
Peacekeeper<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.160> recoil<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.330> also

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
Peacekeeper with little recoil but also

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.510 
Peacekeeper with little recoil but also
little<00:00:30.779> damage<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.349> kind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> m27

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
little damage it's kind of like the m27

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.630 
little damage it's kind of like the m27
but<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:33.570> worse<00:00:34.130> that's<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.250> how<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
but then worse that's just how it is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
but then worse that's just how it is
this<00:00:35.880> gun<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.090> pretty<00:00:36.450> much<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> m27<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.530> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this gun is pretty much the m27 but it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
this gun is pretty much the m27 but it's
worse<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.070> doesn't<00:00:38.309> look<00:00:38.370> cooler<00:00:38.610> though<00:00:38.910> or

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
worse it doesn't look cooler though or

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.119 
worse it doesn't look cooler though or
at<00:00:39.780> least<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> looks<00:00:40.860> cool<00:00:41.070> i

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
at least I think that it looks cool i

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.150 
at least I think that it looks cool i
really<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> white<00:00:42.000> camo<00:00:42.360> pretty<00:00:42.780> much

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
really like the white camo pretty much

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
really like the white camo pretty much
because<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.550> something<00:00:45.059> different<00:00:45.440> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
because it's something different it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.729 
because it's something different it's
something<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.399> very<00:00:47.879> often

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
something you don't see very very often

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
something you don't see very very often
hopefully<00:00:49.739> ghost<00:00:50.039> will<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.640> many<00:00:51.539> more

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
hopefully ghost will have many more

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.090 
of a lot mistaken or on the xbox i don't
even<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.479> works<00:01:24.920> maybe<00:01:25.920> i<00:01:26.009> could

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
even know how that works maybe i could

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.670 
even know how that works maybe i could
just<00:01:26.280> connect<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.840> origin<00:01:28.200> account<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
xbox and then downloaded like thats

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
xbox and then downloaded like thats
that'd<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:30.840> better<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.340> because

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that'd be a lot better actually because

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.640 
that'd be a lot better actually because
i'm<00:01:32.549> far<00:01:32.880> better<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> xbox<00:01:33.930> than<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.229> am<00:01:34.380> on

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
like a casual battlefield player I don't

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
like a casual battlefield player I don't
really<00:01:48.780> play<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> often<00:01:49.640> but<00:01:50.640> when<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.820> do

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
really play that often but when I do

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.859 
really play that often but when I do
it's<00:01:51.329> usually<00:01:51.950> pretty<00:01:52.950> fun<00:01:53.450> Cole<00:01:54.450> duty<00:01:54.750> can

get frustrating I really have that with
benefield<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> guess<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:57.630> mainly<00:01:58.110> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
benefield but I guess that's mainly just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
benefield but I guess that's mainly just
because<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.610> like<00:02:00.180> I'm
