got to see a nice patch that last year
than<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> thought<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> might<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:59.010> an

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
than I thought it might be an

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.670 
than I thought it might be an
interesting<00:00:59.520> companion<00:01:00.379> lucky<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.500> didn't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
interesting companion lucky I didn't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
interesting companion lucky I didn't
think<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.980> hell<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.640> came<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.359> arrived<00:01:03.660> on

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
think that hell it came it arrived on

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.450 
think that hell it came it arrived on
its<00:01:04.019> own<00:01:04.170> into<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.559> polyculture<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.309> can

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
its own into this polyculture you can

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.679 
its own into this polyculture you can
see<00:01:05.700> where<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.830> started<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> blend<00:01:09.119> itself<00:01:09.479> in

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
see where it started to blend itself in

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.910 
see where it started to blend itself in
with<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.280> Egyptian<00:01:11.280> onions<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.939> um<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
with the Egyptian onions there um and it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.929 
with the Egyptian onions there um and it
arrived<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> thought<00:01:14.580> well<00:01:14.729> that's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
arrived and I thought well that's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.190 
arrived and I thought well that's
interesting<00:01:15.180> maybe<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.720> should<00:01:15.900> give<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
interesting maybe we should give that a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.609 
interesting maybe we should give that a
go<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.270> spring<00:01:18.630> i<00:01:18.750> weeded<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.170> some<00:01:19.470> other

I<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.790> been<00:02:13.030> over<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.900> layered<00:02:14.790> where<00:02:15.790> you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
I just been over and layered where you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.820 
I just been over and layered where you
simply<00:02:16.090> take<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> jostle<00:02:17.349> barrier<00:02:17.590> do

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
simply take with the jostle barrier do

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.729 
simply take with the jostle barrier do
spirit<00:02:18.160> contour<00:02:18.610> some<00:02:18.760> other<00:02:18.910> things<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.590> can

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
spirit contour some other things you can

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.290 
spirit contour some other things you can
play<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.280> branch<00:02:21.610> right<00:02:21.760> down<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.270> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
play that branch right down on the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.080 
play that branch right down on the
ground<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.069> case<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:26.230> coming<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:27.090> over

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
ground in this case it's coming out over

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.589 
ground in this case it's coming out over
here<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:30.040> put<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.550> stress<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.450> branch<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.640> I

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
here and I put a stress the branch and I

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.660 
here and I put a stress the branch and I
put<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> piece<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> wood<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> rock<00:02:36.190> over<00:02:36.220> to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
put a piece of wood and a rock over to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.830 
put a piece of wood and a rock over to
hold<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.030> down<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:38.319> incredibly<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.970> will

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
hold it down and incredibly this will

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.680 
hold it down and incredibly this will
root<00:02:41.459> underneath<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.640> log<00:02:42.940> over<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.420> course

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
root underneath this log over the course

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.610 
root underneath this log over the course
of<00:02:44.340> 2010<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.819> year<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.390> then<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> spring

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
of 2010 this year and then in the spring

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.550 
of 2010 this year and then in the spring
can<00:02:48.190> cut<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.489> over<00:02:48.910> here<00:02:49.299> we'll<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.380> new

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
can cut it over here we'll have a new

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.740 
can cut it over here we'll have a new
plant<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.060> really<00:02:52.209> easy<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> propagate

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
plant so it's really easy to propagate

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.350 
plant so it's really easy to propagate
in<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.290> way<00:02:53.440> I'm<00:02:53.590> propagating<00:02:54.400> while

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
in that way I'm propagating while

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.320 
in that way I'm propagating while
pruning<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.489> making<00:02:57.489> things<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.910> way<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.060> want

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
pruning and making things the way I want

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.789 
pruning and making things the way I want
them<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.840> from<00:02:59.769> my<00:02:59.890> polyculture<00:03:01.799> and

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
them to be from my polyculture and

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.370 
them to be from my polyculture and
that's<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.730> about<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:05.080> about<00:03:07.049> 15<00:03:08.049> or<00:03:08.230> 20

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
that's it in about in about 15 or 20

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.350 
that's it in about in about 15 or 20
minutes<00:03:08.560> I've<00:03:08.980> created<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.489> new<00:03:09.910> polyculture

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
minutes I've created a new polyculture

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.339 
minutes I've created a new polyculture
arrived<00:03:10.780> listen<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.360> garden<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.569> doesn't

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
arrived listen to the garden and doesn't

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.720 
arrived listen to the garden and doesn't
have<00:03:14.440> worked<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.860> polyculture<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.610> it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
have worked on a polyculture that it

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.020 
have worked on a polyculture that it
suggested<00:03:17.040> done<00:03:18.040> some<00:03:18.250> pruning<00:03:18.549> done<00:03:18.820> some

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
suggested done some pruning done some

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.090 
suggested done some pruning done some
transplanting<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.500> basically<00:03:20.829> it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
transplanting and that's basically it

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.390 
transplanting and that's basically it
between<00:03:21.579> now<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.000> harvest<00:03:22.359> time<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:24.280> this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
between now and harvest time for this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.940 
between now and harvest time for this
polyculture<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.450> that's<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.170> very<00:03:26.440> low

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
polyculture so that's a very low

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.640 
polyculture so that's a very low
maintenance<00:03:27.250> system<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.420> I'll<00:03:28.870> keep<00:03:29.109> tabs<00:03:29.410> on

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
maintenance system and I'll keep tabs on

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.549 
maintenance system and I'll keep tabs on
how<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:30.010> goes<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.340> here
