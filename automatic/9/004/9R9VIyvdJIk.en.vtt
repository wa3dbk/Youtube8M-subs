00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
when it goes live but today's episode is

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.130 
when it goes live but today's episode is
going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.670> dealing<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.570> enemy

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
going to be about dealing with enemy

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.950 
going to be about dealing with enemy
vehicles<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.790> Call<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> Duty<00:00:39.360> obviously

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
vehicles and in Call of Duty obviously

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
vehicles and in Call of Duty obviously
there's<00:00:40.140> no<00:00:40.399> one<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.730> equivalent<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there's no one to one equivalent of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630 
there's no one to one equivalent of
enemy<00:00:43.260> vehicles<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> think<00:00:44.219> most<00:00:44.399> cod

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
enemy vehicles but I think most cod

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.470 
enemy vehicles but I think most cod
players<00:00:44.940> myself<00:00:45.539> included<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
players myself included we think of

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.209 
players myself included we think of
vehicles<00:00:48.480> similar<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.200> kill<00:00:49.500> streaks<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.010> call

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
vehicles similar to kill streaks in call

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.270 
vehicles similar to kill streaks in call
of<00:00:50.250> duty<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.930> they're<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:53.039> like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
of duty so but they're not really like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
of duty so but they're not really like
kill<00:00:53.550> streaks<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.690> unlimited<00:00:54.840> time<00:00:55.739> or

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
kill streaks they have unlimited time or

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.360 
kill streaks they have unlimited time or
fuel<00:00:56.370> basically<00:00:57.000> unlimited<00:00:57.719> ammo<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> they

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
fuel basically unlimited ammo and they

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
fuel basically unlimited ammo and they
can<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.550> repaired<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.390> engineers<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.079> they

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can be repaired with engineers so they

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.410 
can be repaired with engineers so they
they<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:02.000> very<00:01:03.000> high<00:01:03.120> health<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:05.420> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
they can have very high health and so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
they can have very high health and so
how<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.049> deal<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.590> kill<00:01:08.250> streaks<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
how do we deal with kill streaks and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.800 
how do we deal with kill streaks and
call<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> duty<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:10.610> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.700> sad<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.360> run

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
call of duty it's kind of sad but we run

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.670 
call of duty it's kind of sad but we run
we<00:01:13.049> hide<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:14.490> cower<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.170> cry<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.240 
claymore and they go away when you die
the<00:02:10.440> 80<00:02:10.649> mines<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.160> stay<00:02:11.400> there

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the 80 mines will stay there

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.370 
the 80 mines will stay there
so<00:02:12.490> what<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.570> when<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> spawn<00:02:14.140> in

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
so what I like to do is when I spawn in

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.700 
so what I like to do is when I spawn in
at<00:02:14.730> any<00:02:15.730> bomb<00:02:16.420> site<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.140> flick<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> first

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
at any bomb site for the flick the first

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.980 
at any bomb site for the flick the first
time<00:02:17.950> I'll<00:02:18.400> switch<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.090> my<00:02:19.210> engineer<00:02:19.780> class

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
time I'll switch to my engineer class

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.590 
time I'll switch to my engineer class
and<00:02:20.230> I'll<00:02:20.290> drop<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.710> t-<00:02:21.070> all<00:02:21.400> around<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.330> roads

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
and I'll drop a t- all around the roads

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.980 
and I'll drop a t- all around the roads
that<00:02:22.780> lead<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:24.370> new<00:02:24.550> mcom<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.330> this

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
that lead to the the new mcom and this

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.110 
that lead to the the new mcom and this
is<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.590> super<00:02:27.070> effective<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:27.700> half<00:02:27.910> your

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
is like super effective if half your

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.520 
is like super effective if half your
team<00:02:28.240> does<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.660> i<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.050> get<00:02:29.170> three

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
team does this i think you get three

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.760 
team does this i think you get three
apiece<00:02:29.860> that's<00:02:30.070> 18<00:02:30.730> mines<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.500> lot<00:02:32.740> of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
apiece that's 18 mines that's a lot of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.990 
apiece that's 18 mines that's a lot of
vehicles<00:02:33.010> they're<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.580> have<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.820> waste

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
vehicles they're going to have to waste

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.810 
vehicles they're going to have to waste
and<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.390> lot<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.810> tickets<00:02:35.020> they<00:02:35.380> lose<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.550> that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
and a lot of tickets they lose so that

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.270 
and a lot of tickets they lose so that
is<00:02:37.030> step<00:02:37.180> one<00:02:37.570> step<00:02:38.080> two<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.680> guys<00:02:38.950> need<00:02:39.250> to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
is step one step two you guys need to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.870 
is step one step two you guys need to
spot<00:02:39.640> everything<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.590> I've<00:02:41.590> tried<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.459> stress

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
spot everything and I've tried to stress

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.699 
spot everything and I've tried to stress
this<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.300> pretty<00:02:43.630> much<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:43.959> my<00:02:44.140> videos<00:02:44.290> but

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
this in pretty much all my videos but

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.160 
this in pretty much all my videos but
spotting<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.520> insanely<00:02:46.209> important<00:02:46.900> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
spotting is insanely important and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.500 
spotting is insanely important and
vehicles<00:02:48.160> even<00:02:48.370> more<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:48.940> need<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.239> swat

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
vehicles even more so you need to swat

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.780 
vehicles even more so you need to swat
them<00:02:49.660> regardless<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.220> plan<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.580> trying

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
them regardless of if you plan on trying

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.970 
them regardless of if you plan on trying
to<00:02:51.940> take<00:02:52.120> them<00:02:52.270> out<00:02:52.390> right<00:02:52.570> down<00:02:52.750> or<00:02:52.930> not<00:02:53.080> just

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
to take them out right down or not just

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.340 
to take them out right down or not just
spot<00:02:54.610> them<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.300> everyone<00:02:55.690> knows<00:02:55.959> are<00:02:56.170> there

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
spot them up so everyone knows are there

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.199 
spot them up so everyone knows are there
and<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:57.040> brings<00:02:57.190> me<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.760> next<00:02:57.790> part

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
and that brings me to the next part

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.560 
and that brings me to the next part
which<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.739> have<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.370> change<00:03:00.820> classes<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
which is you have to change classes and

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.300 
which is you have to change classes and
try<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.840> kill<00:03:02.080> them<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.590> try<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.010> destroy

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
try and kill them you try and destroy

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.760 
try and kill them you try and destroy
them<00:03:03.489> immediately<00:03:03.640> as<00:03:04.480> soon<00:03:05.230> as<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.530> see

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
them immediately as soon as you see

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.620 
them immediately as soon as you see
there's<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.040> vehicle<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.610> need<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.940> try<00:03:07.300> and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
there's a vehicle you need to try and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.520 
there's a vehicle you need to try and
take<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.050> out<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.750> know<00:03:10.900> does<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.350> mean

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
take it out and you know does that mean

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.930 
take it out and you know does that mean
everyone<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.160> team<00:03:12.370> honestly<00:03:12.790> it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
everyone on the team honestly it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.130 
everyone on the team honestly it
probably<00:03:12.970> wouldn't<00:03:13.540> hurt<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:13.840> much<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
probably wouldn't hurt that much of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140 
probably wouldn't hurt that much of
everyone<00:03:14.590> tried<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.100> destroy<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.760> vehicles

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
everyone tried to destroy the vehicles

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.509 
everyone tried to destroy the vehicles
but<00:03:16.900> no<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.110> mean<00:03:17.440> if<00:03:17.590> half<00:03:17.799> your<00:03:18.040> guys<00:03:18.220> do

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
but no I mean if half your guys do

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.870 
but no I mean if half your guys do
that's<00:03:18.850> probably<00:03:19.360> good<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:21.010> may<00:03:21.670> seem

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
that's probably good and it may seem

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.190 
that's probably good and it may seem
like<00:03:21.970> overkill<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:22.660> another<00:03:22.900> Cod

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
like overkill and that's another Cod

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.289 
like overkill and that's another Cod
thing<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.709> cod<00:03:24.010> you're<00:03:24.340> sort<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.670> trained<00:03:25.000> to

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
thing in cod you're sort of trained to

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.390 
thing in cod you're sort of trained to
one<00:03:26.260> guy<00:03:26.410> takes<00:03:26.650> care<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.890> them<00:03:27.010> that's<00:03:27.190> it

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
one guy takes care of them that's it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400 
one guy takes care of them that's it
that's<00:03:27.910> not<00:03:28.150> really<00:03:28.600> enough<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:29.140> in

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's not really enough in in

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.820 
that's not really enough in in
battlefield<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.790> need<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.120> all<00:03:31.360> all

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
prioritize them so even if you don't

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
things are super useful which I think

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.160 
things are super useful which I think
was<00:03:45.970> an<00:03:46.390> earlier<00:03:46.870> episode<00:03:47.049> also<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.930> step<00:03:49.930> one
