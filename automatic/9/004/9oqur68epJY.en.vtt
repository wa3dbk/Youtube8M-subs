00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.139
 we operate the fleet since 1992 as 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 20 years old and it's mine too 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 daughter on our farm live about 70 is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.800
 a horse 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 We do everything for islam for 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.970
 covering the area and teaching 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.960
 riding school children riding holidays 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 pension horse attitude still a bit 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 We are looking for our horses very much 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 they had to be right that is they 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 live here in the summer on paddocks and in the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.870
 winter half-year in the open stable so that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.899
 always move freely 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.540
 We try a very nice one for that 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.820
 to breed recreational horses and then hope 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.370
 always doing that also drives my sport 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.500
 out but come to resident try 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.800
 we breed horses that save everyone 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.800
 can 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.120
 it is tried that in 2012 I with its 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.790
 friend island flew around just after 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.590
 to do a young horse is there 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.990
 We then, among other things, on hercules 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.420
 I do not come across like that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.460
 ridden once but twice 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.250
 are bookable and not directly 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.050
 arose 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.790
 that was just the feeling that i was on 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.250
 Smooth that was the first step 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 because he is so amazing 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.280
 elastic gears has been quite flexible 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 quite comfortable too, yes, it's just fun 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.820
 made 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 in the first step 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.870
 Hercules has a pretty well known 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.970
 his father's name is Hauptgang 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.550
 level of making it from 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.650
 known dam pv venture long ago and the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.650
 mother goes back to holzmÃ¼ller 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.060
 Hercules is a very friendly one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 Wake up really easy 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.100
 to handle a stallion so there is 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.450
 the character really top that you can 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.599
 I think I have better 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 one can call him a gentleman he 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.650
 does not start immediately go and coat 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.440
 the gradual quasi as the request of other 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
 stallion but maybe starts first 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 to caress her a bit and wait 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.610
 really care that the study is now 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.610
 ready 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.519
 in the education of every horse 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.260
 you should actually pay attention to that 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.989
 you always rest with a lot of patience and patience 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 thing about the horses leaves the time 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.410
 you need it well that is now 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.560
 eight years in summer he is in island 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.209
 been attacked and twice 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.319
 one to appeal to a lot too 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.030
 been presented 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.560
 but not yet run in tournament 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.480
 Iceland we are the first tournament 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.670
 rode last year and stayed there 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.690
 also equal for the performance class 1 4 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.690
 then qualified 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.750
 In any case, the highlights are the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.780
 notes for spirit and falls it was 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.780
 each 785 as well for form under the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.370
 We are especially happy about riders 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.490
 Of course, about the note 9 had 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.670
 get twice for step and 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.840
 proportions 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.480
 especially to emphasize is everyone 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.490
 he will definitely be a part of it 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.630
 Fourgang continue to run the four 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.840
 on the circle for him already 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.930
 has qualified and in the near future 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.650
 I think I hope in the future, too 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.650
 2 instead 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.840
 my sporting goal for this year in 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.550
 this season is the qualification for 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.700
 German championship over the weir 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.110
 the lk 1 qualification in the fourth 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.730
 have already passed the exam 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.540

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.540
