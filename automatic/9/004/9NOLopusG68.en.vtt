and is this hand you was first of all
the<00:02:20.920> hand<00:02:21.510> he's<00:02:22.510> created<00:02:23.050> by<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.260> knowledge

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the hand he's created by the knowledge

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.620 
the hand he's created by the knowledge
you<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.510> hmm

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
you have of that hmm

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.720 
you have of that hmm
well<00:02:25.990> what<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.770> say<00:02:26.980> reminds<00:02:27.400> me<00:02:27.520> of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
well what you say reminds me of

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.370 
well what you say reminds me of
experiments<00:02:28.570> with<00:02:28.720> people<00:02:29.020> who<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.230> been

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
experiments with people who have been

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.890 
experiments with people who have been
blinded<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.100> then<00:02:30.220> their<00:02:30.750> operations<00:02:31.750> are

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
blinded and then their operations are

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.330 
blinded and then their operations are
performed<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.470> they<00:02:32.560> see<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.160> first

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
performed and they see for the first

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.550 
performed and they see for the first
time<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.090> they<00:02:34.150> don't<00:02:34.270> know<00:02:34.480> anything<00:02:34.780> they

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
time and they don't know anything they

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.860 
time and they don't know anything they
have<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.040> taught<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.580> recognize<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
have to be taught to recognize the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.720 
have to be taught to recognize the
things<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.260> they<00:02:38.410> see<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.100> without<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
things that they see so without the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.580 
things that they see so without the
mediation<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.480> mind<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.110> mind<00:02:41.320> is<00:02:41.470> not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
mediation of the mind if the mind is not

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.070 
mediation of the mind if the mind is not
trained<00:02:42.070> somehow<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> recognize<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:43.900> you're

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
trained somehow to recognize this you're

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.070 
trained somehow to recognize this you're
right<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.560> would<00:02:44.709> all<00:02:44.920> be<00:02:44.950> meaningless<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:46.480> we

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
right it would all be meaningless the we

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.520 
right it would all be meaningless the we
have<00:02:47.260> only<00:02:47.440> these<00:02:47.739> senses<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.120> know<00:02:49.530> these

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
have only these senses you know these

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.090 
have only these senses you know these
sensory<00:02:51.040> perceptions<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:52.270> not<00:02:52.510> say<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.260> this

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
sensory perceptions do not say that this

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.390 
sensory perceptions do not say that this
is<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> hand<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:56.080> see<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.440> knowledge<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> we

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
is a hand you see the knowledge that we

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.930 
is a hand you see the knowledge that we
have<00:02:57.720> tells<00:02:58.720> us<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> hand<00:03:00.640> and

eyes and with the world around you see
so<00:03:40.959> do<00:03:41.799> we<00:03:41.980> look<00:03:42.340> at<00:03:42.519> anything<00:03:43.060> see<00:03:43.420> this

so do we look at anything see this

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.750 
so do we look at anything see this
so-called<00:03:43.989> looking<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> blurred

way of looking at anything at all except
for<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.430> knowledge<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:53.079> it<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.380> necessary<00:03:54.010> for

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
for the knowledge so it is necessary for

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.780 
for the knowledge so it is necessary for
us<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.239> knowledge<00:03:55.930> otherwise<00:03:56.790> it

us to have that knowledge otherwise it
is<00:03:57.940> not<00:03:58.090> possible<00:03:58.150> for<00:03:58.600> us<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.049> function
