00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
ways they were too complicated or you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.419 
ways they were too complicated or you
had<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> buy<00:00:26.789> something<00:00:27.480> else<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.429> stand

or a tripod to map camel toe and just

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
or a tripod to map camel toe and just
seemed<00:00:32.520> too<00:00:32.700> complicated<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> tried<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
seemed too complicated so I tried to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
seemed too complicated so I tried to
come<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.710> own<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> doing<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
come up with my own way of doing it and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
come up with my own way of doing it and
I<00:00:36.090> did<00:00:36.570> find<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.930> way<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.410> basically<00:00:37.980> need<00:00:38.370> one

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I did find a way and basically need one

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
I did find a way and basically need one
thing<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> clamp<00:00:40.170> now<00:00:40.980> it's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
thing and that is a clamp now it's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
thing and that is a clamp now it's
better<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.600> plastic<00:00:42.989> one

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
better to use a plastic one

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
better to use a plastic one
jillee<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:45.210> won't<00:00:45.360> squish<00:00:45.719> your

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
jillee because there won't squish your

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.790 
jillee because there won't squish your
phone<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:47.690> most<00:00:48.690> iPhones<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.440> iPods

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
phone you can use most iPhones and iPods

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
phone you can use most iPhones and iPods
to<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.100> I'm<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.489> sure<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:51.030> it'll<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.239> with

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to this I'm not sure if it'll work with

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.560 
to this I'm not sure if it'll work with
any<00:00:51.780> Samsung's<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.969> most<00:00:53.969> people<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.420> an

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
any Samsung's but most people have an

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
any Samsung's but most people have an
Apple<00:00:54.780> device<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> house<00:00:55.500> anyway<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.579> I'm

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Apple device in the house anyway but I'm

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
Apple device in the house anyway but I'm
sure<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.180> work<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.660> some<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
sure it will work with some with a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.420 
sure it will work with some with a
Samsung<00:00:59.100> phone<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> yeah<00:01:01.079> basically<00:01:01.399> try<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
Samsung phone but yeah basically try to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.969 
Samsung phone but yeah basically try to
show<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> quality<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.619> get

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
show you the quality that you can get

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.649 
show you the quality that you can get
with<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> watch<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> watch<00:01:06.510> my

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
with it if you watch if you watch my

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.170 
with it if you watch if you watch my
last<00:01:06.689> video<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> would<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> seen<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.970> good

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
last video you would have seen how good

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.510 
last video you would have seen how good
the<00:01:09.330> quality<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the quality is like there you go you can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.719 
the quality is like there you go you can
move<00:01:11.880> around<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.520> downside<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
move around and the only downside to it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.940 
move around and the only downside to it
is<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:16.549> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.790> move<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> DF<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.229> move

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is that if you move the DF then you move

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.219 
is that if you move the DF then you move
the<00:01:20.070> camera<00:01:20.250> angle<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.759> stuff<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:22.020> can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the camera angle and stuff but you can

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.359 
the camera angle and stuff but you can
if<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> get<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:23.670> use<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
if you get if you don't use it the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.929 
if you get if you don't use it the
joypad<00:01:26.369> Deacon<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.700> be

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
joypad Deacon and just use it like it be

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.429 
joypad Deacon and just use it like it be
careful<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> should<00:01:30.960> move

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
careful what it should move

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.330 
careful what it should move
but<00:01:32.390> yeah<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.290> find<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.040> and
