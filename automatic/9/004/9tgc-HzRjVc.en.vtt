if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.810> charge<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> takes<00:00:32.070> about

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
if you charge it up so it takes about

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.389 
if you charge it up so it takes about
like<00:00:32.790> 16<00:00:33.420> bullets<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.350> kill<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.770> just

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

spamming<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.210> trigger<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> instead<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
spamming the trigger with it instead of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.680 
spamming the trigger with it instead of
charging<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.460> pretty<00:00:38.640> much<00:00:38.760> with

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
charging it up so it's pretty much with

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.900 
charging it up so it's pretty much with
their<00:00:39.870> both<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> plasma<00:00:40.649> pistol<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.190> then

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
their both the plasma pistol and then

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
their both the plasma pistol and then
I'm<00:00:42.239> gonna<00:00:42.360> test<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:43.020> further<00:00:43.320> range<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I'm gonna test it from further range and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.819 
I'm gonna test it from further range and
it<00:00:44.520> still<00:00:44.730> takes<00:00:44.940> 16<00:00:45.750> bullets<00:00:45.989> because

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it still takes 16 bullets because

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160 
it still takes 16 bullets because
there's<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.340> no<00:00:47.520> bloom<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.000> Halo<00:00:48.660> 4<00:00:48.930> like

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
there's like no bloom in Halo 4 like

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
there's like no bloom in Halo 4 like
there<00:00:49.289> wasn't<00:00:49.440> able<00:00:49.710> reach<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.700> should

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
there wasn't able reach so it should

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
there wasn't able reach so it should
still<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> same<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.649> long<00:00:52.980> range<00:00:53.309> though

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
still be the same but long range though

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
still be the same but long range though
you<00:00:54.059> since<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> pistol<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.260> start<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> see

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you since it's a pistol we start to see

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.220 
you since it's a pistol we start to see
a<00:00:55.860> significant<00:00:56.610> decrease<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> range<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
a significant decrease in range and it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
a significant decrease in range and it
takes<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.559> over<00:00:58.859> 20<00:00:59.039> bullets<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.670> kill<00:00:59.699> an
