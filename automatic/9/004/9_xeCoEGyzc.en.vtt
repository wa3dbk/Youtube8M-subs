00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.939
 car 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.980
 I will talk about how to grow the market 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.039
 It is planting this time 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.100
 What you need is heavy planter 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.500
 Strawberry seedling 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.070
 First place 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.670
 If necessary 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.780
 Entrepreneurship 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.780
 Then 3 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.680
 I use a shovel 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.400
 First planter less is here. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.240
 In the morning 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.700
 Note 2 liters with a planter 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.700
 Two strawberry seedlings are planted 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:56.120
 At first we put soil in planter 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:58.960
 Especially when using the yellow ocher which is white, there is no fertilizer and only sushi is used as a planter. 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.960
 please put it in 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.950
 When using commercially available culture soil 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.950
 As there are times when there is little fertilizer a little 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 Fertilizer on the head 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.960
 About 5 palms full 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.960
 Let's mix and increase in advance 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.800
 There is plenty of water if you have entered the soil in the planter 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.930
 Please put water evenly 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.520
 Also, if you do a lot of water at the same time, your father may become hard and you may get a little while 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.510
 Place 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.510
 Let's turn around again and do water when it gets soaked 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:13.970
 No. Let's choose healthy ones after dark green 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.800
 If there are brown or dead leaves from below, 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:23.870
 I will pick you up 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.870
 Also, if you have flower buds like this, pick them and plant them 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.470
 Then we will plant the seedlings 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.470
 Be careful with the crown when planting strawberry seedlings 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.660
 With crown 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.030
 It means the bulging part of the lower child 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.040
 Yes 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.440
 It is possible to plant it shallowly so that it is not buried in the soil 15 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.890
 It will be the point when planting 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:00.360
 The runner like this 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:07.250
 If it is out , flower buds appear in the opposite direction . 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:12.150
 If you plant it with the direction opposite to the runner facing you, you will see the strawberry fruits look beautiful 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.569
 We will plant two strawberries without this planter 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.890
 First of all 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.850
 Seedling 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.850
 We will receive the same size of earth on the ground 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.970
 there 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.040
 Don't plant a crown 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.040
 Put some sharks and sprinkle some soil 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.420
 Masu top of another share 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.420
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.930
 ban 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.440
 I will have plenty of water again if it increases 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.670
 At that time, let's water the stock source so that the leaves do not get water 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.000
 This is just as it is the culture soil of the kitchen garden for firewood 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.710
 I just planted a strawberry 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.740
 One bag contains 2 strains of strawberries 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.350
 After about 40 days from 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:49.750
 In this way, the stock grows big and the flower is blooming 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.750
 It is fun to move in this way when planting in various types of planters
