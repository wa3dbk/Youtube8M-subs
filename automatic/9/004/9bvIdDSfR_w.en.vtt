00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 I want to tell you how I do for orchids 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.930
 pots 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.490
 I have not failed to find 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.450
 transparent pots took for this such 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.450
 potty 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:29.630
 pass through and still going to make holes in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:34.230
 this will not need another cell 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 put in pins and that's why I will 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:46.500
 taking these little holes of these pots 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:51.920
 in all best of course transparent 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 Orchid ventilation was good 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:01.940
 air well and the light came in because 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.740
 they are such root systems need color and 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:15.140
 here are just such small things as well 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 holes all through but I have saplings 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:35.759
 now we also make holes here 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:41.150
 here do not hesitate to do a lot and here 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.659
 so warm up again 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:50.780
 there are such beautiful hooks I'll 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.780
 to know and a knife on this is not good 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 removed 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:15.250
 Here we have such a pot turned 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:20.060
 he is all a hole and he will be cute 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.260
 best to be transparent so they can 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.260
 see the root system 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.920
