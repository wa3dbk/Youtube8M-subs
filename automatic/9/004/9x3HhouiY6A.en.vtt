00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
in when you're trying to win a race this
is<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.080> are<00:01:52.259> fixing<00:01:52.710> when<00:01:53.100> we're

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
is what we are fixing when we're

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.820 
is what we are fixing when we're
drifting<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.570> physically<00:01:54.960> drift<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.619> must

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
drifting to physically drift you must

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.830 
drifting to physically drift you must
press<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> hold<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.759> Ellenor<00:01:57.270> button<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
press and hold the Ellenor button and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.680 
press and hold the Ellenor button and
let<00:01:58.740> them<00:01:58.920> run<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> directional<00:01:59.759> pad<00:01:59.820> while

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
let them run the directional pad while

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.749 
let them run the directional pad while
still<00:02:01.020> holding<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:02.100> B<00:02:02.280> button

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
still holding the B button

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.020 
still holding the B button
this<00:02:03.000> results<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.750> drift<00:02:04.050> itself<00:02:05.030> however

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this results in the drift itself however

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
this results in the drift itself however
after<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> drift<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:06.990> must<00:02:07.259> counter<00:02:07.679> steer

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
after the drift you must counter steer

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.980 
after the drift you must counter steer
by<00:02:08.100> repressing<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> jump<00:02:09.030> button<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
by repressing the jump button and the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.080 
by repressing the jump button and the
opposite<00:02:10.410> direction<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:11.160> button<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> way

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
opposite direction or button to the way

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.740 
opposite direction or button to the way
you're<00:02:12.300> drifting

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you're drifting

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.220 
you're drifting
you<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.790> Stoffer<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> counter<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
you see Stoffer the counter this is the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.250 
you see Stoffer the counter this is the
counter<00:02:22.590> steer<00:02:22.830> pot<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.940> scenario<00:02:24.330> if

counter steer pot in this scenario if

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.650 
counter steer pot in this scenario if
you<00:02:25.410> are<00:02:25.680> drifting<00:02:26.190> left<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:27.150> must<00:02:27.360> press

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you are drifting left you must press

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.990 
you are drifting left you must press
right<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.020> jump<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:29.160> allows<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.819> go

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
right and jump this allows you to go

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.850 
right and jump this allows you to go
straight<00:02:30.060> ahead<00:02:30.569> onto<00:02:31.020> drifting<00:02:31.560> which<00:02:31.710> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
straight ahead onto drifting which is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.090 
straight ahead onto drifting which is
essential<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.550> get<00:02:32.850> good<00:02:33.030> time<00:02:36.740> this<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
essential to get good time this is the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:47.120 
essential to get good time this is the
whole<00:02:38.370> drift<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.090> after<00:02:45.870> some<00:02:46.080> practice<00:02:46.290> you

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
whole drift and after some practice you

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.070 
whole drift and after some practice you
will<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.280> able<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.640> drift<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.090> all<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.600> corners

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
will be able to drift on all the corners

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.010 
will be able to drift on all the corners
