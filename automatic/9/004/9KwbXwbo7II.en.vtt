00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:14.610
 one more so she started the clanwar attacks 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 next night full 9 it means that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.109
 we are here or here we see negros say 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 honestly with honest blacks i'm not attacking 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.500
 we are generally able therefore to comment 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 somehow it is so he will hardly succeed me 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 but I will try it while it happens 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.410
 elementary things lures in crowns 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:47.610
 cash register why spend magician why you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.520
 poppy is spent and quite a few of you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.300
 stays for killing honkasta seems 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.329
 heroes of the end will be used 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 it would be possible to take valka which this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.240
 clan touch one turn 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 destroyed I do not know the only thing that even 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 what is it that 40 blacks on 9 there remembers it 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.689
 lot 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.060
 because even though floor 9 is like 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.610
 all the same such here these 10 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.770
 there floor throws frost on the queen grandfather 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.430
 frost on the queen scatters jars 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 phase 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.790
 throws jars ahead of the curve so 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:53.240
 that one jar was not a jar all 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:53.240
 until it goes well it will be destroyed and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:05.250
 he still has heroes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:13.590
 just about the most important mistake of this base in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:18.450
 the fact that there are holes here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.580
 holes supposedly someone smart one who 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.670
 owns this base also put the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.470
 test Well here I am such a tricky hole in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.470
 the base is such a trap 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.120
 nothing like what's done with such 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.400
 Dies for the future, remember if 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.690
 Take such bases with you I do not know 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.870
 giant k1 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.200
 you let here and better take the barbarians 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.150
 take the barbarians here k come here and 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.580
 lure the battles of his soldiers 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.670
 literally two or three barbarians and no plank 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.560
 will lure out without any heat 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:01.079
 all why all because there is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:07.040
 holes here it is insulting it is insulting and it 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:10.380
 annoyingly it's not good 99 percent neither 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.410
 Defoe one building on the basis of left and 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.799
 all why and all because it was taken 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.209
 with 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:23.880
 and how was the little archers taken up for 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.450
 luring parks and wasting money 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.850
 smog 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.920
 but that's okay somebody will finish 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.890
 this opponent in fact here are three 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.370
 the stars and it's beautiful it means everything goes 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.370
 well and there is no reason for panic and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:50.620
 leaf that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:54.930
 what are you now 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:59.769
 I did not understand stop stop stop now 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.620
 personally watched as the nickname filled in 99 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:07.420
 percent and two stars 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 but clash of clans shows me 3 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.459
 stars 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.810
 although I recorded a video on video 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.959
 two stars 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:24.160
 that he did not have enough time to look more 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.500
 time means it doesnâ€™t get robbed all over 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.530
 database who did not catch 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 see my comments for the first time 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.000
 now it means everything runs all here 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.020
 explodes everything breaks starts off 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.349
 skeleton plank will go in a circle with 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:52.630
 so with these attempts to get to 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:56.500
 center in the end now this whole edge plus 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:01.090
 bear king long fence karon long 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.570
 fence mages dishes store precisely one 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.680
 Macbeth storage and that's who does not remember here 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.460
 at this moment I was getting 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.300
 the fight stopped and there was 99 percent 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.900
 2 stars 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.490
 but somehow it will continue 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:28.110
 yourself advice the fight goes on and 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:31.479
 some time left to finish 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.940
 no it is of course good it is us 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.150
 only at hand because the extra star 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.310
 in the piggy bank the clan is never too much 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.440
 it is absurd absurd did not sound but still 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.440
 this game never ceases to amaze me
