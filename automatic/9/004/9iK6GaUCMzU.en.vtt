Baptista grabs faces there and now he's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
Baptista grabs faces there and now he's
all<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> non<00:01:57.840> skills<00:01:58.140> let's<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
all over the non skills let's see the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
all over the non skills let's see the
mental<00:01:59.069> skills<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.549> try<00:01:59.909> hunting<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.539> right

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
mental skills is try hunting but right

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
mental skills is try hunting but right
now<00:02:00.929> I<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.709> ABS<00:02:02.039> are<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.640> been

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
now I can see these ABS are not been

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.779 
now I can see these ABS are not been
perfectly<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.350> way<00:02:04.619> his<00:02:05.250> abs<00:02:05.609> are

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
perfectly the right way his abs are

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.210 
perfectly the right way his abs are
bending<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.329> words<00:02:06.539> instead<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.109> outwards<00:02:07.619> so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
bending in words instead of outwards so

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.580 
bending in words instead of outwards so
this<00:02:08.489> tripod<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.269> very<00:02:09.899> close<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> ground

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this tripod is very close to the ground

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.119 
this tripod is very close to the ground
and<00:02:11.299> you'll<00:02:12.299> see<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:13.049> he<00:02:13.680> comes<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> this

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
and you'll see this as he comes to this

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.270 
and you'll see this as he comes to this
point<00:02:14.340> here<00:02:14.700> where<00:02:15.560> instead<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.620> his<00:02:16.980> abs

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
point here where instead of his abs

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.360 
point here where instead of his abs
being<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.690> way<00:02:18.989> he<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.769> have<00:02:19.860> had<00:02:20.010> much<00:02:20.340> of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
being this way he would have had much of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.660 
being this way he would have had much of
a<00:02:20.610> curved<00:02:20.970> angle<00:02:21.480> instead<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.079> this<00:02:22.769> year<00:02:23.160> he's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
a curved angle instead of this year he's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.819 
a curved angle instead of this year he's
also<00:02:23.819> got<00:02:24.000> his<00:02:24.120> leg<00:02:24.420> lifted<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:24.989> that's<00:02:25.319> his

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
also got his leg lifted up so that's his

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.130 
also got his leg lifted up so that's his
main<00:02:26.160> idea<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:27.090> he<00:02:27.150> lost<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.690> game<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.019> he

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
main idea of how he lost the game and he

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.559 
main idea of how he lost the game and he
brought<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> down<00:02:28.560> again<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:30.030> ended<00:02:30.450> up

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
brought it down again and this ended up

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.600 
brought it down again and this ended up
very<00:02:30.810> badly<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.530> that's<00:02:31.980> very<00:02:32.340> flustered

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
very badly because that's very flustered

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.369 
very badly because that's very flustered
around<00:02:32.819> yeah<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.599> probably<00:02:33.900> shouldn't<00:02:34.290> have

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
around yeah you probably shouldn't have

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.890 
around yeah you probably shouldn't have
lifted<00:02:34.920> your<00:02:35.040> leg<00:02:35.280> either<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:36.000> yeah<00:02:36.629> so

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
lifted your leg either but yeah so

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.210 
lifted your leg either but yeah so
basically<00:02:37.290> let's<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.739> how<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.040> save

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
basically let's see how you can save

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.420 
basically let's see how you can save
this<00:02:38.370> table<00:02:38.640> let's<00:02:39.629> see<00:02:39.720> from<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:40.430> then

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
this table let's see from here then

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.479 
this table let's see from here then
those<00:02:41.730> AB<00:02:41.970> Androids<00:02:42.620> keep<00:02:43.620> them<00:02:43.799> in<00:02:43.950> words<00:02:44.099> it

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
those AB Androids keep them in words it

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.869 
those AB Androids keep them in words it
gives<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.569> strongly<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.549> tripod

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
gives you more strongly in a tripod

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.119 
gives you more strongly in a tripod
position<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.900> then<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:50.010> everything

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
position and then you just do everything

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.589 
position and then you just do everything
else<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:50.970> where<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.180> goes

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
else and then see where it goes

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.710 
else and then see where it goes
unless<00:02:52.079> replay<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.739> by<00:02:52.950> reoww<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.359> shaky

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
unless replay is by reoww and the shaky

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.110 
unless replay is by reoww and the shaky
absence<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.500> let's<00:02:55.889> see<00:02:56.099> we<00:02:56.400> all<00:02:56.609> just<00:02:56.880> got

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
absence so let's see we all just got

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.430 
absence so let's see we all just got
thrown<00:02:57.599> against<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> ground<00:02:59.660> BAM<00:03:00.690> okay<00:03:01.380> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.450 
least you land it you see you gotta land
it<00:03:37.420> like<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:38.380> when<00:03:38.980> you're<00:03:39.130> going<00:03:39.250> down

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
it like that like when you're going down

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.490 
it like that like when you're going down
really<00:03:39.730> hard<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.150> keep<00:03:40.360> your<00:03:40.600> wrist<00:03:41.020> in<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
really hard to keep your wrist in and

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.930 
really hard to keep your wrist in and
sometimes<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.950> keep<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.220> out<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.460> depends<00:03:42.790> on

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
sometimes you keep it out it depends on

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.340 
sometimes you keep it out it depends on
how<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.180> paddle<00:03:43.780> lands<00:03:43.990> on<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.200> wrist

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
how the paddle lands on the wrist

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.870
