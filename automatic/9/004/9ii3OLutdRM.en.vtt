and<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.100> confusion<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and there's also some confusion I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.689 
and there's also some confusion I
opinion<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.530> figure<00:00:58.890> has<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.309> absolutely

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
opinion this figure has an absolutely

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.250 
opinion this figure has an absolutely
brilliant<00:00:59.969> likeness<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> actor<00:01:00.750> who

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
brilliant likeness to the actor who

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
brilliant likeness to the actor who
played<00:01:01.500> Bracewell<00:01:02.100> bill<00:01:02.699> perhaps<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.120> certain

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
played Bracewell bill perhaps a certain

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.570 
played Bracewell bill perhaps a certain
thing<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> doesn't<00:01:04.229> look<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.710> much<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.010> as

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
thing it doesn't look as much like as

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
thing it doesn't look as much like as
the<00:01:05.729> prototype<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.930> figure<00:01:07.260> did<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the prototype at this figure did but it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.160 
the prototype at this figure did but it
still<00:01:08.040> looks<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.340> lot<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.090> opinion<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
still looks a lot like in my opinion and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.690 
still looks a lot like in my opinion and
I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> shame<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
I think it is a bit of a shame that the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
I think it is a bit of a shame that the
glasses<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.510> oversized<00:01:12.990> though<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
glasses look a bit oversized though and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
glasses look a bit oversized though and
the<00:01:14.490> glass<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> prints<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the glass is on the prints on this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.499 
the glass is on the prints on this
figure<00:01:16.049> look<00:01:16.229> perfect<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.060> ones<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
figure look perfect but the ones on the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
figure look perfect but the ones on the
actual<00:01:18.780> figure<00:01:19.080> look<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.500> bit<00:01:19.770> too<00:01:19.979> big<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.369> my

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
actual figure look a bit too big in my

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.149 
actual figure look a bit too big in my
view<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> bit<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> shame<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:22.159> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
view which is a bit of a shame as you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520

really<00:02:07.320> lifelike<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:08.099> my<00:02:08.280> opinion<00:02:08.899> jacket<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
really lifelike in my opinion jacket is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
really lifelike in my opinion jacket is
made<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.500> very<00:02:11.150> bendy<00:02:12.470> material

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
made of a very bendy material

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.190 
made of a very bendy material
if<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.220> plastic<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> said<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.170> very

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
if it is plastic but like I said is very

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.530 
if it is plastic but like I said is very
bendy<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:17.790> I'm<00:02:17.910> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.240> go<00:02:18.360> through

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
bendy and now I'm going to go through

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.780 
bendy and now I'm going to go through
the<00:02:18.660> articulation<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.890> figure<00:02:20.130> okay<00:02:20.730> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the articulation of this figure okay so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.990 
the articulation of this figure okay so
the<00:02:20.940> head<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.630> turn<00:02:21.660> 360<00:02:22.650> degrees<00:02:23.130> well<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the head can turn 360 degrees well I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.530 
the head can turn 360 degrees well I
think<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.790> don't<00:02:26.790> want<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.030> turn<00:02:27.360> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
think it can but I don't want to turn it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.790 
think it can but I don't want to turn it
all<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.660> way<00:02:27.780> around<00:02:28.050> because<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> could

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
all the way around because I could

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.380 
all the way around because I could
probably<00:02:28.830> get<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.460> paint<00:02:29.700> scratches<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
probably get some paint scratches on the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.390 
probably get some paint scratches on the
neck<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.470> don't<00:02:31.680> want<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.920> happening<00:02:32.340> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
neck and I don't want that happening to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.200 
neck and I don't want that happening to

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
this one we can see that it is the same

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.250 
this one we can see that it is the same
sculpt<00:04:06.750> as<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.410> other<00:04:08.280> arm<00:04:08.610> but<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.299> time<00:04:09.660> we

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
sculpt as the other arm but this time we

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.220 
sculpt as the other arm but this time we
can<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.070> damaged<00:04:11.970> Dalek<00:04:12.390> technology<00:04:12.570> at

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
can see the damaged Dalek technology at
