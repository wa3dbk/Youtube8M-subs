00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
sounds bad I know but it was a place

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.729 
sounds bad I know but it was a place
where<00:02:43.189> only<00:02:43.730> cheaters<00:02:44.569> could<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.650> if

where only cheaters could go so if

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.770 
where only cheaters could go so if

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.149 
there's only one cheater you're going in
there<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.349> know<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.620> that's<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.980> you're

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
there you know and that's it you're

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.890 
there you know and that's it you're
alone<00:02:49.459> for<00:02:49.879> I<00:02:50.150> don't<00:02:50.510> know<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.659> might<00:02:50.780> have

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
alone for I don't know it might have

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.690 
alone for I don't know it might have
been<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.019> week<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.439> day<00:02:51.650> however<00:02:52.280> long<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.549> was

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
been a week a day however long it was

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.330 
been a week a day however long it was
okay<00:02:53.180> they've<00:02:53.810> started<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.709> improve<00:02:54.859> upon

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
okay they've started to improve upon

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.580 
okay they've started to improve upon
this<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.239> multiplayer<00:02:56.750> isn't<00:02:56.989> only<00:02:57.260> going

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
this so the multiplayer isn't only going

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.170 
this so the multiplayer isn't only going
to<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.769> big<00:02:58.040> because<00:02:58.400> they've<00:02:58.790> said<00:02:59.030> it's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
to be big because they've said it's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.119 
to be big because they've said it's
themselves<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.200> they're<00:03:00.469> you<00:03:01.099> know

themselves that they're you know

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.280 
themselves that they're you know
essentially<00:03:01.969> it<00:03:02.510> looks<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:03.019> they're<00:03:03.200> going

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
essentially it looks like they're going

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.740 
essentially it looks like they're going
to<00:03:03.349> be<00:03:03.409> dedicating<00:03:04.099> an<00:03:04.219> entire<00:03:04.389> game<00:03:05.389> to<00:03:05.629> it

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
customization and that we'll probably be

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.129 
customization and that we'll probably be
able<00:03:33.919> to<00:03:34.069> have<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.819> know<00:03:35.139> interchangeable

you can even tune-up your engine make it

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.949 
you can even tune-up your engine make it
a<00:03:40.729> little<00:03:40.879> bit<00:03:41.120> too<00:03:41.329> big<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.720> know<00:03:41.810> if<00:03:41.870> you

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
a little bit too big you know if you

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.479 
a little bit too big you know if you
have<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.199> so<00:03:42.379> fast<00:03:42.680> you're<00:03:42.919> probably<00:03:43.159> gonna

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
have it so fast you're probably gonna

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.789 
have it so fast you're probably gonna
need<00:03:43.699> better<00:03:43.970> brakes<00:03:44.329> such<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.470> okay

will<00:03:54.470> come<00:03:54.680> out<00:03:54.709> with<00:03:54.919> it<00:03:55.040> later<00:03:55.250> on<00:03:55.459> but<00:03:55.609> it<00:03:55.759> is

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
will come out with it later on but it is

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.869 
will come out with it later on but it is
going<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.419> be<00:03:56.509> very<00:03:56.780> deep<00:03:57.109> now<00:03:57.949> deep<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.579> me<00:03:58.729> and

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
going to be very deep now deep to me and

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.890 
going to be very deep now deep to me and
depth<00:03:59.650> involves<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.949> lot<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.699> control<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.569> being

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
depth involves a lot of control of being

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.729 
depth involves a lot of control of being
in<00:04:03.049> the<00:04:03.139> users<00:04:03.590> hands<00:04:04.000> when<00:04:05.000> let's<00:04:05.989> say<00:04:06.169> low

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
in the users hands when let's say low

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.589 
in the users hands when let's say low
level<00:04:07.099> customization<00:04:07.939> to<00:04:08.030> me<00:04:08.209> would<00:04:08.389> be

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
level customization to me would be

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.499 
level customization to me would be
finding<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.500> weapon<00:04:09.799> on<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.040> floor<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.759> has<00:04:11.150> a

know<00:04:57.110> how<00:04:57.229> many<00:04:57.290> people<00:04:57.530> would<00:04:57.740> remember<00:04:57.950> this

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
know how many people would remember this

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.620 
know how many people would remember this
because<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.580> wasn't<00:04:58.820> really<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.030> very<00:04:59.180> popular

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
because it wasn't really a very popular

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.450 
because it wasn't really a very popular
game<00:04:59.810> there<00:05:00.050> was<00:05:00.110> third-person<00:05:00.620> cage<00:05:01.190> match

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
game there was third-person cage match

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.610 
game there was third-person cage match
which<00:05:01.729> was<00:05:01.940> essentially<00:05:02.479> a<00:05:02.510> 1v1<00:05:02.960> but<00:05:03.410> it<00:05:03.500> was

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
which was essentially a 1v1 but it was

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.520 
which was essentially a 1v1 but it was
third-person<00:05:04.160> Call<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:04.970> Duty<00:05:05.540> strip<00:05:06.380> it<00:05:06.500> down

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
third-person Call of Duty strip it down

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.159 
third-person Call of Duty strip it down
you've<00:05:06.889> essentially<00:05:07.340> got<00:05:07.490> GTA<00:05:08.330> ok<00:05:08.960> very

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
you've essentially got GTA ok very

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.510 
you've essentially got GTA ok very
slightly<00:05:09.560> different<00:05:09.919> but<00:05:10.040> of<00:05:10.130> course<00:05:10.340> it's

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
slightly different but of course it's

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.370 
slightly different but of course it's
over<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.790> shoulder<00:05:11.150> still<00:05:11.360> if<00:05:11.990> you<00:05:12.200> were<00:05:12.290> to

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
over the shoulder still if you were to

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.370 
over the shoulder still if you were to
have<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.950> naked<00:05:13.850> weapon<00:05:14.330> okay<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:14.810> just<00:05:14.960> have<00:05:15.260> a

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
have a naked weapon okay you just have a

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.350 
have a naked weapon okay you just have a
normal<00:05:15.590> eye<00:05:16.010> in<00:05:16.190> sight<00:05:16.460> wherever<00:05:16.970> you'd<00:05:17.150> have

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
normal eye in sight wherever you'd have

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.080 
normal eye in sight wherever you'd have
a<00:05:17.539> particular<00:05:18.260> view<00:05:18.650> if<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.280> had<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> red<00:05:19.850> dot<00:05:20.060> a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
a particular view if you had a red dot a

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.450 
a particular view if you had a red dot a
holographic<00:05:20.720> or<00:05:21.050> an<00:05:21.139> ACOG<00:05:21.500> progressively

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
holographic or an ACOG progressively

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.300 
holographic or an ACOG progressively
you'd<00:05:22.669> have<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.240> closer<00:05:23.840> view<00:05:24.260> at<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.979> screen

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
you'd have a closer view at the screen

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.920 
you'd have a closer view at the screen
okay<00:05:25.729> it'd<00:05:25.850> get<00:05:26.000> closer<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.510> you<00:05:26.660> could<00:05:26.810> be

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
okay it'd get closer and you could be

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.930 
okay it'd get closer and you could be
more<00:05:27.110> accurate<00:05:27.590> that's<00:05:27.860> how<00:05:28.100> it<00:05:28.250> affected<00:05:28.820> in

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
more accurate that's how it affected in

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.150 
more accurate that's how it affected in
Call<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.180> Duty<00:05:29.660> I'd<00:05:30.200> imagine<00:05:30.350> if<00:05:30.800> that's<00:05:30.979> gonna

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
Call of Duty I'd imagine if that's gonna

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.580 
Call of Duty I'd imagine if that's gonna
be<00:05:31.340> in<00:05:31.430> GTA<00:05:31.789> that's<00:05:32.510> probably<00:05:33.020> how<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.289> would

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
be in GTA that's probably how it would

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.590 
be in GTA that's probably how it would
be<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.800> don't<00:05:33.919> really<00:05:34.340> know<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:35.090> that's<00:05:35.270> what

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
be I don't really know but that's what

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.629 
be I don't really know but that's what
I'd<00:05:35.720> imagine<00:05:36.229> I'd<00:05:36.590> also<00:05:36.830> like<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:37.280> think<00:05:37.490> that

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
I'd imagine I'd also like to think that

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.040 
I'd imagine I'd also like to think that
if<00:05:37.760> you're<00:05:37.910> playing<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.479> game<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.840> would<00:05:38.900> be

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
if you're playing the game it would be

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.260 
if you're playing the game it would be
very<00:05:39.229> similar<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.680> Max<00:05:39.889> Payne<00:05:40.130> 3<00:05:40.190> style<00:05:41.030> of

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
very similar to Max Payne 3 style of

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.900 
very similar to Max Payne 3 style of
weaponry<00:05:41.599> which<00:05:42.200> was<00:05:42.470> very<00:05:42.710> very<00:05:43.099> much<00:05:43.639> more

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
weaponry which was very very much more

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.020 
weaponry which was very very much more
advanced<00:05:44.240> than<00:05:44.570> GTA<00:05:44.990> falls<00:05:45.700> okay<00:05:46.700> we've<00:05:46.880> had<00:05:46.970> a

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
advanced than GTA falls okay we've had a

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.330 
advanced than GTA falls okay we've had a
chat<00:05:47.270> about<00:05:47.300> both<00:05:47.660> multiplayer<00:05:48.289> and<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:49.220> know

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
chat about both multiplayer and you know

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.710 
chat about both multiplayer and you know
weapons<00:05:49.550> and<00:05:49.910> we've<00:05:50.000> kind<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.270> actually<00:05:50.570> put

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
weapons and we've kind of actually put

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.450 
weapons and we've kind of actually put
them<00:05:50.840> in<00:05:50.960> together<00:05:51.080> so<00:05:51.770> that<00:05:52.099> would<00:05:52.220> be<00:05:52.310> pretty

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
them in together so that would be pretty

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.190 
them in together so that would be pretty
