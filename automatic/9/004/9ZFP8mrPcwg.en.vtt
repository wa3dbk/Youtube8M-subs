00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.560
 best tastes block of amazon 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.449
 program block that now that we 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.400
 Let's try these delicacies more 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.759
 before here on my side I 'm with the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.030
 renata and with michelle that the two 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.460
 part of the same business that is 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.020
 brigadeiro the two full- pots 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.000
 michelle you met here during the 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.200
 program that she taught you to do everything 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.270
 service and helped me stir brigadeiro 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.480
 because there is a whole technique is not so 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.030
 easy as we imagine it to be. 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.490
 half is born into a whole practice and a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.740
 technique to make brigadeiros and exit 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.710
 very beautiful with the one here in the 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.840
 our front but renata nere and nothing that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.970
 was not reached in são paulo lived in 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.549
 other places is not any of that either 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.070
 tell me how it was your idea of 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.439
 to unite because it looks just 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.630
 tucumán sea wall there had never seen 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.210
 This is not what it is then I have 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.640
 a partner who also loves to cook 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.640
 she also explains the wonderful 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.690
 We keep raising the brigadeiros and there 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 My family has a 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.640
 mexico to flour and did not say poxa vou 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.560
 make a candy with the flour that I think 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.080
 that's cool, it's gonna be cool 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.870
 and then we tested the tucumã with the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.600
 flour then came to the pacaembu band 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.020
 nec are typical things from here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.940
 Region forced us to put 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.890
 Just kidding, things from here. 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 because as it is in the place that has great 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.540
 movement is of tourist then they 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 they seek precisely this differential 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.000
 so we tried to do all the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.670
 regional worsening 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.650
 So, there's one missing. 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.380
 developing what the poor guy puts 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.420
 the market also in renata as it was to see if 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.820
 we bring shelly shetty also likes 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 cook and then came with the pilot 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.350
 She is also mine, she loves me. 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.930
 cook chef worked with me 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.450
 my brother and then later I brought her 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.660
 to make sweets with me in the kitchen 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.580
 provided they have the laws of goose since 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.250
 Child I like to cook my 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.360
 Partner likes to stay there too. 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.580

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.739
 I have two the kitchen so they 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.600
 They love to do everything and the renata 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.880
 too, do not you guys like to cook? 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.160
 but here behind the scenes the daughter 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.590
 of renata is present and she told 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.570
 for the agency that the renata can not be 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.330
 leave a brigadier in the refrigerator in the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.420

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.209
 I adore her, she's joking. 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.730
 from her home country the brigadeiros and there the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.580
 people eat spoons and rolls nothing 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.220
 Then it is only once in a while that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.750
 It makes me question where I ate everything right there 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.060
 Mexico, thank you every day at the end 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.890

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.310
 brigadeiro even more using all 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.890

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.010

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.990

 he is not strong he is not very soft 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.459
 and the flour also barely 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.220
 just a crunch on the brigadeiro 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.259

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.030
