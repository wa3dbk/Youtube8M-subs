anti<00:00:07.500> Minj<00:00:07.740> chips<00:00:08.599> the<00:00:09.599> first<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.110> which<00:00:10.230> I

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
anti Minj chips the first of which I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.870 
anti Minj chips the first of which I
call<00:00:11.460> death<00:00:11.940> prop<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:13.080> very<00:00:13.530> very<00:00:14.099> handy<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
call death prop is very very handy on a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.870 
call death prop is very very handy on a
death<00:00:15.389> matching<00:00:15.839> server<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.400> these<00:00:17.550> chips

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
death matching server all of these chips

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.250 
death matching server all of these chips
use<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.640> combine<00:00:20.640> helicopter<00:00:21.180> ball<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.660> I'll

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
use the combine helicopter ball so I'll

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.769 
use the combine helicopter ball so I'll
just<00:00:22.529> spawn<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> couple<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.430> them<00:00:23.660> just<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
just spawn a couple of them just to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.439 
just spawn a couple of them just to
begin<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.220> chip<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.939> death<00:00:27.150> prop

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
begin with with this chip the death prop

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.560 
begin with with this chip the death prop
chip<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> press<00:00:28.710> e<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.250> proper<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
chip when I press e on a proper it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.139 
chip when I press e on a proper it
selects<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:32.040> makes<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.520> float<00:00:32.880> above

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
selects it and that makes it float above

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.340 
selects it and that makes it float above
my<00:00:33.360> head<00:00:33.710> until<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> left<00:00:35.640> click<00:00:36.350> at

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
my head until that is I left click at

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.740 
my head until that is I left click at
which<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> point<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.190> time

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
which to point in time

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
which to point in time
smashes<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> ground<00:00:40.219> now<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.579> prop<00:00:41.940> also

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
smashes to the ground now that prop also

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.490 
smashes to the ground now that prop also
weighs<00:00:43.040> 50,000<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.450> capable<00:00:46.170> at

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
weighs 50,000 so it's very capable at

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.549 
weighs 50,000 so it's very capable at
crushing<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:47.370> killing<00:00:47.930> anything<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.110> anyone

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
crushing or killing anything or anyone

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.420 
crushing or killing anything or anyone
now<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.820> left<00:00:51.120> click<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.660> hold<00:00:51.960> left<00:00:52.199> click

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
now if I left click or hold left click

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
now if I left click or hold left click
it<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.489> keeps<00:00:53.969> slamming<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it just keeps slamming back on the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
it just keeps slamming back on the
ground<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.610> click<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.480> just

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
ground but if I right click it just

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
ground but if I right click it just
keeps<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:58.710> looking<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.489> it's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
keeps going to where I'm looking so it's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
keeps going to where I'm looking so it's
very<00:00:59.789> handy<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.300> check<00:01:00.719> fast-moving<00:01:01.199> people

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
very handy for check fast-moving people

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549 
very handy for check fast-moving people
or<00:01:02.219> vehicles<00:01:02.840> now<00:01:03.840> I've<00:01:04.080> built<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.379> little

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
or vehicles now I've built a little

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.399 
or vehicles now I've built a little
wooden<00:01:04.890> fort<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.479> show<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> how

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
wooden fort here just to show you how

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.390 
wooden fort here just to show you how
fun<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:09.409> hold<00:01:10.409> click<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
fun it is you can just hold click and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.230 
fun it is you can just hold click and
just<00:01:11.430> keep<00:01:12.619> destroying

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.990 

four<00:01:20.240> demolished<00:01:22.420> now<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.380> that's<00:01:26.050> that<00:01:28.000> no

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
four demolished now so that's that no

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.320 
four demolished now so that's that no
mind

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
mind

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.410 
mind
that's<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.840> chip<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.830> next<00:01:31.190> chip<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.760> the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
that's that chip the next chip is the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.560 
that's that chip the next chip is the
antigrav<00:01:33.380> gonna<00:01:33.680> tack<00:01:33.950> chip<00:01:34.280> now<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.540> a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
antigrav gonna tack chip now this is a

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.040 
antigrav gonna tack chip now this is a
very<00:01:35.990> useful<00:01:36.200> chip<00:01:36.680> what<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:37.550> does<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:38.690> it

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
very useful chip what it does is it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.980 
very useful chip what it does is it
makes<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.100> ball<00:01:40.520> move<00:01:41.030> above<00:01:41.300> your<00:01:41.479> head<00:01:41.659> once

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
makes the ball move above your head once

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.790 
makes the ball move above your head once
again<00:01:42.280> but<00:01:43.280> if<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.420> prop<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.840> thrown<00:01:45.229> at<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.619> by

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
again but if a prop is thrown at you by

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.380 
again but if a prop is thrown at you by
this<00:01:46.040> gravity<00:01:46.790> gun<00:01:46.970> simulator<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:48.680> will<00:01:49.390> block

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
this gravity gun simulator it will block

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.770 
this gravity gun simulator it will block
it<00:01:50.420> by<00:01:51.229> knocking<00:01:51.410> it<00:01:51.619> out<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.920> way<00:01:52.600> as<00:01:53.600> we

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
it by knocking it out of the way as we

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.410 
it by knocking it out of the way as we
just<00:01:53.930> saw<00:01:56.229> see<00:01:57.229> just<00:01:57.979> comes<00:01:58.789> down<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.270> knocks

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
just saw see just comes down and knocks

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.370 
just saw see just comes down and knocks
it<00:01:59.750> out<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.050> way

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
it out of the way

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.930 
it out of the way
whoo<00:02:01.690> actually<00:02:02.860> not<00:02:03.860> all<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.160> time<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.880> is

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
whoo actually not all the time but it is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.520 
whoo actually not all the time but it is
definitely<00:02:05.750> better<00:02:06.080> than<00:02:06.590> nothing<00:02:08.170> see<00:02:09.170> just

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
definitely better than nothing see just

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.990 
definitely better than nothing see just
stopping<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:11.440> very<00:02:12.440> handy<00:02:12.769> but<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.250> also<00:02:13.489> knows

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
stopping it very handy but it also knows

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.360 
stopping it very handy but it also knows
if<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.110> prop<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.440> actually<00:02:15.800> going<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.010> hit<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
if the prop is actually going to hit you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.979 
if the prop is actually going to hit you
and<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:17.450> isn't<00:02:17.930> gonna<00:02:18.110> hit<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:19.519> won't

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
and if it isn't gonna hit you it won't

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.740 
and if it isn't gonna hit you it won't
attempt<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.290> block<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:22.060> which<00:02:23.060> makes<00:02:23.299> it<00:02:23.540> very

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
attempt to block it which makes it very

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.450 
attempt to block it which makes it very
useful

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.960 

of<00:02:28.060> course<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:29.350> not<00:02:29.680> very<00:02:29.980> effective<00:02:30.310> at

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
of course it's not very effective at

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.860 
of course it's not very effective at
point-blank<00:02:31.390> range<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.670> final<00:02:36.670> chip<00:02:37.000> let

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
point-blank range now the final chip let

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.730 
point-blank range now the final chip let
me<00:02:37.960> just<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.260> rid<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.470> these<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.610> final<00:02:40.300> chip

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
me just get rid of these the final chip

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.150 
me just get rid of these the final chip
in<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:42.040> series<00:02:42.520> is<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.690> most<00:02:43.720> well<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.800> like

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
in this series is the most well I like

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.750 
in this series is the most well I like
it<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.430> best<00:02:45.460> it's<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.420> vision<00:02:46.810> blocker<00:02:47.230> chip

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it the best it's the vision blocker chip

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.200 
it the best it's the vision blocker chip
now<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.000> chip<00:02:49.890> actually<00:02:50.890> has<00:02:51.130> two<00:02:51.970> methods

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
now this chip actually has two methods

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.730 
now this chip actually has two methods
of<00:02:52.450> operation<00:02:53.190> first<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.390> no<00:02:56.200> collided

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
of operation first with a no collided

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:05.460 
of operation first with a no collided
all<00:02:57.010> drop<00:02:59.130> it<00:03:00.130> will<00:03:02.190> block<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.610> vision<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
all drop it will block the vision of the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.590 
all drop it will block the vision of the
targeted<00:03:06.190> person<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.850> if<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.150> type<00:03:08.010> target

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
targeted person so if I type target

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.190 
targeted person so if I type target
reiner<00:03:10.600> me<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:12.730> will<00:03:12.880> fly<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.870> where<00:03:14.050> I'm

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
reiner me it will fly to where I'm

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.790 
reiner me it will fly to where I'm
looking<00:03:14.820> doesn't<00:03:15.820> matter<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.300> walk<00:03:16.510> around

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
looking doesn't matter if I walk around

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.410 
looking doesn't matter if I walk around
run<00:03:17.800> or<00:03:18.160> jump<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:19.410> cannot<00:03:20.410> see<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:21.820> I<00:03:22.030> try<00:03:22.360> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
run or jump I cannot see if I try and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.930 
run or jump I cannot see if I try and
use<00:03:22.630> my<00:03:22.660> phys<00:03:23.080> gun<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.980> gets<00:03:24.220> stuck<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
use my phys gun it gets stuck on the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.380 
use my phys gun it gets stuck on the
chip<00:03:25.180> now<00:03:26.080> sorry<00:03:26.320> on<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.620> ball<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:28.150> most

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
chip now sorry on the ball and in most

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.750 
chip now sorry on the ball and in most
prop<00:03:28.720> protection<00:03:29.230> servers<00:03:29.710> you<00:03:30.310> would<00:03:30.490> not<00:03:30.610> be

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
prop protection servers you would not be

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.420 
prop protection servers you would not be
able<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.030> use<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.300> phys<00:03:31.510> gun<00:03:31.780> if<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:33.100> try<00:03:33.370> and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
able to use the phys gun if I try and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.500 
able to use the phys gun if I try and
shoot<00:03:33.990> once<00:03:34.990> again<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.950> hits<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.970> prop<00:03:37.240> book

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
shoot once again it hits the prop book

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.320 
shoot once again it hits the prop book
that<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.050> floating<00:03:38.500> around<00:03:38.800> my<00:03:39.100> head<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.300> I

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
that is floating around my head so I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.770 
that is floating around my head so I
can't<00:03:40.660> kill<00:03:40.870> anyone<00:03:41.820> if<00:03:42.820> I<00:03:43.030> try<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.420> use<00:03:43.630> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
can't kill anyone if I try and use the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.040 
can't kill anyone if I try and use the
tool<00:03:44.050> gun<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:45.340> would<00:03:45.610> again<00:03:46.150> create<00:03:46.660> an<00:03:46.840> arrow

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
tool gun it would again create an arrow

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.400 
tool gun it would again create an arrow
with<00:03:47.290> proper<00:03:47.650> tension<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.720> only<00:03:49.900> just

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
with proper tension you can only just

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.880 
with proper tension you can only just
escaped<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:50.950> ball<00:03:51.760> if<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.780> sprint<00:03:53.620> while

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
escaped the ball if you sprint while

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.400 
escaped the ball if you sprint while
flying<00:03:54.190> however<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:54.940> very<00:03:55.000> hard<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:56.380> a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
flying however it's very hard to be a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.940 
flying however it's very hard to be a
minge<00:03:56.770> sprinting<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.790> flying<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.650> that's<00:03:59.830> the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
minge sprinting and flying so that's the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.150 
minge sprinting and flying so that's the
first<00:04:00.280> way<00:04:00.520> you<00:04:00.550> can<00:04:00.760> use<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.620> second

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
first way you can use this the second

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.000 
first way you can use this the second
and<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.820> bit<00:04:04.000> more<00:04:04.030> malicious<00:04:04.510> way<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.320> if<00:04:05.890> you

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and a bit more malicious way is if you

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.240 
and a bit more malicious way is if you
don't<00:04:06.370> know<00:04:06.910> collide<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.870> ball<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.440> then<00:04:09.040> you

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
don't know collide the ball and then you

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.470 
don't know collide the ball and then you
go<00:04:10.140> target<00:04:11.140> for<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.800> know<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:13.450> will<00:04:13.720> always

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
go target for I know it will always

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.200 
go target for I know it will always
start<00:04:16.480> killing<00:04:17.020> that<00:04:17.320> person<00:04:18.030> basically<00:04:19.030> just

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
start killing that person basically just

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.120 
start killing that person basically just
flying<00:04:19.540> towards<00:04:20.049> them<00:04:20.489> until<00:04:21.489> they<00:04:21.640> die

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
flying towards them until they die

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.970 
flying towards them until they die
over<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.970> over<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:27.030> over<00:04:28.030> again<00:04:28.770> so<00:04:29.770> that's

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
over and over and over again so that's

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.700 
over and over and over again so that's
very<00:04:30.340> handy<00:04:30.640> for<00:04:31.000> either<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.420> killing<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.470> minge

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
very handy for either a killing a minge

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.010 
very handy for either a killing a minge
bag<00:04:32.920> who's<00:04:33.220> just<00:04:33.430> pissing<00:04:33.790> everyone<00:04:34.120> off<00:04:34.180> or

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
bag who's just pissing everyone off or

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.090 
bag who's just pissing everyone off or
be<00:04:36.810> being<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.930> minge<00:04:38.140> bag<00:04:38.320> yourself<00:04:38.800> and

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
be being a minge bag yourself and

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.140 
be being a minge bag yourself and
pissing<00:04:39.400> everyone<00:04:39.760> off<00:04:39.820> by<00:04:40.300> killing<00:04:40.690> them<00:04:42.150> so

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
pissing everyone off by killing them so

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.550 
pissing everyone off by killing them so
those<00:04:44.140> are<00:04:44.500> just<00:04:44.530> three<00:04:45.310> of<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:47.020> minge

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
those are just three of the minge
