00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
which is actually massive and it makes

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.870

so I'm gonna try this out against a few

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
so I'm gonna try this out against a few
different<00:01:44.280> bosses<00:01:44.430> first<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:46.380> right

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
different bosses first of all all right

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.810 
different bosses first of all all right
Schafer<00:01:46.680> got<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.950> over<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> weapons<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Schafer got to go over the weapons so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
Schafer got to go over the weapons so
the<00:01:48.270> main<00:01:48.450> weapon<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> you're<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.049> be

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the main weapon that you're going to be

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.330 
the main weapon that you're going to be
doing<00:01:49.229> damage<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> Horseman's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
doing damage with is the Horseman's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.649 
doing damage with is the Horseman's
blade<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.030> actually<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> get

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
blade because you actually have to get

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.490 
blade because you actually have to get
close<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
close up for it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.749 
close up for it
that's<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> Horseman's<00:01:53.490> blade<00:01:53.610> because

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that's not the Horseman's blade because

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.510 
that's not the Horseman's blade because
you<00:01:53.820> actually<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.180> close<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
you actually get close up with it and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.499 
you actually get close up with it and
you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.360> it's

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you can do them and you know it's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.580 
you can do them and you know it's
someone's<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> pumpkin<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.439> does

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
someone's the pumpkin and that does

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709 
someone's the pumpkin and that does
damage<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.700> entire<00:02:00.060> goal<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
damage so the entire goal of this is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.700 
damage so the entire goal of this is
that<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:00.899> gonna<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.259> close<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that you're gonna have to be close up to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.139 
that you're gonna have to be close up to
everyone<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.670> gonna<00:02:02.820> want<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.090> be

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
everyone and you're not gonna want to be

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.209 
everyone and you're not gonna want to be
really<00:02:03.930> avoiding<00:02:04.350> damage<00:02:04.469> because<00:02:04.829> they<00:02:04.950> take

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
really avoiding damage because they take

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.920 
really avoiding damage because they take
all<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> damage<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.600> do

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
all of the damage that you that you do

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.029 
all of the damage that you that you do
so<00:02:07.320> let's<00:02:07.439> actually<00:02:07.500> try<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:08.009> against

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
so let's actually try it out against

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.759 
so let's actually try it out against
Kings<00:02:09.489> slime<00:02:10.860> find<00:02:11.860> out<00:02:11.980> where<00:02:12.159> he<00:02:12.310> went<00:02:13.769> where

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
Kings slime find out where he went where

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.190 
Kings slime find out where he went where
he<00:02:14.890> spawned<00:02:15.250> he's<00:02:16.090> right<00:02:16.269> here<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.989> what<00:02:17.079> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
he spawned he's right here so what you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.809 
he spawned he's right here so what you
do<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:17.439> stay<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.799> middle<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.549> swing

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
do is you stay in the middle you swing

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.780 
do is you stay in the middle you swing
your<00:02:18.969> sword<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:22.269> just<00:02:22.569> destroy<00:02:22.930> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
your sword and you just destroy it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.190 
your sword and you just destroy it
that's<00:02:24.790> that's<00:02:24.969> actually<00:02:25.180> how<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.599> how<00:02:26.079> it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
that's that's actually how the how it

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.960 
that's that's actually how the how it
goes<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.590> one<00:02:27.370> way<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.489> can<00:02:27.640> do<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.939> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
goes and one way you can do it is the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.460 
goes and one way you can do it is the
reason<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.359> like<00:02:28.510> wings<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.079> because<00:02:29.349> if

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
reason I like wings on it is because if

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.929 
reason I like wings on it is because if
you<00:02:29.560> get<00:02:29.650> too<00:02:29.799> low<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.220> can't<00:02:30.459> really<00:02:30.609> take<00:02:30.819> it

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
you get too low you can't really take it

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:31.890 
you get too low you can't really take it
you're<00:02:31.090> not<00:02:31.120> gonna<00:02:31.269> be<00:02:31.359> doing<00:02:31.510> much<00:02:31.629> damage

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you're not gonna be doing much damage

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.660 
you're not gonna be doing much damage
with<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:32.319> you'll<00:02:32.470> heal<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> bit<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.579> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
with it but you'll heal a bit so you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.270 
with it but you'll heal a bit so you
just<00:02:33.879> cut<00:02:34.209> away<00:02:34.299> with<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.930> wings<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.439> you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
just cut away with the wings and you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.770 
just cut away with the wings and you
vamps<00:02:36.849> up<00:02:37.000> until<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.299> fall<00:02:37.450> off<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.659> actually

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
vamps up until you fall off and actually

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.000 
vamps up until you fall off and actually
if<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.049> notice<00:02:38.290> I'm<00:02:38.409> still<00:02:38.439> full<00:02:38.799> health

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
if you notice I'm still full health

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.619 
if you notice I'm still full health
after<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.519> took<00:02:39.579> almost<00:02:39.969> no<00:02:40.150> damage<00:02:40.359> with

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
after that I took almost no damage with

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.750 
after that I took almost no damage with
this<00:02:40.719> setup<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.109> even<00:02:42.040> if<00:02:42.129> I<00:02:42.189> did<00:02:42.340> take<00:02:42.430> damage

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
this setup and even if I did take damage

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.910 
this setup and even if I did take damage
I<00:02:42.879> still<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.510> charm<00:02:44.439> of<00:02:44.530> myths<00:02:44.739> which

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
I still have a charm of myths which

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.410 
I still have a charm of myths which
gives<00:02:45.129> me<00:02:45.220> both<00:02:45.400> life<00:02:45.670> regeneration<00:02:46.299> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
gives me both life regeneration and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.649 
gives me both life regeneration and
cooldown<00:02:47.079> reduction<00:02:47.290> for<00:02:47.980> healing<00:02:48.159> pots<00:02:48.659> so

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
cooldown reduction for healing pots so

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.390 
cooldown reduction for healing pots so
it<00:02:49.780> actually<00:02:50.109> all<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.129> together<00:02:51.340> just

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
it actually all of that together just

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.770 
it actually all of that together just
makes<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.790> massive<00:02:52.090> damage<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.419> this<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.689> what

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
makes it massive damage and this is what

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.390 
makes it massive damage and this is what
I'm<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.019> be<00:02:53.169> using<00:02:53.409> against<00:02:53.859> next<00:02:54.129> time

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
I'm going to be using against next time

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.129 
I'm going to be using against next time

right it is now night and I will try it

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.500 
right it is now night and I will try it
out<00:02:59.560> against<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> eye<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.609> Cthulhu<00:03:00.790> actually

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
out against the eye of Cthulhu actually

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.089 
out against the eye of Cthulhu actually
one<00:03:01.629> thing<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.810> forgot<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.079> to<00:03:02.500> clarify<00:03:02.799> is<00:03:02.919> the

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
one thing I forgot to to clarify is the

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.170 
one thing I forgot to to clarify is the
reason<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.669> take<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.680> bee<00:03:05.680> cloak<00:03:05.950> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
reason that you take the bee cloak and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.339 
reason that you take the bee cloak and

because you don't want anything with a
cross<00:03:10.450> necklace<00:03:10.599> but<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.959> still<00:03:11.230> want<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.379> be

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
cross necklace but you still want to be

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.869 
cross necklace but you still want to be
able<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.620> do<00:03:11.829> damage<00:03:12.010> when<00:03:12.280> you're<00:03:12.400> taking

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
able to do damage when you're taking

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.030 
able to do damage when you're taking
hits<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.569> normally<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.049> take<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.889> one

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
hits so normally you take the the one

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.580 
hits so normally you take the the one
that's<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.280> combination<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.379> star<00:03:17.379> clock

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
that's a combination of the star clock

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.979 
that's a combination of the star clock
and<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.889> clock<00:03:18.010> cross<00:03:18.280> necklace<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.930> it

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
and the clock cross necklace but it

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.000 
and the clock cross necklace but it
makes<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.349> so<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.530> take<00:03:20.620> less<00:03:20.979> damage

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
makes it so you take less damage

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.259 
makes it so you take less damage
actually<00:03:21.519> because<00:03:21.669> you're<00:03:21.760> invulnerable<00:03:21.970> for

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269

double the time and with this build you
actually<00:03:24.729> need<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.180> taking<00:03:25.479> the<00:03:25.569> damage<00:03:25.870> to

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
arranged sometimes and so that but

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:59.279 
arranged sometimes and so that but

that's the twins not actually that hard
with<00:06:09.849> this<00:06:10.030> bill<00:06:10.240> it's<00:06:11.080> in<00:06:11.800> fact<00:06:12.039> it's<00:06:12.189> kind<00:06:12.340> of

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
with this bill it's in fact it's kind of

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.100 
with this bill it's in fact it's kind of
easy<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:13.180> bill<00:06:13.330> it<00:06:13.509> just<00:06:13.689> revolves

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
easy and the bill it just revolves

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.929 
easy and the bill it just revolves
completely<00:06:14.590> around<00:06:14.830> taking<00:06:15.159> the<00:06:15.370> damage<00:06:15.699> and

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
completely around taking the damage and

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.890 
completely around taking the damage and
using<00:06:16.750> that<00:06:16.840> to<00:06:16.900> deal<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.259> damage<00:06:17.379> and<00:06:17.740> again

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
using that to deal the damage and again

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.969 
using that to deal the damage and again
really<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:20.110> don't<00:06:20.229> really<00:06:20.379> need<00:06:20.529> wings<00:06:20.710> for

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
really you don't really need wings for

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.550 
really you don't really need wings for
it<00:06:21.039> but<00:06:21.879> I<00:06:21.909> prefer<00:06:22.240> it<00:06:22.389> this<00:06:22.569> is<00:06:22.779> a<00:06:22.810> situational

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
it but I prefer it this is a situational

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.450 
it but I prefer it this is a situational
I<00:06:23.620> know<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:23.800> you're<00:06:23.889> only<00:06:23.949> gonna<00:06:24.129> wanna<00:06:24.340> use

I know that you're only gonna wanna use

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.010 
I know that you're only gonna wanna use
at<00:06:24.610> night<00:06:24.819> because<00:06:25.029> it<00:06:25.300> does<00:06:25.389> more<00:06:25.509> damage<00:06:25.569> you

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
at night because it does more damage you

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.570 
at night because it does more damage you
should<00:06:26.229> take<00:06:26.349> it<00:06:26.439> warding<00:06:26.740> but<00:06:27.009> I<00:06:27.159> ran<00:06:27.460> out<00:06:27.520> of

should take it warding but I ran out of

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.939 
should take it warding but I ran out of
money<00:06:27.699> actually<00:06:27.909> before<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.389> video<00:06:28.949> all

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949

right so I saved it from being put in
video<00:06:31.750> but<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.169> tried<00:06:32.439> to<00:06:32.469> do<00:06:32.860> pressure<00:06:33.069> on<00:06:33.189> a
