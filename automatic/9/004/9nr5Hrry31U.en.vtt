00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.799
 if you lack adrenaline in life 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.640
 you want to be at the center of the battle not 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.980
 think 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.530
 gather friends and go to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 airsoft ground first question 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 which most often occur in newbies 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.400
 what drive to choose for the game to start 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 determine how seriously you want 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.029
 do this sport fear of pain 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.550
 you can find any type of weapon 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 pistols and machine guns 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.580
 sniper rifle drive selection 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.130
 depends on the role in which you will 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.830
 perform on the field scout sniper 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.110
 attack aircraft gunner destination and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 role can only tell the experience of participation 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.649
 in the game when you already try on 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 various military roles and roles 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.300
 run around the ground with different 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.489
 weapons but whatever the type 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.329
 armament drives are of three types 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.950
 gas springs and 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.690
 electropneumatic most affordable 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.579
 type of pneumatics is a spring drive 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 among its dignity is reliability 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.090
 ease of battery independence 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.489
 and gas reserves 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.500
 as well as his immunity to low 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.550
 temperatures 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.619
 however, the rate of fire is too low 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 severely limits the ability 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.430
 use also we often 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 meet with lovers of the beautiful 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.040
 interior or have a military man in 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.350
 as a gift from army friends 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.119
 the second type is gas drives and gas 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.920
 guns unlike spring they 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 possess more rate of fire but also 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.659
 require special more care such 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090
 the drive will cost you two or even three 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 times more expensive 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 plus add up the cost of each 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.630
 shots as well as buying balls 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 You will also have to have gas and keep in mind that play 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.830
 so drive you only succeed in summer 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.590
 because in the winter gas simply freeze 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.160
 and the last drive type 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.620
 electropneumatic it especially 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.360
 Popular among airsoft here 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.220
 spring action are given no longer 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.540
 man a 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.930
 an electric motor which charges from 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.090
 battery high rate of fire to 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.660
 1000 shots per minute and some 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.580
 rare models even up to 2500 and beautiful 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.260
 range combat makes it unconditional 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.750
 leader among the listed drives 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.760
 however, this species is also sensitive to 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.710
 low temperatures though not so 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.690
 degrees like gas weapons yes and 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.330
 battery in the cold can quickly 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.660
 discharged and fail in unsuitable 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.880
 moment 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.130
 so it is better to start with the budget 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.959
 electric pneumatic drive options 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.820
 well, and then move on to something more 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.770
 serious when you can figure it out 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.770
 what exactly do you need good shopping
