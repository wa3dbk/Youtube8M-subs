gingerly<00:02:46.859> um<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:48.150> wasn't<00:02:48.900> really<00:02:49.200> too<00:02:49.470> fond<00:02:49.799> of

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
gingerly um I wasn't really too fond of

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.479 
gingerly um I wasn't really too fond of
this<00:02:50.129> at<00:02:50.340> first<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.629> then<00:02:51.989> after<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> couple<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
this at first but then after a couple of

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.759 
this at first but then after a couple of
times<00:02:53.730> wearing<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.540> became<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.169> like<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
times wearing it I became to like it and

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.879 
times wearing it I became to like it and
it's<00:02:56.489> kind<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.120> same<00:02:57.359> as<00:02:57.569> Melba<00:02:58.939> but

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
it's kind of the same as Melba but

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's kind of the same as Melba but
darker<00:03:01.889> uh-huh

darker uh-huh

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.949 
darker uh-huh
