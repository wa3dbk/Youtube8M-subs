around<00:01:06.490> until<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.119> cools<00:01:07.450> off<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.930> way<00:01:08.050> it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
around until it cools off that way it

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.710 
around until it cools off that way it
just<00:01:08.200> holds<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.979> bounce<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.940> curl<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.509> lot

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
just holds the bounce and the curl a lot

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.760 
just holds the bounce and the curl a lot
better<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.960> right<00:01:14.170> behind<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.649> do

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770

better and then right behind that I do
another<00:01:15.130> section<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:17.440> forgot<00:01:17.679> to<00:01:17.740> film<00:01:18.160> it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340

sticking<00:01:29.440> up<00:01:29.649> funky<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.340> fixed<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.149> with<00:01:31.450> a

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
sticking up funky I fixed that with a

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.029 
sticking up funky I fixed that with a
straightener<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.080> just<00:01:32.259> forgot<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.560> film<00:01:32.890> it

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
straightener I just forgot to film it

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.370

but<00:01:33.369> after<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.330> curl<00:01:34.659> all<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.020> hair<00:01:35.200> that's

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
but after I curl all the hair that's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.350 
but after I curl all the hair that's
what<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.619> do<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.280> wrap<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.789> around<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.090> wand

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
what I do so wrap it around the wand

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.290 
what I do so wrap it around the wand
away<00:01:37.780> from<00:01:38.200> my<00:01:38.350> face<00:01:38.819> hold<00:01:39.819> it<00:01:39.970> for<00:01:40.210> about

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
away from my face hold it for about

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.600 
away from my face hold it for about
eight<00:01:40.630> seconds<00:01:41.880> let<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.000> fall<00:01:43.179> down<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:45.100> grab

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
eight seconds let it fall down then grab

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.399 
eight seconds let it fall down then grab
it<00:01:45.640> up<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.030> my<00:01:46.149> hand<00:01:46.390> bounce<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.930> around<00:01:47.020> until

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.130 
it up in my hand bounce it around until
it<00:01:47.680> cools<00:01:47.979> off<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.369> then<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.240> nice<00:01:52.420> curl

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
it cools off and then it's a nice curl

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.380 
it cools off and then it's a nice curl
like<00:01:53.829> this<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.549> then<00:01:54.820> I'm<00:01:55.030> just<00:01:55.119> going<00:01:55.299> to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
like this and then I'm just going to

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.999 
like this and then I'm just going to
speed<00:01:55.689> up<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.869> rest<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.469> so<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.860> goes

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
speed up the rest of it so it goes

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.440 
speed up the rest of it so it goes
quicker

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:16.130

you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.950> see<00:02:17.190> as<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.580> get<00:02:17.790> further<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.080> back

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you can see as I get further to the back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.890 
you can see as I get further to the back
of<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.530> head<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.890> start<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.220> put<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:20.490> arm<00:02:20.900> behind

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
of my head I start to put my arm behind

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.920 
of my head I start to put my arm behind
my<00:02:22.260> head<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.010> easier<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:24.150> control<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
my head it's just easier to control the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
my head it's just easier to control the
wand<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.530> way<00:02:25.770> instead<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.520> trying<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.850> hold

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
wand that way instead of trying to hold

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
wand that way instead of trying to hold
it<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.300> front<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.720> face<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.440> just

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
it in the front of your face it's just

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.430 
it in the front of your face it's just
awkward<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.000> try<00:02:30.360> putting<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.959> behind<00:02:31.080> your

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
awkward so try putting it behind your

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.310 
awkward so try putting it behind your
head<00:02:32.280> you'll<00:02:32.940> burn<00:02:33.240> your<00:02:33.390> hand<00:02:33.660> every<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
head you'll burn your hand every now and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.990 
head you'll burn your hand every now and
then<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:34.650> you'll<00:02:34.950> you'll<00:02:35.370> get<00:02:35.550> better<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
then but you'll you'll get better at it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.970 
then but you'll you'll get better at it
so<00:02:36.959> that's<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.320> looks<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.620> after<00:02:37.830> it's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
so that's what it looks like after it's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
so that's what it looks like after it's
all<00:02:38.190> curled<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.850> I'm<00:02:39.600> going<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> other

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.820 
all curled and I'm going to do the other
side<00:02:40.440> off<00:02:40.770> camera

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.240 

and<00:02:44.700> then<00:02:45.270> once<00:02:45.510> both<00:02:45.870> sides<00:02:46.260> are<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:46.620> curled

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and then once both sides are all curled

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.610 
and then once both sides are all curled
