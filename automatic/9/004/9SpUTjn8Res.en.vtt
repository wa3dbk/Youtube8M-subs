be a separate program like lime snow is
i'll<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> second<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.320> going

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
i'll get to that in a second it's going

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.480 
i'll get to that in a second it's going
to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> complete<00:01:26.159> program<00:01:28.159> it's<00:01:29.159> gonna<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to be a complete program it's gonna be a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
to be a complete program it's gonna be a
basically<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> complete<00:01:30.240> program<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
basically a complete program that it's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.319 
basically a complete program that it's
just<00:01:32.070> going<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.369> added<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> cydia<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
just going to be added on to cydia and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
just going to be added on to cydia and
you<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> add<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> source<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.680> will<00:01:34.770> be

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you have to add a source and it will be
