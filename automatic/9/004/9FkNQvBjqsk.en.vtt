00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.530
 planet silencers 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.560
 The planet of silencers suggest the following 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.320
 repair service 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.230
 repair and replacement of the resonator repair and 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.830
 replacement silencers 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 replacement of corrugated lash repair and 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 catalyst replacement 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.610
 Installation of flame arresters manufacture 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 receiving tubes 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.940
 repair exhaust manifold tuning 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.940
 exhaust systems 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.589
 repair resonators 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.010
 and installing a flame arrester instead 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.300
 malfunctioning catalysts on a car 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.300
 Daewoo Nexia 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.950
 catalyst resonator and connective 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.850
 trumpet 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.320
 will be replaced will be installed new 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.210
 resonator connecting another instead 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.550
 catalyst will be installed 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:33.610
 flame arrester removed sensor lambda 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:41.130
 probe from the exhaust system cut out 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.130
 old catalyst and extract 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:56.149
 exhaust system is cut in front 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 rear cans of a car muffler 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.490
 remove the old resonator connect and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.899
 round for installation prepare new 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:15.209
 the resonator is cut off the flange from it 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:17.600
 mounts try on a small resonator for 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.920
 installations 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.920
 made a small repair pipe 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.840
 pipes cut a hole for 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:44.160
 nut fitting 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:46.739
 lambda probe new resonator 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.280
 connecting pipe set on 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.280
 regular place 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.360
 pipe 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:03.590
 secured by welding on the back banks 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:06.670
 the muffler boils down the nut 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.670
 lambda probe 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.330
 flame arrester are installed and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.990
 reunion with exhaust pipe 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.990
 scald 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:31.430
 then roll the flame arrester connection 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:34.880
 with pipe resonators connecting pipe 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.960
 rear cans of the muffler also fail 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.700
 welding places 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.700
 paint heat resistant paints 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.750
 so installed a flame arrester and a new 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.450
 resonator and connecting pipe repair 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.990
 is over 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.280

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:04.310
 installed accessories a year and a half 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.500
 time waiting for the end of the repair you 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.140
 can spend specially equipped 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.490
 here you can see the room 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.490
 additional information and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.510
 assortment of components
