00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
hey guys Tyson here with kicker

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.280 
hey guys Tyson here with kicker
technical<00:00:08.820> support<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.780> we're<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.080> do

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
technical support what we're going to do

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.890 
technical support what we're going to do
today<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.889> we're<00:00:11.280> going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.429> wire<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.910> eight<00:00:12.450> of

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
today is we're going to wire up eight of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.919 
today is we're going to wire up eight of
our<00:00:13.410> ten<00:00:13.710> inch<00:00:13.920> single<00:00:14.820> boy<00:00:15.089> school<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.780> ohm

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
our ten inch single boy school for ohm

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.550 
our ten inch single boy school for ohm
subs

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
subs

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.800 
subs
we'll<00:00:17.490> break<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.820> down<00:00:17.850> into<00:00:18.150> pairs<00:00:18.449> put<00:00:18.720> them

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we'll break it down into pairs put them

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.150 
we'll break it down into pairs put them
in<00:00:18.930> groups<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.680> side<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.039> be

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
in groups so this side would be

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460 
in groups so this side would be
paralleled<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:21.420> side<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.869> paralleled

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
paralleled this side will be paralleled

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
paralleled this side will be paralleled
and<00:00:22.680> will<00:00:23.100> series<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> before<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> amplifier

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and will series it before the amplifier

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269 
and will series it before the amplifier
so<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> break<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.470> down<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.010> works

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
so to break that down the way it works

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.330 
so to break that down the way it works
out<00:00:26.460> here's<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:28.279> go<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
out here's what we're going to do go to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.800 
out here's what we're going to do go to
the<00:00:29.460> bottom<00:00:29.609> side<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.970> each<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> our<00:00:30.510> subs

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the bottom side of each of our subs

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.350 
the bottom side of each of our subs
we're<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.189> positive<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.300> one

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
we're going to have one positive and one

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520 
we're going to have one positive and one
negative<00:00:33.829> single<00:00:34.829> voice<00:00:34.920> coil<00:00:35.280> subs<00:00:36.530> need

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
negative single voice coil subs need

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.160 
negative single voice coil subs need
some<00:00:37.739> jumper<00:00:38.070> wire<00:00:38.629> basically<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.840> woofer

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
some jumper wire basically from woofer

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.580 
some jumper wire basically from woofer
the<00:00:40.200> woofer<00:00:40.969> we<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.480> connect<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the woofer we will want to connect the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.310 
the woofer we will want to connect the
negatives<00:00:44.070> together<00:00:45.050> throughout<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.230> setup

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
negatives together throughout the setup

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
negatives together throughout the setup
and<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.500> our<00:00:49.620> positives<00:00:50.190> throughout<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and then our positives throughout the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
and then our positives throughout the
setup<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.079> negatives<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
setup so all your negatives will be

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.420 
setup so all your negatives will be
connected<00:00:57.469> then<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.890> positives

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
connected then all of your positives

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.969 
connected then all of your positives
will<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.699> connected<00:01:03.559> basically<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.739> going

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
will be connected basically just going

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.120 
will be connected basically just going
all<00:01:05.790> negatives<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:09.530> then<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:10.650> start<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.010> my

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
all negatives here then I'll start on my

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.270 
all negatives here then I'll start on my
positives

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.860 

sure<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.670> wires<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.240> there<00:01:21.659> nice

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
sure you get your wires in there nice

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.930 
sure you get your wires in there nice
and<00:01:22.110> clean<00:01:22.380> don't<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.369> anything<00:01:23.610> really

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
and clean don't have anything really

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.010 
and clean don't have anything really
hanging<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:24.690> it's<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> be

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hanging out where it's going to be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190 
hanging out where it's going to be
hitting<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> basket<00:01:25.970> or<00:01:26.970> grounding<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.020> on

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
hitting the basket or grounding out on

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.880 
hitting the basket or grounding out on
anything<00:01:30.650> get<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.920> tight<00:01:32.160> in<00:01:32.340> there

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
anything get a little tight in there

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.850 
anything get a little tight in there
okay<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:36.540> side<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:36.990> did<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.440> parallel

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
okay this side we just did in parallel

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
okay this side we just did in parallel
I've<00:01:38.070> already<00:01:38.340> done<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.759> side<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.390> save

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I've already done this side just to save

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.170 
I've already done this side just to save
time<00:01:39.770> basically<00:01:40.770> same<00:01:41.159> thing<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.940> Reds

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
time basically same thing all my Reds

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
time basically same thing all my Reds
connect<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.690> together<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.400> blacks

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
connect it together and all my blacks

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.990 
connect it together and all my blacks
all<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> negatives<00:01:45.390> connected<00:01:45.780> together

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
all the negatives connected together

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.190 
all the negatives connected together
this<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.479> my<00:01:48.600> lead<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.080> the
