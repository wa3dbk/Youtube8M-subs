 [Applause] 

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.610
 by the way today we are going to stamp t-shirts 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.080
 with chlorine 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 [Music] 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.640
 [Applause] 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.020
 hello everyone in hello everyone in the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.290
 today's video we are going to do workshops 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.300
 stamped with chlorine that for this video 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.850
 We are going to need a cotton shirt 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.960
 smooth of some dark color and also a 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.090
 important element that we are going to 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.579
 need is paper for freezer this 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.040
 paper on one side has a layer a layer 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.960
 plastic eye is not waxed paper if not 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.850
 they find they can use plastic 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.160
 self-adhesive and it will work in a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.750
 similar we will need an atomizer and a 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 little domestic chlorine we're also going to 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.530
 need the printing or design that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.270
 you want an exact 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.720
 trim well let's cut a piece 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.400
 of the paper for the freezer 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.350
 and we are going to place it with plastic 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.670
 looking down and we're going to draw the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.670
 outline of our design 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.120
 and since we have our design we're going 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.860
 to cut out with the help of an exact 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.210
 remember not to throw all the pieces 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.240
 because some of us are going to use them more 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.909
 ahead 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.950
 according to the design once we have 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.840
 our design we are going to get a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.790
 piece of cardboard like this that fits 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.070
 inside our shirt and we put the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.470
 cardboard to our shirt now we place 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.450
 our design on the shirt and 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.229
 We put all your pieces and with the help of 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.990
 the iron is fixed in its place and that 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.909
 are well attached and we repeat this with 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
 the other pieces that are needed 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.630
 our design the paper is used 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.850
 self-adhesive only should 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.220
 paste it do not iron it and now we're going to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.729
 take our atomizer and we're going to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.979
 Fill with water and with 50% chlorine in 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.220
 this case I put my half cup of chlorine and 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.830
 half a cup of water 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 we must make sure that no part of 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.420
 the shirt is exposed in case 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.270
 splash the chlorine we need to have 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 paper at hand and preferably use 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.410
 gloves and now we're just going to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.610
 spray some of our water with chlorine 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.149
 about the design 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.429
 [Music] 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.429
 just a little bit says changes 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.260
 and you can immediately see that the color 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.480
 Gray has changed and if they wish they can 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.740
 add a little more chlorine and dry it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.130
 well and once you have the color that 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.450
 we want to remove the paper 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.879
 [Music] 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 and they're going to have an impression like this and 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.420
 after this I recommend that the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 rinse with plenty of water if you wish 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.890
 you can get creative and do it to the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.610
 inverse 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.650
 and using very little chlorine 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.920
 [Music] 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.950
 can have this design or can have 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.930
 this other and that's it, that's the easy way 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.880
 to make a shirt with a bit of 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.860
 chlorine can do the design they want 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.660
 and depending on the amount of chlorine that 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.580
 add they can make different 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.650
 degraded on the web you know if you
