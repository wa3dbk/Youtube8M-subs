knife<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> perfect<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.990> net<00:01:22.200> carry<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
knife is perfect for net carry so I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
knife is perfect for net carry so I
would<00:01:25.560> suggest<00:01:25.770> maybe<00:01:26.250> throwing<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.150> Kydex

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
would suggest maybe throwing a Kydex

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.289 
would suggest maybe throwing a Kydex
sheath<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.590> similar<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> msk<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
sheath on there similar to the msk and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.920 
sheath on there similar to the msk and
it'd<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.460> perfect<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> lot<00:01:33.720> better

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it'd be perfect like this a lot better

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.249 
it'd be perfect like this a lot better
than<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.799> leather<00:01:34.979> sheath<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.640> anyway

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
than the leather sheath but anyway

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
than the leather sheath but anyway

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the lighter color micarta this may not

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.859

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
micarta and I saw this stuff about

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
micarta and I saw this stuff about
scrubbing<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.500> toothbrushes<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.200 

actually<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.800> bit<00:03:46.980> easier<00:03:47.520> if<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.150> are

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
actually a little bit easier if you are

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.600 
actually a little bit easier if you are
using<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.050> kitchen<00:03:49.260> sink<00:03:49.740> but<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.280> kitchen

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
using the kitchen sink but the kitchen

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.050 
using the kitchen sink but the kitchen
sink<00:03:50.640> does<00:03:51.120> not<00:03:51.270> exactly<00:03:51.630> make<00:03:52.020> for<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:53.060> good

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
sink does not exactly make for a good

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:05.490 
sink does not exactly make for a good
video<00:03:54.330> environment

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.650 

so<00:04:05.980> that's<00:04:06.460> just<00:04:06.820> about<00:04:07.000> do<00:04:07.240> it<00:04:07.330> right<00:04:07.540> there

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
so that's just about do it right there

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:22.260 
so that's just about do it right there

out especially out here in the Sun but
look<00:04:42.180> at<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.419> difference<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> handle<00:04:43.349> now

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
look at the difference in the handle now

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.070 
look at the difference in the handle now
compared<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:43.979> where<00:04:44.159> we<00:04:44.280> started<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.930> can

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
compared to where we started you can

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.070 
compared to where we started you can
really<00:04:46.680> see<00:04:47.009> it<00:04:48.000> brings<00:04:48.449> when<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.840> get<00:04:49.050> a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
really see it brings when you get a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.070 
really see it brings when you get a
scrub<00:04:49.800> all<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.219> dirt<00:04:50.909> and<00:04:51.090> oil<00:04:51.330> out<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.810> the

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
micarta it really brings out the pattern

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.700 
micarta it really brings out the pattern
in<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> micarta<00:04:56.879> and<00:04:57.590> if<00:04:58.590> you've<00:04:58.770> watched<00:04:59.310> my

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
you watched my original scandi trekker

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.939 
you watched my original scandi trekker
video<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.940> didn't<00:05:09.419> look<00:05:10.050> anything<00:05:10.379> like<00:05:10.560> this
