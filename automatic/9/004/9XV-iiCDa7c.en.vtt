was<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> Droid<00:00:14.309> 3<00:00:14.549> since<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> video<00:00:15.480> came<00:00:15.690> out

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
was the Droid 3 since the video came out

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
was the Droid 3 since the video came out
and<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.650> there<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.160> been<00:00:17.220> some<00:00:17.580> problems

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and now there have been some problems

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.480 
and now there have been some problems
with<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> Droid<00:00:18.449> 3<00:00:18.690> software<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.310> phone

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.279 
with the Droid 3 software and the phone
itself<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.210> figured<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.570> would<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:21.930> update

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
itself so I figured I would do an update

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.259 
itself so I figured I would do an update
video<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> let<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.039> guys<00:00:23.070> know<00:00:23.430> some<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
one of the biggest problems was probably

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.080 
one of the biggest problems was probably
the<00:00:31.380> fact<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> people<00:00:32.130> were<00:00:32.279> experiencing<00:00:32.910> a

lot<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> headaches<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> motoblur<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
lot of headaches with the motoblur and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.310 
lot of headaches with the motoblur and
the<00:00:35.910> time<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> did<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> review<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.140> not

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

experiencing<00:00:37.920> any<00:00:38.100> problems<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.700> motoblur

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
experiencing any problems with motoblur

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
experiencing any problems with motoblur
it<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.450> running<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.899> fine<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.739> wasn't

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it was running just fine they wasn't

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
it was running just fine they wasn't
acting<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.450> fast<00:00:42.719> fluid<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
acting up it was pretty fast fluid and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.310 
acting up it was pretty fast fluid and
responsive<00:00:43.640> but<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.239> motoblur<00:00:45.930> became

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
responsive but over time motoblur became

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
responsive but over time motoblur became
much<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:47.010> unreliable<00:00:47.820> my<00:00:48.149> phone<00:00:48.360> would

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
much more unreliable my phone would

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
much more unreliable my phone would
actually<00:00:48.870> freeze<00:00:49.260> lock<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:50.070> swiping<00:00:50.760> back<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
actually freeze lock up swiping back and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.520 
actually freeze lock up swiping back and
forth<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.449> would<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> swipe<00:00:52.079> multiple

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
forth I would have to swipe multiple

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
forth I would have to swipe multiple
times<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> next<00:00:53.730> frame<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
times just to get to the next frame and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
times just to get to the next frame and
my<00:00:54.449> phone<00:00:54.750> would<00:00:54.989> actually<00:00:55.320> shut<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
my phone would actually shut down and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010 
my phone would actually shut down and
restart<00:00:56.579> itself<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:57.629> droid

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
restart itself much like my droid

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
restart itself much like my droid
