do the tap thing I don't know if they've

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.020 
do the tap thing I don't know if they've
done<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.590> yet<00:02:11.769> or<00:02:12.190> if<00:02:12.340> they're<00:02:12.489> still<00:02:12.670> doing<00:02:12.790> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
but either way the MetroCard can sit in

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.310 
but either way the MetroCard can sit in
there<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:16.180> course<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.110> swipe

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
there of course this you have to swipe

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.289 
there of course this you have to swipe
so<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.680> would<00:02:17.799> have<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.040> take<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:18.459> swipe

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.410 
so you would have to take it out swipe
it<00:02:19.510> put<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.470> back<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.940> little<00:02:22.150> bit<00:02:22.239> more

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
it put it back in it's a little bit more

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.729 
it put it back in it's a little bit more
of<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.570> pain<00:02:22.750> than<00:02:22.989> if<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> tap<00:02:23.500> card

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
of a pain than if you have a tap card

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.770 
of a pain than if you have a tap card
but<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.549> New<00:02:24.730> York<00:02:24.760> has<00:02:25.060> done<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.330> tap<00:02:25.510> card

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
but if New York has done the tap card

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.750 
but if New York has done the tap card
then<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.140> same<00:02:26.320> deals<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.739> LA<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.190> can't

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
that they've incorporated a Power

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.320 
that they've incorporated a Power
Rangers<00:02:32.680> thing<00:02:32.890> into<00:02:33.220> everyday<00:02:33.610> real-life

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
Rangers thing into everyday real-life

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.060 
Rangers thing into everyday real-life
use<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.840> wish<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.170> didn't<00:02:35.410> slide<00:02:35.590> out<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:35.890> easily

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
use I wish I didn't slide out so easily

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.590 
use I wish I didn't slide out so easily
and<00:02:36.549> I<00:02:36.670> kind<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:36.910> wish<00:02:37.030> there<00:02:37.209> was<00:02:37.329> something

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and I kind of wish there was something

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.000 
and I kind of wish there was something
on<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> back<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.530> think<00:02:38.709> they<00:02:38.799> could<00:02:38.980> have

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
on the back and I think they could have

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.500 
on the back and I think they could have
kind<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.310> done<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.610> differently<00:02:40.060> somehow

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
kind of done this differently somehow

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.940 
kind of done this differently somehow
I'm<00:02:40.690> not<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:40.959> sure<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> would<00:02:41.709> suggest

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
I'm not really sure what I would suggest

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.100 
I'm not really sure what I would suggest
they<00:02:42.340> did<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:43.000> both<00:02:43.269> really<00:02:43.600> liked<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
they did but I both really liked it and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.289 
they did but I both really liked it and
think<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.350> could<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.560> been<00:02:44.680> better<00:02:44.829> I<00:02:45.299> would

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
think it could have been better I would

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.789 
think it could have been better I would
especially<00:02:46.480> recommend<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.470> younger
