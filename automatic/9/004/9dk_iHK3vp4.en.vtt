was your favorite I can't choose from

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280 
was your favorite I can't choose from
castle<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:25.240> Carnival<00:02:26.240> my<00:02:26.750> favorite<00:02:27.140> was<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
castle or Carnival my favorite was the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.540 
castle or Carnival my favorite was the
boat<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.190> was<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.370> most

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
boat because that was the most

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.800 
boat because that was the most
challenging<00:02:28.760> mystery<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.510> was<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
challenging mystery and that was the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.660 
challenging mystery and that was the
third<00:02:29.990> case<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.560> one<00:02:30.890> he<00:02:31.010> actually<00:02:31.310> kind<00:02:31.580> of

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
third case that one he actually kind of

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.920 
third case that one he actually kind of
had<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.910> think<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.420> rest<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.630> them<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.840> could

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
had to think the rest of them you could

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.970 
had to think the rest of them you could
pretty<00:02:33.110> much<00:02:33.230> figure<00:02:33.470> out<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.830> very

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
pretty much figure out from the very

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.590 
pretty much figure out from the very
first<00:02:34.160> clue<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.970> let's<00:02:35.240> talking<00:02:35.420> about<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
first clue so let's talking about the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.240 
first clue so let's talking about the
gameplay<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.500> already<00:02:36.770> said<00:02:36.890> it's<00:02:37.040> just<00:02:37.070> like

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
gameplay we already said it's just like

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.140 
gameplay we already said it's just like
the<00:02:37.430> Lego<00:02:37.580> games

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the Lego games

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.699 
the Lego games
well<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.540> can't<00:02:38.780> die<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.620> to

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
well you can't die and you have to

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.710 
well you can't die and you have to
despite<00:02:40.100> random<00:02:40.580> creatures<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.360> solve

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
despite random creatures and solve

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.540 
despite random creatures and solve
puzzles<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.709> two-player<00:02:43.220> cooperative

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
puzzles this is a two-player cooperative

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.020 
puzzles this is a two-player cooperative
game<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.330> played<00:02:44.569> together<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.200> whole<00:02:45.290> time

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
game we played together the whole time

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.370 
game we played together the whole time
and<00:02:47.030> most<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.510> levels<00:02:47.810> there's<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.020> clue<00:02:48.230> to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and most of the levels there's a clue to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.229 
and most of the levels there's a clue to
find<00:02:48.620> there<00:02:48.950> are<00:02:49.070> trophies<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.730> costumes

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
find there are trophies and costumes

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.760 
find there are trophies and costumes
also<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.020> there<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.350> little<00:02:51.500> bit<00:02:51.680> of

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
also so there is a little bit of

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.500 
also so there is a little bit of
replayability<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.760> want<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.060> find<00:02:53.269> those

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
replayability if you want to find those

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.570 
replayability if you want to find those
items<00:02:53.720> almost<00:02:54.560> all<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.860> cases<00:02:55.010> except<00:02:55.489> the

minutes or chapter in each of the cases
there's<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.250> chase<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.850> have<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.060> go

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.380 
through where the monster is chasing you
it's<00:03:07.160> where<00:03:07.400> you're<00:03:07.519> running<00:03:07.670> at<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> screen

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
it's where you're running at the screen

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.030

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
and you have to constantly keep jumping

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.100 
and you have to constantly keep jumping
to<00:03:10.310> stay<00:03:10.519> ahead<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> monster<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.720> bosses

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
to stay ahead of the monster the bosses

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.780 
to stay ahead of the monster the bosses
that<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.350> thought<00:03:12.530> were<00:03:12.709> multi-part<00:03:13.370> battles

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that you thought were multi-part battles

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.030 
that you thought were multi-part battles
but<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.330> were<00:03:14.390> always<00:03:14.780> very<00:03:15.110> easy

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
but they were always very easy

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.620 
but they were always very easy
maybe<00:03:16.459> that's<00:03:16.700> due<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.030> fact<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.450> you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
maybe that's due to the fact that you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.600 
maybe that's due to the fact that you
can't<00:03:17.930> die<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.530> game<00:03:18.830> they<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.430> keep

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
they show you the suspects that could be

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.150

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.569 
which one you think it is but it really
doesn't<00:03:27.200> matter<00:03:27.350> who<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.799> choose<00:03:27.829> as<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
ending will always be the same but it's

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.840 
ending will always be the same but it's
still<00:03:30.410> nice<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.620> have<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.010> little<00:03:31.160> extra<00:03:31.430> if

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
probably a good move maybe put it added

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
your special attack is you would use a
