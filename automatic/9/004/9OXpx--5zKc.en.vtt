power<00:03:24.640> adapters<00:03:25.120> now<00:03:25.960> one<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.320> drawbacks

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
power adapters now one of the drawbacks

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.450

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
from the when it comes to the new power

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.880 
from the when it comes to the new power
adapters<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.240> loses<00:03:31.630> its<00:03:31.890> on

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
adapters that it loses its on

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.840 
adapters that it loses its on
international<00:03:33.760> use<00:03:34.720> as<00:03:34.960> in<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.010> old<00:03:36.280> power

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
international use as in in the old power

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.430 
international use as in in the old power
adapter<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.420> can<00:03:37.480> always<00:03:37.690> take<00:03:38.080> out<00:03:38.200> that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
adapter you can always take out that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.980 
adapter you can always take out that
small<00:03:39.130> slider<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.700> insert<00:03:40.060> your<00:03:40.240> own<00:03:40.480> power

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
small slider and insert your own power

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.300 
small slider and insert your own power
adapter<00:03:41.260> depending<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:41.920> which<00:03:42.070> country

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
adapter depending on which country

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.270 
adapter depending on which country
you're<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:42.730> but<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.660> figured<00:03:44.080> they<00:03:44.230> fix<00:03:45.010> that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
you're in but I figured they fix that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.430 
you're in but I figured they fix that
with<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.670> new<00:03:45.940> iPhones<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:46.930> they<00:03:47.230> come

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
with the new iPhones because they come

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.550 
with the new iPhones because they come
up<00:03:47.530> with<00:03:47.620> their<00:03:47.800> own<00:03:47.980> power<00:03:48.850> adapters<00:03:49.390> on<00:03:50.230> off

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
up with their own power adapters on off

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.400 
up with their own power adapters on off
it's<00:03:50.740> much<00:03:50.920> greener<00:03:51.220> or<00:03:51.580> whatnot<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:52.330> kind<00:03:53.320> of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
it's much greener or whatnot but kind of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.449 
it's much greener or whatnot but kind of
an<00:03:53.500> effect<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:56.500> um<00:03:57.180> yeah

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
an effect but um yeah

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.709 
an effect but um yeah

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:02.719 
so now I'm going to look at the iPhone

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.140 
so now I'm going to look at the iPhone
I'm<00:04:03.719> going<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.930> turn<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.700> as<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:05.879> see

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
here the LCD screen has some kind of a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.369 
here the LCD screen has some kind of a
backlight<00:04:10.519> problems<00:04:11.519> but<00:04:12.299> nothing<00:04:12.450> too<00:04:12.840> bad<00:04:13.049> I

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
backlight problems but nothing too bad I

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.300 
backlight problems but nothing too bad I
can<00:04:13.560> still<00:04:13.769> use<00:04:13.920> it

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
can still use it

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.939 
can still use it
touch<00:04:15.060> screen<00:04:15.359> still<00:04:15.540> works<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.620> I'm<00:04:16.709> looking

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
touch screen still works and I'm looking

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.490 
touch screen still works and I'm looking
at<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.220> chrome<00:04:17.729> side<00:04:18.000> see<00:04:18.930> additional

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
at the chrome side see additional

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.820 
at the chrome side see additional
scratches<00:04:19.949> as<00:04:20.100> well<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:24.530> kind<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.590> felt<00:04:25.800> a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
scratches as well and kind of felt a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.170 
scratches as well and kind of felt a
little<00:04:25.860> bit<00:04:26.100> bulky<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:26.729> think<00:04:27.000> that's

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
little bit bulky but I think that's

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.850 
little bit bulky but I think that's
because<00:04:27.449> they've<00:04:27.630> been<00:04:27.660> used<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:28.350> my<00:04:28.560> ipod

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
because they've been used to my ipod

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.600 
because they've been used to my ipod
touch<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.460> my<00:04:29.490> iPhone<00:04:30.030> 4<00:04:30.650> but<00:04:31.699> pretty<00:04:32.699> neat<00:04:34.610> but

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
touch in my iPhone 4 but pretty neat but

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.790 
touch in my iPhone 4 but pretty neat but
uh<00:04:35.669> we're<00:04:36.389> going<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:36.570> wait<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> iPhone<00:04:37.560> to

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
uh we're going to wait for the iPhone to

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.529 
uh we're going to wait for the iPhone to
boot<00:04:38.099> up<00:04:38.130> as<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.520> can<00:04:38.610> see<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.090> says<00:04:39.330> the

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
boot up as you can see that it says the

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.439 
boot up as you can see that it says the
no<00:04:39.840> SIM<00:04:40.110> card<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:41.160> found<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:41.789> it's<00:04:42.030> required

that<00:04:46.259> little<00:04:47.539> everything<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.110> find<00:04:49.349> that

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
that little everything and I find that

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.839 
that little everything and I find that
it's<00:04:49.560> running<00:04:49.919> on<00:04:49.979> three<00:04:50.190> point<00:04:50.490> one<00:04:50.669> point

two<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.919> I<00:04:52.919> guess<00:04:53.099> that's<00:04:53.310> why<00:04:53.460> it's<00:04:53.639> very

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
two and I guess that's why it's very

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.930 
two and I guess that's why it's very
slow<00:04:54.599> so<00:04:55.050> I'm<00:04:55.110> mom<00:04:55.590> tried<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:55.949> downgrade<00:04:56.610> it

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940
