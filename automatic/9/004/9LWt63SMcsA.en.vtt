00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 Today we show the new NASA 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.070
 helicopter so one 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.599
 stabilization system for helicopters with 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.820
 the meat all tax system goes too 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.789
 of course also for pater systems and 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.329
 additionally the functionality with 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:35.350
 gps so we have the Freibades mode 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.990
 for 3d fly with optional henning 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 picks up office or normal stabilized 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:46.450
 Heck then we have as a second mode 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.610
 switchable during the flight automatically 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.560
 stabilization we see here through the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 LED in automatic stabilization 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.900
 we see that the deaf slice always 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.450
 After is regulated by the helicopter 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.820
 just to keep in the current situation 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.490
 we also have a storage control 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.670
 that is when we roll for example 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.740
 to give then he goes into one 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.690
 however, there is a certain inclination 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.370
 while we keep the stick when we are 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.110
 he goes back with the cliff 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.030
 back to the horizontal position, then 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.300
 ideal for beginners and beginners 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.560
 the third mode is when the gps 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.170
 signal the gps module I adopted 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.200
 is is an optional module is 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.110
 by default it can not be 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.630
 helicopter just hold the position and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.549
 then be flown by gps and 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 once the cliff is released 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.830
 he automatically holds the position and the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.830
 let's just show it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.520
 the helicopter is started in 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.820
 Manual mode and you start them 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.350
 set it on a few meters height just 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.250
 out of the ground effect and 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.170
 next gps mode or you activate 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 the breath mode for stabilization 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.220
 the remaining functions work 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.220
 just like the helicopter so we 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.740
 and also here at the notary by the great 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.320
 is a 14th 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.480
 the rodents control in the camp of the mode 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.250
 for that would be for this stop 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.250
 on 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.040
 Now you can control the helicopter 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.189
 let fly the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:43.450
 but is quite used to how others stay 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:46.090
 the system too so I bring now 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.490
 again a bit almost ours and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.450
 switch now in flight 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.350
 also the stabilization mode with gps 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.690
 So the second mode is activated 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.730
 and I say now 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.730
 Taxes available 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.170
 who would have 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.380
 Now I can drive with the stick 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.820
 So I really just have to be the next one 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.870
 platform is really a helicopter 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.940
 to move forward 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.050
 I'm not going away in that case 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.580
 helicopter but the gps position 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.140
 and the helicopter is automatic 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.140
 you can fall back again 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.520
 so white emergency shown 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.170
 and gave up for the beginning is ideal 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 to make flights 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.000
 via the integrated parametric 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.990
 the heli always keeps her hello 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 current altitude 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.300
 if that does not change 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.010
 that is independent of the woman with 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.520
 Slice interference in the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.520
 remote control that is in the 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.000
 stabilization fund takes over the nose 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.470
 H 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.610
 the eye control on all functions 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.980
 and if I just get a situation where 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.540
 I do not remember how the helicopter 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.700
 I just leave the sticks 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.180
 just let go and he will stay at the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.710
 position simply stand can it 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 then slowly bring back so 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.180
 to practice to maintain ideal helicopter 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.460
 but also fly faster then 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.340
 needs much more rash 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.880
 as in manual mode where he is 3d capable 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.440
 would 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.940
 in the meat of the mode so here is full 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:11.110
 Rash angle of about 45 degrees more 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.110
 then the helicopter does not do 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.340
 I have the helicopter very tame 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.230
 adjusted what the speed is because 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.020
 I just now in this video no 3d 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:38.129
 show flight here you can see how 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.089
 precise the position 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.089
 keep the but works 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:50.960
 So I have no control 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.100
 do not control or fix anything in front of you 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.080
 so land 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.390
 just go back to manual mode 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.650
 go back and 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.650
 go down slowly 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:15.870
 and turn off the main engine again 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:19.620
 Attached LED rear also serves as the battery 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.110
 monitoring and you can in nasa has on 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.930
 computer then the under voltage warning 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.780
 activate from which voltage enter 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:33.199
 left first orange later a red one 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.199
 blinking when discharging the battery wall
