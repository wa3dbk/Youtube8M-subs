00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
tutorials com in this video we're going

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.669 
tutorials com in this video we're going
to<00:00:08.700> learn<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> create<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.690> realistic<00:00:10.230> water

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
to learn how to create a realistic water

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.610 
to learn how to create a realistic water
droplet<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:12.150> works<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.660> well<00:00:12.809> with

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
droplet and this works really well with

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.160 
droplet and this works really well with
images<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:15.389> close<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
images that you have up close and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340 
images that you have up close and
usually<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.220> some<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.510> details<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.199> for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
usually of some some details so for

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.679 
usually of some some details so for
example<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.100> some<00:00:20.390> leaves<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
example here we have some leaves of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.990 
example here we have some leaves of
plant<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.970> just

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
plant and what we can do here is just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.660 
plant and what we can do here is just
add<00:00:24.600> some<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:25.590> water<00:00:25.830> droplets<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.519> make

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
add some little water droplets to make

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
add some little water droplets to make
it<00:00:26.820> seem<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.359> actually<00:00:27.480> rained<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it seem like it actually rained so the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
it seem like it actually rained so the
way<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.400> simulate<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.269> we

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
way that we can simulate that is we

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
way that we can simulate that is we
bring<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.800> our<00:00:32.000> background<00:00:33.000> layer<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.600> are

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
bring up our background layer which are

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
bring up our background layer which are
layers<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> create<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
layers and that we're going to create a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.180 
layers and that we're going to create a
new<00:00:36.120> layer<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:37.530> we're<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:37.950> with

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
new layer and now we're going to go with

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240 
new layer and now we're going to go with
our<00:00:38.550> elliptical<00:00:39.360> marquee<00:00:39.809> tool<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.350> we're

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
our elliptical marquee tool and we're

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
our elliptical marquee tool and we're
going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> holding<00:00:42.059> down<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> shift<00:00:42.390> key

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
going to holding down the shift key

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
going to holding down the shift key
we're<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> create<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.390> circular

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we're going to create a circular

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
we're going to create a circular
selection<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.710> will<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> size<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
selection and this will be the size of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.970 
selection and this will be the size of
our<00:00:47.910> water<00:00:48.270> droplet<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> don't<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
our water droplet so you don't want to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.639 
our water droplet so you don't want to
create<00:00:50.129> something<00:00:50.340> too<00:00:50.610> big<00:00:50.820> because<00:00:51.649> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
create something too big because that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.439 
create something too big because that
wouldn't<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.039> realistic<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
wouldn't look realistic so you want to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
wouldn't look realistic so you want to
make<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> droplet<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> realistic<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
make a droplet that is realistic to the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
make a droplet that is realistic to the
size<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.699> photo<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
size of your photo so I think this is a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
size of your photo so I think this is a
really<00:00:59.070> small<00:00:59.399> nice<00:00:59.850> little<00:01:00.149> size-zero<00:01:00.329> for

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
really small nice little size-zero for

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
really small nice little size-zero for
water<00:01:00.989> droplet<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
water droplet and now what we can do is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.440 
water droplet and now what we can do is
go<00:01:03.480> into<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> gradient<00:01:04.290> tool<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:05.270> making<00:01:06.270> sure

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
go into a gradient tool here making sure

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
go into a gradient tool here making sure
that<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:07.530> gradient<00:01:07.979> tool

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that we are on the first gradient tool

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.780 
that we are on the first gradient tool
here<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> black<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.360> white<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.549> we<00:01:11.549> are

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
here of the black to white and we are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
here of the black to white and we are
going<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.570> left<00:01:12.780> right<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
going from left right here this is the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.640 
going from left right here this is the
linear<00:01:14.070> gradient<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.990> as<00:01:15.990> well<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.290> making

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
linear gradient and as well as making

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.499 
linear gradient and as well as making
that<00:01:16.950> making<00:01:17.369> sure<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> our<00:01:17.820> colors<00:01:18.390> are

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that making sure that our colors are

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.370 
that making sure that our colors are
default<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> press<00:01:19.770> D<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
default so we want to press D on the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.660 
default so we want to press D on the
keyboard<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:23.040> sure<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
keyboard to make sure that we are on a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
keyboard to make sure that we are on a
default<00:01:24.060> key<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.299> black<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.990> white<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.950> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
default key is black to white now we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.210 
default key is black to white now we
want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.409> corner<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.009> top

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
want to go on the corner here on the top

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490 
want to go on the corner here on the top
left<00:01:29.549> corner<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.180> drag<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.900> down<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
left corner and drag this down with the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.060 
left corner and drag this down with the
shift<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.970> bottom<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.750> corner<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
shift to the bottom right corner here so

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
shift to the bottom right corner here so
that<00:01:35.220> we're<00:01:35.340> creating<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.850> gradient<00:01:36.689> here

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that we're creating this gradient here

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.679 
that we're creating this gradient here
from<00:01:37.110> black<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.680> white<00:01:37.950> ok<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.270> deselect

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
from black to white ok we can deselect

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.069 
from black to white ok we can deselect
nap<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.520> change<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.820> mode<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:43.020> layer

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
nap and change the mode of this layer

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.370 
nap and change the mode of this layer
here<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:44.250> overlay<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.020> we're

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here to overlay and as you can see we're

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.789 
here to overlay and as you can see we're
starting<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.979> sort<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.490> create<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.570> look<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
starting to sort of create this look of

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
starting to sort of create this look of
the<00:01:50.070> water<00:01:50.280> droplet<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the water droplet here now we're just

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.450 
the water droplet here now we're just
going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> add<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.350> effects<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.040> complete

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
going to add some effects to complete

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.240 
going to add some effects to complete
that<00:01:53.640> look<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.630> need<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.259> add<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.920> drop

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that look so we need to do is add a drop

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.170 
that look so we need to do is add a drop
shadow<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.409> need<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> set<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.549> drop<00:01:59.969> shadow

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
shadow and we need to set a drop shadow

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.139 
shadow and we need to set a drop shadow
with<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.560> settings<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.490> low<00:02:02.939> opacity

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
with the settings of a low opacity

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.200 
with the settings of a low opacity
something<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> 45-percent<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:06.000> want

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
something like a 45-percent here we want

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.109 
something like a 45-percent here we want
to<00:02:06.299> set<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.140> distance<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.670> something

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to set the distance here to something

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.050 
to set the distance here to something
round<00:02:09.929> six<00:02:10.349> or<00:02:10.590> seven<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.879> see<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
round six or seven that you can see that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.340 
round six or seven that you can see that
we're<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.750> changing

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
we're just changing

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.990 
we're just changing
a distance<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.070> we<00:02:14.220> want<00:02:14.400> something<00:02:14.700> like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
a distance here we want something like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.990 
a distance here we want something like
six<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:15.420> seven<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:17.220> also<00:02:17.370> want<00:02:17.670> these

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
six or seven and we also want these

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.870 
six or seven and we also want these
signs<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.630> five<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.670> change

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
signs of five here and we want to change

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.280 
signs of five here and we want to change
the<00:02:21.180> angle<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:22.260> something<00:02:22.680> around<00:02:23.690> 150<00:02:24.690> or

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the angle to something around 150 or

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
the angle to something around 150 or
thereabouts--<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:26.910> something

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
thereabouts-- so that it's something

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.910 
thereabouts-- so that it's something
like<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.800> right<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.480> at<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.350> opposite

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
like so right so it's at the opposite

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.080 
like so right so it's at the opposite
angle<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.360> dark<00:02:33.780> area<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.370> water

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
angle to the dark area here of the water

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.090 
angle to the dark area here of the water
droplet<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.720> we're<00:02:36.840> creating<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> little<00:02:38.010> bit

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
droplet so we're creating a little bit

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.210 
droplet so we're creating a little bit
of<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> drop<00:02:38.460> shadow<00:02:38.670> where<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.570> slightest<00:02:40.220> okay

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
of a drop shadow where it slightest okay

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.670 
of a drop shadow where it slightest okay
now<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.000> want<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:42.420> into<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.050> inner<00:02:43.290> shadow

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
now we want to go into the inner shadow

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.640 
now we want to go into the inner shadow
and<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:45.210> also<00:02:45.360> want<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.690> set<00:02:45.930> another<00:02:46.140> setting

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
and we also want to set another setting

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.880 
and we also want to set another setting
we're<00:02:46.770> going<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.950> leave<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.280> opacity<00:02:48.170> 75%<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
we're going to leave the opacity 75% the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.980 
we're going to leave the opacity 75% the
distance<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.580> size<00:02:50.970> add<00:02:51.300> five<00:02:51.570> percent

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
distance and the size add five percent

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.850 
distance and the size add five percent
so<00:02:52.170> we're<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.320> going<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.620> leave<00:02:52.710> these

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
so we're just going to leave these

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.340 
so we're just going to leave these
basically<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.140> want

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
basically as they are but what we want

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.970 
basically as they are but what we want
to<00:02:55.410> do<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:56.930> change<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.050> angle<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.740> this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
to do here is change the angle of this

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.900 
to do here is change the angle of this
and<00:02:59.880> we're<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.210> change<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.690> angle<00:03:01.080> to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
and we're going to change the angle to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.080 
and we're going to change the angle to
something<00:03:02.910> around<00:03:03.360> d<00:03:05.690> 2825<00:03:07.580> angle<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.820> so

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
something around d 2825 angle here so

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.300 
something around d 2825 angle here so
that<00:03:09.270> we<00:03:09.300> also<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:10.320> sort<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.100> this

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
that we also have sort of like this

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.910 
that we also have sort of like this
highlight<00:03:11.970> here<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.900> out<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.290> darker

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
highlight here this out of this darker

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.760 
highlight here this out of this darker
inner<00:03:14.190> shadow<00:03:14.670> again<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.050> matching<00:03:16.650> up

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
inner shadow again that is matching up

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.930 
inner shadow again that is matching up
with<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:18.050> with<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.100> shadow<00:03:20.100> side<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:20.730> of

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
with the with the shadow side here of

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.450 
with the with the shadow side here of
the<00:03:21.330> water<00:03:21.720> droplet<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.500> we're<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.430> go

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
the water droplet so we're going to go

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.820 
the water droplet so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.850> click<00:03:24.000> OK<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.630> now<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.680> can

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
do is on a separate layer we're going to

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.550 
do is on a separate layer we're going to
grab<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> brush<00:03:29.340> here<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:30.320> we're<00:03:31.320> going<00:03:31.440> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
grab a brush here and we're going to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.940 
grab a brush here and we're going to
select<00:03:32.120> something<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.840> semi<00:03:34.290> hard<00:03:34.620> brush

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
select something of a semi hard brush

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.260 
select something of a semi hard brush
here<00:03:35.160> we're<00:03:35.250> going<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.460> select<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.090> one

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
highlights of the water droplet so there

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.940 
highlights of the water droplet so there
we<00:03:51.090> are<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.360> have<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> water<00:03:51.750> droplet<00:03:52.050> here<00:03:52.410> now

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
we are we have a water droplet here now

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.870 
we are we have a water droplet here now
I'm<00:03:53.010> going<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.220> show<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.400> something<00:03:53.700> else

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
I'm going to show you something else

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.100 
I'm going to show you something else
that's<00:03:54.150> kind<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.390> cool<00:03:54.540> we're<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.870> going<00:03:55.050> to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
that's kind of cool we're just going to

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.660 
that's kind of cool we're just going to
select<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> two<00:03:56.010> layers<00:03:56.160> here<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.520> group

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
select the two layers here and group

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.640 
select the two layers here and group
them<00:03:56.700> together<00:03:56.970> I'm<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.050> duplicate<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
them together I'm going to duplicate the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.090 
them together I'm going to duplicate the
layer<00:03:58.680> here<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.310> move<00:04:00.270> around<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:01.100> this

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
layer here and move around this this

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.310 
layer here and move around this this
water<00:04:02.340> droplet<00:04:02.760> here<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.810> I'm<00:04:03.930> just<00:04:03.960> going<00:04:04.200> to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
water droplet here and I'm just going to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.050 
water droplet here and I'm just going to
drop<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.590> here<00:04:05.130> for<00:04:05.370> example<00:04:05.490> I'm<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:05.970> go

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
drop it here for example I'm going to go

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.770 
drop it here for example I'm going to go
back<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.420> our<00:04:06.450> first<00:04:07.490> group<00:04:08.490> here<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.000> I'm

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
back to our first group here and I'm

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.260 
back to our first group here and I'm
going<00:04:09.960> to<00:04:10.020> go<00:04:10.170> into<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.560> actual<00:04:10.980> layer<00:04:11.970> here

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
going to go into the actual layer here

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.270 
going to go into the actual layer here
of<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.690> water<00:04:12.900> droplet<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.680> I'm<00:04:14.070> going<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
of the water droplet and I'm going to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.340 
of the water droplet and I'm going to
make<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.460> water<00:04:14.850> droplets<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:16.260> bit

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
make this water droplets a little bit

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.390 
make this water droplets a little bit
more<00:04:16.440> different<00:04:16.770> now<00:04:16.830> make<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.070> seem<00:04:17.370> like

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
more different now make it seem like

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.960 
more different now make it seem like
more<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:18.450> water<00:04:18.750> drop<00:04:19.620> as<00:04:20.460> opposed<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.940> just

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
more of a water drop as opposed to just

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.030 
more of a water drop as opposed to just
a<00:04:21.210> perfect<00:04:21.540> circle<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.620> way<00:04:22.710> we<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:22.950> do

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
a perfect circle and the way we can do

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.100 
a perfect circle and the way we can do
this<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.400> by<00:04:23.550> going<00:04:23.700> into<00:04:23.940> filter<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.600> liquify

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
this is by going into filter and liquify

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.170 
this is by going into filter and liquify
filter<00:04:25.790> liquify

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
filter liquify

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.870 
filter liquify
and<00:04:27.389> now<00:04:27.930> what<00:04:28.110> we<00:04:28.229> can<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.520> making<00:04:29.520> sure<00:04:29.550> that

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
and now what we can do making sure that

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.779 
and now what we can do making sure that
we<00:04:29.970> have<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> brush<00:04:30.600> size<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.229> appropriate

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
we have a brush size that is appropriate

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.939 
we have a brush size that is appropriate
so<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.810> brush<00:04:34.050> pressure<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.560> isn't<00:04:34.830> too

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
so and a brush pressure that isn't too

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.680 
so and a brush pressure that isn't too
big<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.699> we<00:04:35.820> want<00:04:35.970> something<00:04:36.330> around<00:04:36.449> in

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
big here so we want something around in

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.960 
big here so we want something around in
the<00:04:36.780> 30s<00:04:36.960> we'll<00:04:37.500> probably<00:04:37.710> do<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.190> now<00:04:38.789> what

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
the 30s we'll probably do and now what

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.550 
the 30s we'll probably do and now what
you<00:04:39.030> want<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.210> do<00:04:39.330> is<00:04:39.449> just<00:04:39.570> click<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.050> drag

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
you want to do is just click and drag

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.450 
you want to do is just click and drag
and<00:04:40.919> just<00:04:41.250> shape<00:04:41.660> that<00:04:42.660> water<00:04:43.560> droplet<00:04:44.039> so

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
and just shape that water droplet so

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.310 
and just shape that water droplet so
just<00:04:45.150> make<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.509> you<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.930> just<00:04:46.050> play<00:04:46.259> around

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
just make it you know just play around

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.409 
just make it you know just play around
with<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.650> see<00:04:47.460> what<00:04:47.610> works<00:04:47.850> best<00:04:48.060> for<00:04:48.210> you

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
with it see what works best for you

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.740 
with it see what works best for you
click<00:04:49.259> OK<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.800> as<00:04:50.789> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.090> see<00:04:51.120> here<00:04:51.570> we've

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
click OK and as you can see here we've

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.540 
click OK and as you can see here we've
modified<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.560> water<00:04:52.830> droplet<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.460> it

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
modified so that water droplet so it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.120 
modified so that water droplet so it
seems<00:04:53.789> like<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.210> just<00:04:54.680> dripping<00:04:55.680> away<00:04:55.860> and

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
seems like it's just dripping away and

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.969 
seems like it's just dripping away and
coming<00:04:56.789> here<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.840> that<00:04:58.020> part<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.590> circle

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
coming here to that part of the circle

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.790 
coming here to that part of the circle
here<00:04:59.160> so<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.870> essentially<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:01.169> really

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
here so that is essentially a really

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.710 
here so that is essentially a really
good<00:05:01.949> way<00:05:02.099> of<00:05:02.130> creating<00:05:02.610> water<00:05:03.030> droplets<00:05:03.539> is

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
good way of creating water droplets is

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.100 
good way of creating water droplets is
just<00:05:04.910> start<00:05:05.910> with<00:05:06.060> your<00:05:06.180> perfect<00:05:06.599> circle<00:05:06.960> and

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
just start with your perfect circle and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.950 
just start with your perfect circle and
then<00:05:07.740> play<00:05:08.250> around<00:05:08.490> with<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.479> liquify<00:05:09.930> filter

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
then play around with the liquify filter

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.320 
then play around with the liquify filter
to<00:05:10.710> actually<00:05:11.009> change<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.400> water<00:05:11.610> droplets<00:05:12.090> as

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
to actually change the water droplets as

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.420 
to actually change the water droplets as
you<00:05:12.419> see<00:05:12.599> fit<00:05:12.780> even<00:05:13.590> make<00:05:13.740> them<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.009> little<00:05:14.250> bit

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
you see fit even make them a little bit

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.640 
you see fit even make them a little bit
smaller<00:05:14.699> we<00:05:14.849> can<00:05:14.970> duplicate<00:05:15.180> them<00:05:15.570> here<00:05:15.840> move

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
smaller we can duplicate them here move

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.700 
smaller we can duplicate them here move
them<00:05:16.770> around<00:05:16.919> here<00:05:17.849> and<00:05:18.000> change<00:05:18.870> with<00:05:19.080> ctrl<00:05:19.500> T

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
them around here and change with ctrl T

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.830 
them around here and change with ctrl T
and<00:05:19.979> make<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.580> water<00:05:20.940> droplet<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.479> little<00:05:21.750> bit

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
and make that water droplet a little bit

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.650 
and make that water droplet a little bit
smaller<00:05:22.139> so<00:05:22.520> there<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.610> are<00:05:23.729> water<00:05:24.240> droplets

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
smaller so there you are water droplets

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.810 
smaller so there you are water droplets
