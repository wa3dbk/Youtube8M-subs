00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:16.770
 it was done with rubbish and then beauty guys 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.350
 welcome to another video in this video 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.390
 here i go the first try to find 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.630
 a weapon that has entered the international top 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.619
 one can found here and then I go 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 not there sup 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 It seems like a guy who died there 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.010
 for him, the pilot is here he sees there 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.149
 in baseball stadium right? 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 I'll try to kill him, I 've already found him here. 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.390
 weapons 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600
 so it will get easier since 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.730
 thinking that I did not find anything 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 I gave some houses but then I remembered 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 of these sakineh warriors so here you have 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.129
 a good item this hole that lies behind 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 the hospital building 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.469
 Come on try to kill him, huh? 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 was inside that the side runners 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 from the stadium 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.470
 so you have to be careful coming back from 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 planned how I'm going to go there 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.409
 Why the first time I got into it? 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 I started taking the shot no more time 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.490
 our unb he see you I'll do 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.490
 on here 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:31.439
 I think the guy died sdk and that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 I was in the last one down there. 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.180
 ranking 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 other guy but I thought it was that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.979
 capital with several kills and time 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.610
 there he alone had more than two pounds 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.360
 huh 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.360
 and I 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.390
 carry mate 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.450
 Wow, I went to carry the gun to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.310
 times even more cracked so sometimes the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.770
 of the ax was to carry a weapon that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:17.010
 It was not hotter either. 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:20.060
 our car was full of things and not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.060
 it does not fit anything else here 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.260
 mr 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.709
 nor did we want to have greater power 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.590
 carry things 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:36.510
 Look what we gave today is a kit. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:45.770
 this is going to be the series b becape 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.770
 now from 36 I think there was no bullet 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.670
 25 there is no bullet 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:06.690
 the bandage on the kaka and my work 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.340
 of series b cap 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.459
 now the brain does not backup every server 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.900
 It's very fast, we're assuming 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:20.459
 body but the things that are around 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.959
 even I got scared here the guy has 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.269
 a tent he is thinking of riding 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.170
 here having to carry the 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:32.360
 items nep rather nep rather thing like 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:44.459
 I do not have a tent, I'm looking for items 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:47.549
 that enfield antenna of the guy is here 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.989
 even on the side and then I came here 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.829
 get the things i carry first 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:58.850
 main tent is to keep a tent in 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:03.510
 a tent there and gathering some eternal 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.040

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.930
 because I was not uploading mp5 I have 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.540
 a mania of carrying arms 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.830
 so know almost love because 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.940
