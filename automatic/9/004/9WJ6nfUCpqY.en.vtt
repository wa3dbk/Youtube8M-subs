00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
prevents gingivitis there are a number
of<00:01:52.470> benefits<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.729> using<00:01:54.060> hydrogen

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
of benefits here to using hydrogen

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.980 
of benefits here to using hydrogen

of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> big<00:01:58.500> drawbacks<00:01:59.189> however<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.630> fact

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
of the big drawbacks however is the fact

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
of the big drawbacks however is the fact
that<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.409> only<00:02:01.590> using<00:02:01.860> three<00:02:02.280> percent

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that you're only using three percent

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.929 
that you're only using three percent
hydrogen<00:02:03.570> peroxide<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.350> say<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> why

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
hydrogen peroxide as I say here and why

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.479 
hydrogen peroxide as I say here and why
is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.149> important<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.310> higher<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
is that important well the higher the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.449 
is that important well the higher the
concentration<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:09.479> hydrogen<00:02:09.959> peroxide<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
concentration of hydrogen peroxide the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.000 
concentration of hydrogen peroxide the
more<00:02:11.730> white<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.150> teeth<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.540> become<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
more white your teeth will become so

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
more white your teeth will become so
if<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.909> are<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.299> really<00:02:15.720> looking<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
if you are really really looking to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.259 
if you are really really looking to
whiten<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:16.709> smile<00:02:17.069> if<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.819> already<00:02:18.090> pretty

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
whiten your smile if it's already pretty

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.149 
whiten your smile if it's already pretty
white<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.290> want<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> even<00:02:19.769> more<00:02:19.980> white

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
white and you want to even more white

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.130 
white and you want to even more white
then<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.939> probably<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.569> not<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.049> do

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
then this probably is not going to do

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.289 
then this probably is not going to do
anything<00:02:22.349> for<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.909> good<00:02:24.090> for

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
anything for you what this is good for

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.440 
anything for you what this is good for
