00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello and welcome i'm blaise 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.649
 always on the Cape of Antibes 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.920
 always with a gray time I will you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.440
 explain a second technique for 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.190
 take photographs of landscapes 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.430
 despite the gray weather the gray weather is 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.400
 manifested especially with ray a gray sky 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 so what we can do is avoid 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.980
 take the sky we go this fund is going to get 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:34.079
 focus instead on details of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 pieces of landscapes and panoramas where 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.410
 there is no sky or so little the sky 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 so here what I'm going to do is all 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.469
 just dropped the camera so 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.920
 to take back these blocks this mother but 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.590
 now just having a whole 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.559
 little bangs of heaven so like 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.190
 usually ysos in manual mode 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.399
 f juan mata f8 today and i'm going 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.399
 search 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.590
 my speed that will give me a good 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.350
 exhibition and there I am at a hundredth 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:17.230
 of second is gone I use 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.580
 always my remote control rfa 602 ok so 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.360
 that's my fault to the witnesses a 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.420
 hundredth of a second 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.520
 f 8 is what i'm going to do now 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.400
 my little magic boot 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.970
 today it is you already know 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.860
 his words aida end and 1000 this is a 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.820
 neutral gray filter look at early 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:45.220
 see bigger thing here so we're going 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.619
 slide this filter rails of an ale sees the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.150
 hate miles on the goal 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.220
 in order to have a super long exposure 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.509
 so I was a hundredth of a second f8 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.509
 it's going to take now that plays that 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.890
 day for a lot longer I 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.860
 realized that we are doing 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.840
 turning on the rear display I was coming 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.580
 to see a measure of exposure that was 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.140
 correct contrary to 1 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.050
 when I'm doing the exposure measurement 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.330
 directly in the viewfinder so I 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.660
 I turn on the screen 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.040
 back and I slide my speed up 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.700
 find the good I know I 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.470
 would give 15 15 20 seconds 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.060
 fifteen seconds ago it was going to be good 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.610
 I will put in 20 seconds 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.620
 there he shows me that I'm overexposed 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.240
 a third of dia go we still go there 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.690
 remote control and I left for 20 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.690
 seconds of exposure 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.820
 so what are you gonna do this 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.710
 filter end emile see the sea is enough 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.930
 quiet I have a little lapping there 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.930
 it's really I have no wind I have a 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.120
 little lapping and so suddenly the effect 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.450
 not going to be very pronounced but everywhere 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.550
 there especially against the coast one or there 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.990
 little wavelets touch the rocks 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.540
 I will have some kind of vegetables 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.160
 quite interesting enough so here is 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.580
 the exhibition is finished a thousandth of 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.510
 second 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.510
 f 8 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.110
 finally obviously very pronounced with the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.720
 small little wavelets where we have 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.100
 the effect of a much calmer mother 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.800
 but that's another effect that's 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.830
 extremely interesting to do with the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.650
 filter n 2006 you have less light 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.230
 or what you want to do but more your 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.300
 diaphragm you can quickly overtake 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.209
 the 30 seconds that are on a lot 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.560
 of devices the speed limit that can 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.810
 reach with in manual mode 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.200
 so for that there is baobab mode I 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.620
 will show you that so if I go there 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.260
 now from manual mode to baobab mode 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.870
 b here i just have a board that appears 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.709
 f 11 and so like now I'm going 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.709
 press my remote 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.170
 it does not work 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.600
 not at all now when I support 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.850
 on my remote I stay pressed 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.170
 the remote and there you see we have 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.020
 the seconds that started is incrementing 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:16.570
 and all regularly and obviously 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.780
 until I let go of the remote 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.120
 so here I have a wheel with a b 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.080
 on some cameras we get 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.290
 in manual mode 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.510
 we simply go beyond the 30 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.780
 seconds and after 30 seconds 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.980
 I'm going to have bobo that's showing here 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.960
 so we've seen two techniques now 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.150
 for landscapes in gray weather the 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.710
 first is the hdr and the second is 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.930
 focus less than the sky anymore on 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.280
 the foreground and if we go self with 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.200
 photos by the seashore of rivers have 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.850
 used the nb1000 we start with 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.310
 really interesting photos 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.240
 I have my boat coming 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.780
 take you say 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.780
 see you soon
