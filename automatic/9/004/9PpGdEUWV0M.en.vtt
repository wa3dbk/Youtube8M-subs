this<00:03:41.959> lure<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:44.090> they'll<00:03:44.270> come<00:03:44.510> after<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.900> from

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
this lure but they'll come after it from

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.060 
this lure but they'll come after it from
a<00:03:45.830> long<00:03:46.160> ways<00:03:46.550> away<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.800> just<00:03:48.950> your

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
a long ways away and this is just your

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.790 
a long ways away and this is just your
standard<00:03:49.130> x<00:03:49.760> wrap<00:03:50.770> X<00:03:52.630> X<00:03:53.630> R<00:03:53.900> 10<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.230> think<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.650> is

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
standard x wrap X X R 10 I think it is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.980 
standard x wrap X X R 10 I think it is
it's<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.459> 10<00:03:55.940> millimeter<00:03:56.390> 100<00:03:56.930> size<00:03:57.380> but

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
it's that 10 millimeter 100 size but

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.480 
it's that 10 millimeter 100 size but
what<00:03:59.990> I'm<00:04:00.110> getting<00:04:00.320> at<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.800> clown<00:04:01.130> color

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
what I'm getting at is this clown color

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.750 
what I'm getting at is this clown color
is<00:04:02.150> really<00:04:02.600> really<00:04:03.140> bright<00:04:03.380> obviously<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.310> it

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
is really really bright obviously and it

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.330 
is really really bright obviously and it
really<00:04:04.940> compensates<00:04:05.630> for<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:07.130> lack<00:04:07.280> of

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
really compensates for the lack of

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.460 
really compensates for the lack of
clarity<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.090> water<00:04:08.330> I<00:04:08.630> still<00:04:09.080> have<00:04:09.230> enough

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
clarity in the water I still have enough

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.350 
clarity in the water I still have enough
clarity<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:10.370> would<00:04:10.520> warrant<00:04:10.790> me<00:04:10.970> fishing<00:04:11.300> a

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
clarity that would warrant me fishing a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.300 
clarity that would warrant me fishing a
rip<00:04:11.510> bait<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.530> still<00:04:12.830> need<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.040> little<00:04:13.100> bit

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
rip bait but I still need a little bit

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.790 
rip bait but I still need a little bit
of<00:04:13.430> help<00:04:13.610> with<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.120> bright<00:04:14.660> bright<00:04:14.810> color<00:04:15.170> so
