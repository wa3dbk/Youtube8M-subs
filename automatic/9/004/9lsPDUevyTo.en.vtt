would play a game of hearthstone so for

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.450 
would play a game of hearthstone so for
instance<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.440> see<00:00:59.590> his<00:00:59.710> hero<00:00:59.920> power<00:01:00.010> there

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
instance you see his hero power there

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.840 
instance you see his hero power there
you<00:01:01.210> when<00:01:02.019> he<00:01:02.109> uses<00:01:02.289> his<00:01:02.440> hero<00:01:02.769> power<00:01:02.850> each

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
you when he uses his hero power each

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.730 
you when he uses his hero power each
player<00:01:04.180> puts<00:01:04.540> a<00:01:04.690> minion<00:01:05.050> from<00:01:05.440> their<00:01:05.560> deck

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
player puts a minion from their deck

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.920 
player puts a minion from their deck
into<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.010> battlefield<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.570> could<00:01:07.780> be<00:01:07.810> a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
into the battlefield so it could be a

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.330 
into the battlefield so it could be a
very<00:01:08.110> expensive<00:01:08.470> minion<00:01:08.980> and<00:01:09.130> they<00:01:09.220> don't

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
very expensive minion and they don't

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
very expensive minion and they don't
have<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.670> pay<00:01:09.700> for<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.540> makes<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.810> think

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
have to pay for it so it makes you think

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.230 
have to pay for it so it makes you think
maybe<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.220> don't<00:01:12.460> want<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.670> just<00:01:12.820> use<00:01:13.030> my<00:01:13.180> normal

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
maybe I don't want to just use my normal

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.210 
maybe I don't want to just use my normal
man<00:01:13.690> occur<00:01:14.020> when<00:01:14.350> I'm<00:01:14.470> when<00:01:14.710> I'm<00:01:14.740> building<00:01:15.160> a

man occur when I'm when I'm building a

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.710 
man occur when I'm when I'm building a
deck<00:01:15.400> for<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.670> maybe<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:16.000> want<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.240> play<00:01:16.390> very

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
deck for this maybe I want to play very

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.840 
deck for this maybe I want to play very
very<00:01:16.930> differently<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.100> know<00:01:18.430> as<00:01:18.640> he's

very differently so you know as he's

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.610 
very differently so you know as he's
playing<00:01:19.150> he's<00:01:19.300> thinking<00:01:19.780> about<00:01:20.020> these<00:01:20.230> these

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
playing he's thinking about these these

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.160 
playing he's thinking about these these
changes<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.700> we<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.180> make<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.570> play<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
Blackrock Mountain all 17 missions we

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.240 
Blackrock Mountain all 17 missions we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
have in all five wings operate in a very

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.850 
have in all five wings operate in a very
