00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.050
 count with nine against the ropes 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.610
 we start patrick in september add and subtract that is possible 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 if you refuse to add positive number to sports camp a bigger this is just 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.269
 completely on sun 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.460
 6 percent 9 n9 is greater than 6 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 you put on 6 and there comes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.009
 now comes to lie 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.249
 so all of them 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.599
 very normal 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.609
 then you can live there every day something that gets bigger 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.260
 if your positive number subtracts you in the square 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 ommel 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.760
 8 3 is 5 viewers then get 8 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.690
 only thought beginning job 8 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.120
 he had three from herent at 5 9 and the night 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.800
 this is with 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.080
 positive thoughts 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.600
 it is the exact opposite if you count negative with it 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.200
 if you get a negative number on the portal 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.200
 for example if you have 8 pours minus 3 then you get 5 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.820
 you mean if the true carlo reaches the blocks 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.190
 the temperature that 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.110
 in this case 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 free 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.230
 8 plus 3 3 is 5 and they get and 8 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.880
 if you point negative number somewhere 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.200
 already falls 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 then you will come will be more larger 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.640
 if you deduct from a number negative number on the large 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.800
 minus 3 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.990
 x get crow the blocks out of a boat hour 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.660
 the own 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 this goes three 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.550
 you see 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.000
 that there is more and more creative in the same calculation 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.460
 you noticed that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 6 nevertheless 3 tie 6 plus 3 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.389
 so you can rewrite six mini 3i as six points 3 it is both 9 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:19.009
 kicking a negative number in between is the same as on 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.919
 telephone number 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.919
 positive 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 the other two are also the same 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.079
 if you have 8 plus and minus 3 a similar 8 minus 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.479
 you can rewrite 8 plus minus 3 as 8 minus 3 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.709
 at 11 of the negative number is the same as planning to leave 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.399
 positive number 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.579
 you can put a very nice schedule on this 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.119
 you get that 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.039
 addition of positive number 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.039
 your answer gets bigger 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.359
 if you have points 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.359
 add negative argument 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.919
 then the bank becomes cue to 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.389
 at the carter of 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.869
 positive number 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.289
 angle to head also smaller 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:22.989
 and if you already leave negative number by your answer 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.879
 green 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.889
 It is wise to schedule this 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 good to understand good that you take over 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.769
 With the help of this schedule you can do everything for songs 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.620
 the other way around you can write many sums first 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.549
 for the molars 3 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.189
 thank you good looking 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.359
 and listen to this presentation
