set up Wi-Fi if you are within a zone
for<00:03:00.330> Wi-Fi<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.380> we're<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.010> connect

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
for Wi-Fi so we're just going to connect

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.640 
for Wi-Fi so we're just going to connect
it<00:03:02.640> now<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.269> could<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.540> either<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.049> secure

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
it now it could be either be a secure

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
it now it could be either be a secure

unsecured network that you're connecting

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.080 
unsecured network that you're connecting

to we're connecting to a secured network

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.640 
to we're connecting to a secured network
so<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.989> click<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.790> we<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:13.049> put<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
so we click it and we have to put in the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.670 
so we click it and we have to put in the
password<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:15.180> was<00:03:15.420> an<00:03:15.900> unsecured

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
password if this was an unsecured

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
password if this was an unsecured
network<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.489> would<00:03:17.640> not<00:03:17.790> need<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.120> put<00:03:18.299> in<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.570 
network you would not need to put in the
password<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:19.830> simply<00:03:20.130> going<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.340> enter

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
password so it's simply going to enter

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.479 
password so it's simply going to enter
that<00:03:20.610> now<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> click<00:03:22.260> connect<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.310> now

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
that now so I click connect and it's now

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.110 
that now so I click connect and it's now

connecting to the network just doing all

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.330 
connecting to the network just doing all

the relevant checks and in a moment that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.670 
the relevant checks and in a moment that
will<00:03:29.430> pop<00:03:29.670> up<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.090> say<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:30.989> connect

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.120 
will pop up and say that it is connect
it<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.600> now<00:03:33.750> connected<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.890> click

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
