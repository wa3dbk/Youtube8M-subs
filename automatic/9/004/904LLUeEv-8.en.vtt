freezing so if you're the very cold

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
freezing so if you're the very cold
climate<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.129> wouldn't<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> near<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
climate you wouldn't put it near a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.950 
climate you wouldn't put it near a
freezing<00:01:01.020> cold<00:01:01.050> window<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.770> wintertime<00:01:02.960> but

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
freezing cold window in wintertime but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
freezing cold window in wintertime but
it<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.589> survive<00:01:04.949> quite<00:01:05.250> well<00:01:05.659> indefinitely

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it can survive quite well indefinitely

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
it can survive quite well indefinitely
indeed<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.890> buy<00:01:08.100> some<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.520> eBay<00:01:08.850> they

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

just<00:01:09.270> send<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> cutting<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.380> even

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
just send you a cutting they don't even

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.070 
just send you a cutting they don't even
bother<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.010> wrap<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.400> roots<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
bother to wrap the roots up because it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.719 
bother to wrap the roots up because it
can<00:01:13.260> survive<00:01:13.619> quite<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> while<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
can survive quite a while just on the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.499 
can survive quite a while just on the
juice<00:01:14.909> inside<00:01:15.150> its<00:01:15.570> own<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.170> stem<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:18.270> course

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
juice inside its own and stem of course

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.710 
juice inside its own and stem of course
you<00:01:18.689> don't<00:01:18.960> buy<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.130> somehow<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you don't buy it in somehow and now the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.190 
you don't buy it in somehow and now the
temperature<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.680> hard<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.600> buy<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
temperature is very hard you buy it in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340 
temperature is very hard you buy it in
wintertime<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.390> put<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.750> inner<00:01:28.110> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
wintertime and they just put an inner in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.249 
wintertime and they just put an inner in
an<00:01:28.470> envelope<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:30.030> send<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.810> send

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
an envelope and they send it to I send

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.980 
an envelope and they send it to I send
your<00:01:31.350> cuttings<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.240> love<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> anyway<00:01:33.780> because

your cuttings I love it anyway because
it's<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.400> grow<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.790> water<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> air<00:01:37.430> well

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it's can just grow on water and air well

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.630 
it's can just grow on water and air well
it<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.700> last<00:01:38.880> indefinitely<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:40.049> water<00:01:40.640> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it can last indefinitely in water of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
it can last indefinitely in water of
course<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> hasn't<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:42.570> roots<00:01:42.780> fuel<00:01:43.079> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
course if it hasn't got roots fuel is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
course if it hasn't got roots fuel is
put<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> cutting<00:01:43.799> it'll<00:01:44.490> soon<00:01:45.060> shoot<00:01:45.329> roots

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
put in a cutting it'll soon shoot roots

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
put in a cutting it'll soon shoot roots
and<00:01:45.840> water<00:01:46.310> but<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.579> necessarily

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and water but they don't necessarily

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.899 
and water but they don't necessarily
live<00:01:48.329> forever<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> water<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.170> depends<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.130> bit

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
live forever in water just depends a bit

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999 
live forever in water just depends a bit
temperamental<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.659> suppose<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.560> love<00:01:52.770> them

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
