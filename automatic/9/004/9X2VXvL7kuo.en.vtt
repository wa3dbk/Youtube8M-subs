up mechana economical and they just roll
over<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.430> Zerg<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:17.970> don't<00:02:18.150> want<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.450> open

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
build comms going to go for here might

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.360 
build comms going to go for here might
go<00:02:52.050> from<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> decent

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
go from you is because this is a decent

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.440 
go from you is because this is a decent
map<00:02:53.760> for<00:02:54.060> Mutis<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.480> least<00:02:54.630> early<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
map for Mutis at least early on but the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.000 
map for Mutis at least early on but the
problem<00:02:57.780> with<00:02:57.840> muse<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.530> quite<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
problem with muse is there is quite a

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.210 
problem with muse is there is quite a
bit<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.280> distance<00:02:59.790> between<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.270> maps<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:02.070> at

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
bit of distance between the maps so at

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.520 
bit of distance between the maps so at
least<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:03.750> gonna<00:03:03.840> take<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.350> little

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
least you know it's gonna take a little

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.470 
least you know it's gonna take a little
bit<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.920> get<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.190> them<00:03:05.280> out<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:05.460> but<00:03:06.030> i<00:03:06.060> think

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
bit to get at them out there but i think

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.610 
bit to get at them out there but i think
it's<00:03:06.660> not<00:03:06.840> gonna<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> problem<00:03:07.200> for<00:03:07.410> him

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
it's not gonna be a problem for him

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.340 
it's not gonna be a problem for him
probably<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:07.980> gonna<00:03:08.070> go<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.700> um<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.990> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
probably is gonna go for that um and the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.930 
probably is gonna go for that um and the
reeses<00:03:10.710> gonna<00:03:10.830> be<00:03:10.890> able<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.070> hold<00:03:11.340> sky<00:03:11.760> high

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
reeses gonna be able to hold sky high

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.340 
reeses gonna be able to hold sky high
inside<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.270> his<00:03:12.360> eyes<00:03:12.450> that's<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:13.080> just

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
inside of his eyes that's not just

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.200 
inside of his eyes that's not just
getting<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.740> it's<00:03:14.280> not<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.430> important<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
getting that it's not just important to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
but it's also very important to keep the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.180 
but it's also very important to keep the
turn<00:03:21.510> back<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.290> game<00:03:22.500> keep<00:03:22.860> him<00:03:23.010> inside
