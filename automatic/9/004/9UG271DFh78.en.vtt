00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
little spooked well we kind of started

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.210 
little spooked well we kind of started
with<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.750> base<00:01:47.900> layout<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.350> Alcatraz<00:01:48.800> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
entire island we ended up roughing out

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.380 
entire island we ended up roughing out
in<00:01:51.800> kind<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.100> white<00:01:52.250> box<00:01:52.490> form<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.090> then

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
in kind of a white box form and then

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.730 
in kind of a white box form and then
figuring<00:01:53.660> out<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:53.930> play<00:01:54.080> spaces<00:01:54.320> we<00:01:54.500> wanted

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
figuring out what play spaces we wanted

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.810 
figuring out what play spaces we wanted
to<00:01:54.770> use<00:01:54.860> out<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.250> will<00:01:55.490> be<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.700> most

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
to use out of that will be the most

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.670 
to use out of that will be the most
interesting<00:01:56.270> areas<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.930> play<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
interesting areas to play and the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.380 
interesting areas to play and the

that the public doesn't necessary to we

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.780 
that the public doesn't necessary to we
really<00:02:03.140> did<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.440> lot<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.650> pushing<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.220> really

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
really did a lot of pushing to really

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.910

that we're really looking for this is a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.660 
that we're really looking for this is a
really<00:02:09.170> good<00:02:09.290> opportunity<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.950> really<00:02:10.429> tell

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
really good opportunity to really tell

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.290
