00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.480
 and there is the staff had spoken in fanpage 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.270
 want to review the kit cm storm 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.460
 devastator is and let's go, right? 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.220
 takashi here has some information on 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 several languages ​​portuguese japanese german 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.550
 or going out there will 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.110
 Let's see from here and there it is to know that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.620
 This little one here I'll start with 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.620
 Mouse 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:52.920
 I only here is the mouse it appears to be 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
 rubber but it is a plastic're 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.469
 personal and it is not rubber up here 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.840
 It means on the side, yes, an eraser. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.439
 is not to slip your finger nor 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.140
 nothing of the type and if it dies here it is optic 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.020
 it's not the law, he has 2,000 teams 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.020
 here the 6th dp little button on the bar 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 his roll is good because she's like 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 a little big is not so far from the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.009
 your finger if you want to play 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 change but here I know it fits well 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 even in the hand will also depend very much on the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.619
 your hand but the side buttons for you 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.350
 make settings in the game here son 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.350
 We'll show him to you. 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 it's not very big it's a 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.580
 normal path is very good is not bathed 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 So you have people who have 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 such as interference or anything 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.730
 the kind this one is not gold-plated 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.330
 it is a mouse cost benefit then without 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.380
 chance 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.040
 now I'll show him the differential 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.140
 left it connected here and that's it 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.690
 one of the differences of this mouse is the led 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 it has a led on the scroll bar, and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.800
 also up here in the corner too 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.320
 There are 22 two fractions here and no escapes. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.160
 also sailed to say out the brightness of 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.230
 led ne 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.030
 I do not know if there is another color I just 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.340
 I see there selling blue so do not 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.960
 know if you only have this thing if you 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.300
 I'll leave the application to you 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.300
 Now we go to the keyboard 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.590
 here is the keyboard to it either is not 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.640
 He's drunk, he's a kind of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.070
 plastic 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.150
 here the details they are black piano gives 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.730
 to see well and I expect more keys 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.800
 Here's the default setting for you to do 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.370
 class to lower and raise the volume and 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.370
 show you too 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.250
 just like the mouse 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.540
 the differential of this keyboard is also the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.540
 show lighting connect 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.500
 here , angelim arrived here you 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.500
 press this button that is close to the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.690
 paulo henrique and the mouse connects the mouse or 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.720
 the keyboard find out how you can 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.300
 to perceive is not only internally that 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.380
 is lit but between the keys too and 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.770
 this is very interesting 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.960
 My recommendation to you is to try 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.880
 play the fiddle on the keyboard with malcom 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.560
 It's painful because it says it here. 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.150
 start getting ugly those little hole 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.980
 with aluísio azanha so it is very 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.980
 that's interesting 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.530
 His son also has a good size 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.390
 both the way the keyboard appears on the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.010
 screen the exact size of his son to 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.460
 anyone who has an interest is not 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.110
 armored car does not have the gold tip as 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.230
 some more expensive 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.230
 behind him let it show you have 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.880
 these rubbers here that serve not to 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.790
 slide or anything of the case type 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.740
 you can not the feet its presence is 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.990
 standard also the whole cabinet so 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.850
 say everything keyboard is like that and that's it 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.580
 personnel inside it also comes with 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.950
 normal manual does not come from drivers 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.410
 You have to on the site to download the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.410
 it and that's it levels 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.800
 This is what was bought at a mall. 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.940
 It's pretty cheap, it was 140 reais per 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.650
 cause of freight but he was being 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.900
 sold at 120 is interesting for those who 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.750
 are you ready to buy a kit? 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.580
 cost-effective quality 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.740
 This is it, I 'll stay here and I'll wait 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.740
 that you liked and even more 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.560
 This is going to come out and it's going there.
