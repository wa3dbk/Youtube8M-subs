00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
between us and our ancestors we don't

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.500 
between us and our ancestors we don't
actually<00:02:48.840> own<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.350> land<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.880> we<00:02:50.880> are<00:02:51.030> part<00:02:51.360> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
actually own the land but we are part of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.310 
actually own the land but we are part of
it<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.920> these<00:02:52.920> stories<00:02:53.810> importantly<00:02:54.810> tell<00:02:55.230> us

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
it and these stories importantly tell us

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.120 
it and these stories importantly tell us
how<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.650> feel<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.480> story<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.170> really<00:02:58.680> about

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
how we feel the story is really about

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.660 
how we feel the story is really about
how<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.060> birds<00:03:00.420> got<00:03:00.660> their<00:03:00.870> colors<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.670> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
how the birds got their colors and it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.510 
how the birds got their colors and it
also<00:03:02.940> explains<00:03:03.540> why<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.960> crow<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:05.130> playing

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
also explains why the crow is playing

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.590 
also explains why the crow is playing
and<00:03:07.220> importantly<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.730> what<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.210> see<00:03:09.420> in

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
and importantly I think what we see in

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.850 
and importantly I think what we see in
there<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:11.400> see<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.760> uniqueness<00:03:12.150> of

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
there is that we see the uniqueness of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.240 
there is that we see the uniqueness of
how<00:03:13.860> these<00:03:14.100> stories<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:15.600> know<00:03:16.250> basically

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
how these stories you know basically

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.560 
how these stories you know basically
bring<00:03:17.580> together<00:03:17.850> all<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:19.440> birds<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
bring together all of the birds but I

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.140 
bring together all of the birds but I
think<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.800> certainly<00:03:23.430> teaching<00:03:24.000> our

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
think for certainly teaching our

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.460 
think for certainly teaching our
children<00:03:24.710> it<00:03:25.710> allows<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.910> relate<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
children it allows them to relate to the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.070 
children it allows them to relate to the
issues<00:03:28.980> around<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:30.090> crow<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.930> other

issues around the crow and the other

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.800 
issues around the crow and the other

birds and the differences that only

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.930 
birds and the differences that only
important<00:03:34.320> it's<00:03:34.800> one<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.280> most<00:03:35.430> essential

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
important it's one of the most essential

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.450

here we are here in Australia and it's

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.190 
here we are here in Australia and it's
important<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.230> think<00:04:01.320> for<00:04:01.710> us<00:04:02.160> as<00:04:02.220> Australians

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
important I think for us as Australians

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.900 
important I think for us as Australians
to<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.320> able<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.590> understand<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.460> important
