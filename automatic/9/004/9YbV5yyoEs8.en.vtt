hybrid<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.559> surreal<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:44.329> started<00:00:45.329> thinking

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
hybrid then surreal I started thinking

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
hybrid then surreal I started thinking
about<00:00:45.719> how<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> undergo<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.520> kinds

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
about how to make it undergo all kinds

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600 
about how to make it undergo all kinds
of<00:00:48.320> transformations<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.950> more<00:00:50.160> minimal<00:00:50.489> way

of transformations in a more minimal way

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
of transformations in a more minimal way
but<00:00:51.239> also<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.899> much<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.379> extreme<00:00:52.680> way

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
but also in a much more extreme way

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.439 
but also in a much more extreme way
that's<00:00:53.399> how<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.579> came<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> wedding

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that's how we came to think of wedding

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.220 
that's how we came to think of wedding
dresses<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:55.590> they're<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.579> ultimate

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
dresses because they're the ultimate

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.010 
dresses because they're the ultimate
opposites<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.440> immense<00:00:59.280> shared<00:00:59.520> reading

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.829 

Vikrant<00:01:02.770> off<00:01:02.920> always<00:01:03.129> do<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.700> bold<00:01:04.239> silhouette

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
Vikrant off always do a bold silhouette

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.330 
Vikrant off always do a bold silhouette
and<00:01:04.989> I'm<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.229> fan<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.650> bold<00:01:05.830> silhouette

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
and I'm the fan of the bold silhouette

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.250 
and I'm the fan of the bold silhouette
so<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.850> thought<00:01:07.299> that<00:01:07.420> was<00:01:07.570> fun<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:07.960> loved<00:01:08.140> the
