00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to do is what I did I just wiggled it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.190 
to do is what I did I just wiggled it
like<00:01:07.740> crazy<00:01:08.189> any<00:01:09.090> event<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.869> wiggle<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
like crazy with a pair of pliers and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
like crazy with a pair of pliers and
eventually<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:13.950> fell<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
eventually it just fell off you have to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
eventually it just fell off you have to
take<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.540> door<00:01:15.750> off<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.290> window<00:01:17.720> everything

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
take the door off the window everything

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.399 
take the door off the window everything
but<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.070> eventually<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> off<00:01:21.409> it's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but you can eventually get it off it's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.490 
but you can eventually get it off it's
not<00:01:22.850> too<00:01:23.850> bad<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> pain<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
not too bad it's a pain in the a but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
not too bad it's a pain in the a but
it's<00:01:25.830> better<00:01:26.070> than<00:01:26.280> taking<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it's better than taking it to the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's better than taking it to the
dealership<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.250> then<00:01:29.750> obviously<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> just

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
dealership and then obviously you just

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.130 
dealership and then obviously you just
need<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.520> tumbler<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
need to take out the little tumbler so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.920 
need to take out the little tumbler so
you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.740> new<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.720> when<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you can put it in your new one when you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can put it in your new one when you
get<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.530> ordered<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.799> parts<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.280> should

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
get it I just ordered my parts I should

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
get it I just ordered my parts I should
be<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.930> I'll<00:01:40.020> probably

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
be here in a little bit so I'll probably

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
be here in a little bit so I'll probably
make<00:01:40.530> another<00:01:40.590> video<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> comes<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
make another video when it comes to that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.109 
make another video when it comes to that
time<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.970> guy<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.850> online

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
time the guy in the other on the online

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
time the guy in the other on the online
tutorial<00:01:48.600> said<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> had<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> take<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.770> out

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
tutorial said you had to take it all out

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.280 
tutorial said you had to take it all out
and<00:01:50.280> remove<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.180> ridges<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> put

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and remove the little ridges and put

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.649 
and remove the little ridges and put
them<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> new<00:01:52.680> tumbler<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.119> exactly

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
them in the new tumbler I'm not exactly

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.300 
them in the new tumbler I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:54.840> why<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:55.979> put<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
sure why I think you can just put the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.359 
sure why I think you can just put the
tumbler<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:58.290> obviously<00:01:58.740> we'll<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.189> when

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
tumbler in but obviously we'll see when

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.730 
tumbler in but obviously we'll see when
we<00:01:59.399> get<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.079> questions<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
