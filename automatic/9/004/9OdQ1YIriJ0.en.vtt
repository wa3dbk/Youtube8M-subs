of the Traveling microphones anyway all
joking<00:05:39.100> aside<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.760> think<00:05:40.000> it's<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.540> very<00:05:40.750> big

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
joking aside I think it's a very big

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.140 
joking aside I think it's a very big
deal<00:05:41.020> I<00:05:41.470> think<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.490> could<00:05:42.640> potentially<00:05:42.760> be

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
deal I think it could potentially be

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.200 
deal I think it could potentially be
quite<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.180> thing<00:05:46.450> I<00:05:46.950> really<00:05:47.950> do<00:05:48.070> and<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.880> think<00:05:48.910> it

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
quite a thing I really do and I think it

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.350 
quite a thing I really do and I think it
could<00:05:49.330> help<00:05:49.980> somebody<00:05:50.980> get<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.180> that<00:05:52.300> next

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
could help somebody get to that next

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.780 
could help somebody get to that next
level<00:05:52.660> and<00:05:53.020> that's<00:05:53.890> the<00:05:54.130> reason<00:05:54.280> that<00:05:54.460> I'm<00:05:54.640> in

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
level and that's the reason that I'm in

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.830 
level and that's the reason that I'm in
this<00:05:54.940> thing<00:05:55.000> in<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.270> first<00:05:55.330> place<00:05:55.600> so<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:57.840> would

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
this thing in the first place so I would

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.680 
this thing in the first place so I would
encourage<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.230> in<00:05:59.530> any<00:05:59.950> state<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.690> any

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
encourage you in any state in any

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.690 
encourage you in any state in any

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
condition of getting music up this would

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.790
