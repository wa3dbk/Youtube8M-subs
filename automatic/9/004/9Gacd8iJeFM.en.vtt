00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
this is near where you film the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.650

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
encounter is that right yes seems like a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.680 
encounter is that right yes seems like a
vast<00:03:22.260> area<00:03:22.590> that's<00:03:23.100> huge<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:24.090> actually<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
vast area that's huge it's actually the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.070 
vast area that's huge it's actually the
largest<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.530> natural<00:03:26.010> park<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.640> world

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
largest the natural park in the world

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.160 
largest the natural park in the world
and<00:03:28.080> also<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.709> coastal<00:03:29.580> per<00:03:29.790> service<00:03:30.209> for

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
and also a coastal per service for

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.190 
and also a coastal per service for
marine<00:03:32.010> mammals<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.540> think<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:33.959> of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
marine mammals and I think because of

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.560 
marine mammals and I think because of
our<00:03:34.530> footage<00:03:35.160> was<00:03:35.370> taking<00:03:35.820> near<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.269> area

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
our footage was taking near that area

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.550 
our footage was taking near that area
then<00:03:37.940> there<00:03:38.940> was<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.450> lot<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:39.959> concern<00:03:40.530> about

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
then there was a lot of concern about

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.940 
then there was a lot of concern about
the<00:03:41.070> disturbances<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.690> habitat<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
the disturbances to this habitat and and

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.909 
the disturbances to this habitat and and
and<00:03:44.489> what<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.090> may<00:03:45.299> affect<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.230> animals

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
and what that may affect to the animals

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.220 
and what that may affect to the animals
there
