00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.980 
the mushroom sort of sitting back a
little<00:05:02.410> bit<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.650> an<00:05:02.740> angle<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:04.539> center<00:05:04.870> of

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
little bit of an angle the center of

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.890 
little bit of an angle the center of
gravity<00:05:05.470> it's<00:05:05.950> a<00:05:06.039> little<00:05:06.280> forward<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.840> I'm

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
gravity it's a little forward so I'm

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.540 
gravity it's a little forward so I'm
going<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.110> put<00:05:08.229> my<00:05:08.350> hook<00:05:08.560> right<00:05:08.590> here<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.430> the
