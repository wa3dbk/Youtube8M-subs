00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.359
 totally different things but they can fit 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.120
 one without institution like Luis 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.120
 impeccable and implacable firpo angel 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:17.980
 in the search to return to the first 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.380
 division played and five dates of the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.529
 competition the last game what 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.589
 managed yesterday in own house received the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.929
 visit of the audacious team of 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:34.450
 apastepeque and the public as always 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.550
 lively and trying to get off the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.340
 steps towards the court that optimism that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.789
 it is obvious that he receives it in a cast 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.699
 fruit eco that plays good almost to 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.100
 pleasure not even if I win with a marker is a 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.440
 little closed like this the one searched for 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.989
 free throws from far away and very 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.660
 warmly the apastepeque team is 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.050
 it was a very clear opportunity that covered 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.269
 the goalkeeper but there was already position 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.850
 further advanced the flags say 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.140
 they anchored and they wanted it to wave too 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.100
 the zest for sight 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.100
 a headbutt that carries high on the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.780
 goal of the team and I felt not the serve 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.790
 of hands the quick exit but not 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.450
 it works we are going to see set pieces 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.680
 direct at the hands of the keeper's cut 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 the lagoon or lake 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.610
 and many satisfactions to the hobby 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.440
 usuluteca that now attends perhaps more than 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.170
 when I was in the first division and 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.020
 he lives and celebrates it either and fight 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.090
 that's why I told him and shared that 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.159
 this descent to the circus will return 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.840
 strengthened the first division well 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.360
 it seems that it will be strengthened in 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.210
 the one that she is unifying I know because I 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.860
 the directive said it in other programs 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.050
 of circus you are seeing much more 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.090
 entering with the audience to be giving 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.920
 a lot more truth advertising that's 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.480
 is seeing a lot more organization in the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.150
 good campus well let's listen 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.800
 usuluteco team marlon martÃ­nez el 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.230
 author of both this triumph and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.230
 rÃºsvel saravia here is 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.190
 I was given the opportunity to write this 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 match 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.790
 for the victory here at home I think we 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.970
 we are doing very strong and it is the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 environment of the team to go out and win here 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.950
 at home and as I repeat, the team is 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.480
 mentalizado in classifying as soon as 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.130
 possible yes thank you is proving 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.440
 inside the court 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.930
 if the truth is that if that motivates the group 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.370
 because we know that playing here at home 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.350
 the points have to stay and the truth 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.240
 that how important we are always the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.319
 head and then that the work that we have 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.239
 done and it's the goal that we take 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.739

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.719

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.290
