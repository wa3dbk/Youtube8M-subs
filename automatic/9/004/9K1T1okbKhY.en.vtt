 is downloaded in all three well 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.440
 successively then stick back 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.119
 of the other after they hit the other and they're 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.970
 the three well these three once once 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.060

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.730
 once downloaded those three files are 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 they go to the 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.300
 to the location of the download I by 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.610
 example in my case here in downloads 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.850
 good the next thing we have to do 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.680
 is to unzip all these files or 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.680
 extract these files 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.110
 the 3 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:54.210
 good people what we have to do is 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:57.050
 go to this install this little program this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.420
 program will serve to download 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.390
 many games 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.060
 then they also install the heap 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.060
 ok you install and point 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.800
 the one of the mount serves to extract 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.110
 open the image did good once 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.500
 they did all that process and once 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.210
 they install these and it will appear like this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.090
 double click here 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.300
 and here is the location of the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.370
 where they want the download to go in their 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.980
 case, put the desk on it like that 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.150
 it does better in my case they are 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.150
 downloads here 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.220
 I 'm going to cancel it because what 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.840
 I have in the team good the following 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.069
 we go where he is downloaded 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.459
 the good game will fight here is click 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.420
 right and extract here I have it here 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.489
 look 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.230
 then these three will come out 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.500
 four 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.970
 so it will come out to these four files 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.710
 good files this is montull- ok 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.460
 well the following the next thing that 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.460
 we have to do is 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.390
 I will go to glock 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.390
 let's say in the engine 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:27.230
 and here it does not seem good anymore and after 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.060
 style with what we put here that I 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.060
 will teach an easier way to 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.080
 to install all the light 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.680

 this is the c 1 here says yes and 1 and from 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.769
 the end and 2 when they open it like that and no longer 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.790
 it is necessary to install the been and everything as 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.230
 others ask you well we hope that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.440

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.099

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.750
 in your downloaded game 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.750
