there and back again this is a toy I

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.340 
there and back again this is a toy I
remember<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.000> my<00:00:16.150> childhood<00:00:16.630> when<00:00:16.869> my<00:00:16.990> parents

remember of my childhood when my parents
made<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.530> large<00:00:17.800> cardboard<00:00:18.160> version<00:00:18.580> of<00:00:18.670> it<00:00:18.760> and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
made a large cardboard version of it and

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.190 
made a large cardboard version of it and
it<00:00:19.000> was<00:00:19.060> not<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.240> frog<00:00:19.540> you've<00:00:19.750> had<00:00:19.900> to<00:00:19.990> go<00:00:20.020> all

it was not a frog you've had to go all

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.510 
it was not a frog you've had to go all
the<00:00:20.290> way<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.410> one<00:00:20.680> end<00:00:20.920> of<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.100> string<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.340> all

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
the way to one end of the string and all

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.340 
the way to one end of the string and all
the<00:00:21.580> way<00:00:21.670> back<00:00:21.820> again<00:00:21.939> and<00:00:22.810> we<00:00:22.930> had<00:00:23.080> about

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
the way back again and we had about

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.780 
the way back again and we had about
several<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.800> them<00:00:23.920> all<00:00:24.070> going<00:00:24.490> down<00:00:24.670> the

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
several of them all going down the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.690 
several of them all going down the
living<00:00:25.029> room<00:00:25.180> floor<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.689> us<00:00:26.260> four<00:00:27.099> is<00:00:27.279> racing

very<00:00:30.010> simple<00:00:30.280> toy<00:00:30.430> which<00:00:30.610> I<00:00:30.670> picked<00:00:30.850> up<00:00:30.940> in

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
very simple toy which I picked up in

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.790 
very simple toy which I picked up in
1993<00:00:31.810> probably<00:00:32.230> in<00:00:32.290> New<00:00:32.349> York<00:00:32.590> at<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.770> time

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
1993 probably in New York at the time

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.920 
1993 probably in New York at the time
but<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:33.370> found<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.059> was<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.239> bit<00:00:34.360> easier<00:00:34.390> for<00:00:34.720> me

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
but I found that was a bit easier for me

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.119 
but I found that was a bit easier for me
because<00:00:35.080> I've<00:00:35.199> had<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.379> lot<00:00:35.470> of<00:00:35.650> things<00:00:35.830> and

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
because I've had a lot of things and

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.619 
because I've had a lot of things and
filled<00:00:36.309> up<00:00:36.400> about<00:00:36.520> two<00:00:36.850> or<00:00:36.940> three<00:00:37.000> three<00:00:37.570> or

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
filled up about two or three three or

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.360 
filled up about two or three three or
four<00:00:37.780> cases<00:00:37.930> like<00:00:38.199> this<00:00:38.410> always<00:00:38.620> interesting

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
four cases like this always interesting

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.400 
four cases like this always interesting
toys<00:00:39.610> this<00:00:40.330> was<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.600> particular<00:00:41.020> nice<00:00:41.199> fine

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
toys this was a particular nice fine

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.320 
toys this was a particular nice fine
because<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.739> do<00:00:41.860> remember<00:00:42.129> a<00:00:42.309> childhood<00:00:42.760> and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
because I do remember a childhood and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.030 
because I do remember a childhood and
then<00:00:43.600> go<00:00:43.750> for<00:00:43.960> very<00:00:44.080> simple<00:00:44.320> stuffs<00:00:44.739> are<00:00:44.890> very

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
then go for very simple stuffs are very

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.889 
then go for very simple stuffs are very
sophisticated<00:00:45.160> at<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:45.910> same<00:00:46.000> time<00:00:46.450> also<00:00:46.750> from

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
sophisticated at the same time also from

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.440 
sophisticated at the same time also from
America<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:47.950> is<00:00:48.010> an<00:00:48.370> image<00:00:48.640> conduit<00:00:49.059> I<00:00:49.239> think

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
America this is an image conduit I think

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.030 
America this is an image conduit I think
it<00:00:49.510> was<00:00:49.600> probably<00:00:49.780> surplus<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.680> stuff

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
it was probably surplus and stuff

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.680 
it was probably surplus and stuff
absorbed<00:00:51.610> by<00:00:51.790> an<00:00:51.910> American<00:00:52.239> company<00:00:52.270> doing

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
absorbed by an American company doing

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.389 
absorbed by an American company doing
silver<00:00:53.020> for<00:00:53.590> some<00:00:53.920> sort<00:00:54.160> of<00:00:54.219> aircraft

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
silver for some sort of aircraft

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.389 
silver for some sort of aircraft
instrumentation<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.920> looks<00:00:57.190> completely

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
instrumentation so it looks completely

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.430 
instrumentation so it looks completely
blank<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.739> tube<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.190> fiber-optic<00:01:01.440> when

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
blank it's a tube of fiber-optic when

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.020 
blank it's a tube of fiber-optic when
you<00:01:02.500> place<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.010> some<00:01:03.040> printing<00:01:03.550> material

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
you place it on some printing material

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
you place it on some printing material
push<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.110> down<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.440> touches<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.039> printing

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
push it down it touches the printing

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.710 
push it down it touches the printing
material<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:06.910> then<00:01:07.240> move<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.479> back<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
material and then move it back and

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.600 
material and then move it back and
forward<00:01:07.960> it's<00:01:08.200> actually<00:01:08.560> bringing<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.280> image

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
forward it's actually bringing the image

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.190 
forward it's actually bringing the image
of<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.940> bashar<00:01:10.210> up<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.720> top<00:01:10.960> surface

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
of the bashar up to this top surface

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.560 
of the bashar up to this top surface
which<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.680> about<00:01:11.890> six<00:01:12.220> inches<00:01:12.340> higher<00:01:12.729> and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
which is about six inches higher and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.960 
which is about six inches higher and
this<00:01:14.350> ascent<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.770> probably<00:01:15.160> used<00:01:15.399> in<00:01:15.700> aircraft

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
this ascent is probably used in aircraft

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.910 
this ascent is probably used in aircraft

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
clearly up like that had to be very

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.370 
clearly up like that had to be very
precisely<00:01:20.920> made<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.450> perfect<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.110> then<00:01:23.229> you

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
precisely made so perfect and then you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.279 
precisely made so perfect and then you
lift<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.220> up<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.459> disappears<00:01:24.910> again<00:01:25.289> she

lift it up it disappears again she

lift it up it disappears again she
interesting<00:01:26.619> enough<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.009> does<00:01:27.160> actually<00:01:27.369> work

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
interesting enough it does actually work

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.359 
interesting enough it does actually work

also<00:01:35.170> from<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.530> same<00:01:35.709> time<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:35.950> came<00:01:36.220> across<00:01:36.369> a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
also from the same time I came across a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.190 
also from the same time I came across a
very<00:01:36.640> sophisticated<00:01:36.940> version<00:01:37.660> of<00:01:37.840> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
very sophisticated version of the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440 
very sophisticated version of the
bouncing<00:01:38.800> ball<00:01:38.979> effects<00:01:39.459> and<00:01:39.670> what<00:01:40.149> I<00:01:40.179> did<00:01:40.360> was

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
bouncing ball effects and what I did was

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.270 
bouncing ball effects and what I did was
to<00:01:40.569> combine<00:01:40.720> these<00:01:40.959> two<00:01:41.229> together<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.800> ask

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
to combine these two together and ask

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.680 
to combine these two together and ask
people<00:01:42.429> which<00:01:42.759> board<00:01:43.119> is<00:01:43.300> going<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.509> bounce

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
people which board is going to bounce

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.749 
people which board is going to bounce
higher<00:01:43.990> there's<00:01:44.289> a<00:01:44.319> born<00:01:44.530> in<00:01:44.679> there<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.610> this

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759

simple to bounce ball inside and this is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.740 
simple to bounce ball inside and this is

patterns<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:08.159> think<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.550> can<00:05:08.699> probably<00:05:08.819> read

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:09.149 
patterns I think you can probably read

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:11.119 
patterns I think you can probably read
your<00:05:09.330> own<00:05:09.419> games<00:05:09.749> with<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.050> but<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:10.830> quite

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
your own games with it but it's quite

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.649 
your own games with it but it's quite
quite<00:05:11.550> pleasing<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.969> way<00:05:12.089> it<00:05:12.210> rolls<00:05:12.419> around

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
quite pleasing the way it rolls around

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.079 
quite pleasing the way it rolls around
and<00:05:13.080> then<00:05:13.259> as<00:05:13.439> it<00:05:13.680> rolls<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.490> taking<00:05:14.969> up

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:15.089 
and then as it rolls is taking up

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.119 
and then as it rolls is taking up
alignment<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.110> in<00:05:16.199> misalignment<00:05:16.830> with<00:05:16.979> the

background<00:05:17.879> lines<00:05:19.129> simple<00:05:20.129> one<00:05:20.249> but<00:05:20.370> nice<00:05:20.550> and

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
full of kite itself doesn't come with it

full of kite itself doesn't come with it
it<00:05:26.639> was<00:05:26.729> a<00:05:26.759> kite<00:05:26.999> handy<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.449> I<00:05:27.509> wanted<00:05:27.779> this

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
the packaging threw it around around but

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.149 
the packaging threw it around around but
the<00:05:32.819> fundus<00:05:33.270> was<00:05:33.479> this<00:05:33.689> handle<00:05:34.229> which<00:05:34.649> came<00:05:34.919> I
