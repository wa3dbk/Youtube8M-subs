00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.490 
here and the plants corn roots you know
it<00:00:36.900> gives<00:00:37.140> them<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.650> big<00:00:38.720> trough<00:00:39.720> to<00:00:40.019> feed<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it gives them a big trough to feed in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.340 
it gives them a big trough to feed in
instead<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.980> hunting<00:00:41.250> around<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.730> their<00:00:42.059> food

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
everything arranged go ahead and use a

regular drive on it got it all

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
regular drive on it got it all
calibrated<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:17.759> doing<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
calibrated and it really is doing the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
calibrated and it really is doing the
job<00:01:18.450> working<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> ground<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.380> beautiful<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
job working the ground up beautiful it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.609 
job working the ground up beautiful it
just<00:01:20.099> opens<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.849> last<00:01:21.750> year<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.259> got<00:01:22.410> me

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
just opens it up last year it got me

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.080 
just opens it up last year it got me
planted<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.280> mid-april<00:01:25.280> instead<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.640> had<00:01:26.940> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
planted in mid-april instead of I had to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510 
planted in mid-april instead of I had to
finish<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.660> May<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.440> around<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.429> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
finish in May which around here would it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.089 
finish in May which around here would it
cost<00:01:29.670> me<00:01:29.880> about<00:01:30.090> 40<00:01:30.420> bushel<00:01:30.810> an<00:01:30.869> acre<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
cost me about 40 bushel an acre so that

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.650 
cost me about 40 bushel an acre so that
gives<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.399> all<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.670> advantages<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.300> Ellie

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
gives me all the advantages that Ellie

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.809 
gives me all the advantages that Ellie
Jo<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.289> ground<00:01:34.530> drying<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> loose<00:01:35.429> and

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
Jo at the ground drying and loose and

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.940 
Jo at the ground drying and loose and
warming<00:01:36.690> up<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.319> clay<00:01:37.619> soils<00:01:38.099> are<00:01:38.280> cool

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
warming up on these clay soils are cool

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
warming up on these clay soils are cool
so<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.130> basically<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.970> reason<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.660> it<00:01:42.810> I

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so that's basically the reason for it I

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
so that's basically the reason for it I
also<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.800> that's<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> other<00:01:44.160> reason<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
also then and that's the other reason I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.790 
also then and that's the other reason I
run<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.209> the<00:01:45.330> spring<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:46.020> lot<00:01:46.440> of<00:01:46.500> times

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
run it in the spring a lot of times

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.010 
run it in the spring a lot of times
right<00:01:47.009> ahead<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.520> planter<00:01:47.940> maybe<00:01:48.660> an<00:01:48.840> hour

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
right ahead of the planter maybe an hour

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.940 
right ahead of the planter maybe an hour
to<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.890> couple<00:01:50.250> days<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.940> week<00:01:51.780> fine<00:01:52.229> whatever

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to a couple days a week fine whatever

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.520 
to a couple days a week fine whatever
my<00:01:53.459> soils<00:01:53.910> roll<00:01:54.209> a<00:01:54.239> little<00:01:54.599> bit<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.289> not

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
my soils roll a little bit so I do not

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.309 
my soils roll a little bit so I do not
want<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.009> early<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.660> get<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.840> erosion

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
want to get early and get the erosion

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.900 
want to get early and get the erosion
problems<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.220> reason<00:01:59.489> I've<00:01:59.580> gone<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
problems that's the reason I've gone to

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.300 
problems that's the reason I've gone to
no-till<00:02:00.239> and<00:02:00.330> cover<00:02:00.539> crops<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.160> want

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
no-till and cover crops so I don't want

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
no-till and cover crops so I don't want
to<00:02:02.369> defeat<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> purpose<00:02:03.420> well<00:02:03.989> it's<00:02:04.259> got<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to defeat that purpose well it's got a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.910 
to defeat that purpose well it's got a
straight<00:02:05.220> cutter<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.020> cut<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
straight cutter just to cut all the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219 
straight cutter just to cut all the
stalks<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.489> fodder<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.690> roots<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
stalks and fodder and the roots and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.190 
stalks and fodder and the roots and
stuff<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> run<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> mole<00:02:12.060> knife<00:02:12.360> with

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
stuff and then I run a mole knife with

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.320 
stuff and then I run a mole knife with
an<00:02:13.319> inch<00:02:13.530> tube<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.160> dry<00:02:14.400> fertilizer<00:02:14.970> on

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
an inch tube for the dry fertilizer on

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.770 
an inch tube for the dry fertilizer on
it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.949 
it
I've<00:02:16.590> got<00:02:16.920> disc<00:02:17.280> sealers<00:02:17.849> which<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.629> pull

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
I've got disc sealers which just pull

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.630 
I've got disc sealers which just pull
the<00:02:19.080> dirt<00:02:19.260> back<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.800> hump<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.190> little<00:02:20.370> bit

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the dirt back and hump it a little bit

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.100 
the dirt back and hump it a little bit
and<00:02:20.940> then<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.580> fashioned<00:02:23.580> some<00:02:23.910> crumb<00:02:24.540> blurs<00:02:24.840> I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and then I fashioned some crumb blurs I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
and then I fashioned some crumb blurs I
guess<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> best<00:02:25.650> word<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> call<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.490> dries

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
guess the best word to call it dries

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.730 
guess the best word to call it dries
some<00:02:26.970> wheels<00:02:27.270> with<00:02:27.390> some<00:02:27.540> bars<00:02:27.750> across<00:02:28.140> -<00:02:28.500> just

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the back which is necessary because of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.950 
the back which is necessary because of
running<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.790> right<00:02:32.820> ahead<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.420> planner
