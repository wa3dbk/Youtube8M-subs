00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.899 
you would open it up and show you what's
inside<00:03:22.230> because<00:03:22.680> i<00:03:22.739> am<00:03:22.980> going<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.430> actually

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
inside because i am going to be actually

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.509 
inside because i am going to be actually
upgrading<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.900> ram<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.830> future<00:03:26.159> so<00:03:26.370> they

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
upgrading the ram in the future so they

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.580 
upgrading the ram in the future so they
would<00:03:26.670> definitely<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.299> video<00:03:27.450> about<00:03:27.959> that

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
would definitely be a video about that

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.130 
would definitely be a video about that
in<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.010> near<00:03:29.129> future<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:30.060> i<00:03:30.360> gotta<00:03:30.659> figure<00:03:30.930> how

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
in the near future so i gotta figure how

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.240
