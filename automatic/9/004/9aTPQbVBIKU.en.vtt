00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.809
 arms of cursed with my nexus 5 and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 installed on it android 5.0 lollipop 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
 I think so far the best update 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.150
 from googles mobile os i am heavy 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.949
 Inspired by matter design by the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 most of the new features 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.670
 You will become the ota by now 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.990
 hopefully have gotten update and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 you try it around and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.769
 its like done to me like that is me 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.630
 days a feature noticed that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.650
 Announced in advance he was from the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.060
 it later but not so large 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.710
 has talked and that the least of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.290
 you should have actually experienced 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 because if its not update then gets 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.660
 you do not set up the device again 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.280
 but you take over her 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.989
 attitude we already had 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.930
 but a new facility is now 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 restore this better app so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.829
 we remember what he so her before 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 have a device to factory new 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.899
 set up and then google the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 place tor relatively arbitrary started 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.020
 times that not all apps have that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.699
 he somehow sit with you in the account 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.899
 has to download partly also over 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.030
 a data connection if not yet 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 wlan have set up or ore time 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.730
 not done and he had to laboriously 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.519
 does it by hand or always stops like that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 So it was relatively annoying the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.250
 the apps restore you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.650
 ever saved that is now 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.299
 got better under 50 and I would 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.799
 like to show you what it looks like now 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.450
 if it just has not experienced 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 have a turn and we'll have a look 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.280
 on the furnishing screen 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 we are on the startscreen 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 setup under android 5.0 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.930
 I'll honestly see to her that too 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.189
 of course, I have it here, of course 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.360
 already partially set up namely 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.280
 the wlan ever and mine 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.390
 google account associated with it without that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.829
 That's not what I'll do to you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 show I did not want to be so tedious 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.130
 here in the video elves long passwords 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.680
 Enter why I have this before 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.210
 done so and choose language 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.549
 German is clear 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 So now the connection searches 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.180
 still fast after updates account 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 added that was what I was 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.520
 ever added my standard 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.950
 account then I go on and on 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.299
 now we are at the point apps and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.740
 retrieve data so what you maybe 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.100
 Also we know the device also per 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.329
 online update update has is this nfc 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.130
 Facility means that you can enter 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.899
 other device that is capable of nfc on the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.880
 account and maybe wlan data on it 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.200
 are on the back then keep that over 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.369
 then he will take over 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.039
 but it is specifically about the apps and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.280
 now you can see here two entries and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.170
 although once 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.310
 restore this security and there 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.370
 are now different devices 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.569
 listed so these are devices 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.030
 constellations that I used last 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.620
 I have not just been there 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.540
 So here are lollipop devices 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.270
 a few test equipment for example 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.319
 that's the seven I tested 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.410
 a few weeks 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.330
 that's here i think the xperia z3 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.030
 that i tested but the shield tablet 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.470
 I do not know what this xt can do 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.930
 I'm just saying nexus 9 right now 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 trainer the yogurt tablet to 3 me 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.900
 Of course, that would be me now 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.130
 for the nexus five that is for last 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.480
 used this morning before I did the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.610
 now comes in extra for the video here 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.709
 I have reset again then I choose that 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.780
 so I can do that but I can 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.700
 take it easy and have it now 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.690
 But I also the possibility 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.120
 all apps are now again 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.730
 would be prepared to pick 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.780
 So I can say for example the has 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.069
 is losing so now that was natural 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.709
 my apps that I had on it 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.300
 but i am already google well talkback 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.680
 I do not want that or with 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.200
 I really want to have it already 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.430
 I'll take spiderman unlimited that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.329
 I do not play here I need that 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.910
 not at all then I had here 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.989
 recently his son adventure 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.950
 Not that anyone played here 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.079
 does not train 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.640
 works under lollipop and then 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.579
 I'll finish and then he would 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.720
 now is now liberally to continue now 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.040
 yes the thing with the google 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.160
 Of course, everything will come 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.150
 so now makes one more time around google 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.470
 nokia also download from me 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.120
 so now the recovery is going on 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.040
 lasts now the whole moment goes by 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.290
 then sometime in the normal 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.780
 home screen mode in and then you see 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.380
 yes I should have the upper run because of that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.910
 please activate it all the time 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.530
 and now you see this up here now 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.850
 is the usual why experienced before 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.440
 now over the place tor all this 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.700
 apps down but just the ones i do 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.049
 also told him to download 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.600
 should and i am definitely too 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.910
 Already in the wlan so that clearly 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.400
 more practical than it was before 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.220
 android 4.4 still the case was a good one 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.739
 feature of lollipop works that way 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.870
 So restore the apps below 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.250
 android 5.0 lollipop very much 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.019
 more comfortable as I think 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.070
 clearly not quite optimal so nice 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.360
 Of course it would also be 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.980
 if somehow the settings or 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.750
 your progress will be saved there 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.000
 that would not be so 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.800
 At least you can choose which ones in advance 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.480
 apps then come back and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.380
 that also devices different and 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.090
 make specific 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.260
 very practical step into the right one 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.610
 direction i am glad if you can 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.080
 feature also finds cool and also this 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.670
 video is good then bows his yet 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.720
 partly with your friends the 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.070
 maybe not seen 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.800
 subscribed to our channel then missed 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.150
 no news about android 5 and also about all 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.260
 the other mobile topics we do 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.370
 Of course, you always serve and read 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.900
 he forces everything there 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.080
 detailed article until then 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.080
 bye
