is his car and we're gonna do a drag
build<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.840> there's<00:00:40.290> no<00:00:40.410> point<00:00:40.620> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
build on it because there's no point in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.900 
build on it because there's no point in
a<00:00:40.800> drift<00:00:40.950> build<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a drift build on it because we know that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
a drift build on it because we know that
DOM<00:00:42.329> didn't<00:00:42.629> drift<00:00:42.840> even<00:00:43.500> though<00:00:43.559> he<00:00:43.710> beat

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
DOM didn't drift even though he beat

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.360

well<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.920> basically<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> normal<00:00:50.610> charger

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
well this is basically a normal charger

wing about as big as an actual plane on
the<00:01:05.670> back<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.330> original<00:01:06.720> idea<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.049> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the back now my original idea for this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
the back now my original idea for this
car<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> huge<00:01:08.430> wheelie<00:01:08.820> build

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
car was to do a huge wheelie build

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
car was to do a huge wheelie build
because<00:01:09.240> obviously<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.200> dominic

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
because obviously you know dominic

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.780 
because obviously you know dominic
toretto<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.010> known<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.310> doing<00:01:11.520> massive

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
toretto is known for doing massive

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
toretto is known for doing massive
wheelies<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.840> absolutely<00:01:13.409> no<00:01:13.619> regard<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
wheelies with absolutely no regard in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.060 
wheelies with absolutely no regard in
terms<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.729> physics<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.229> couldn't<00:01:16.890> make<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
terms of physics but I couldn't make it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.760 
terms of physics but I couldn't make it
do<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> wheelie<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.960> respectively

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
do a wheelie at all like respectively

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.109 
do a wheelie at all like respectively
anyway<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.040> couldn't<00:01:20.280> make<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> standing

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
anyway I couldn't make it do a standing

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.100 
anyway I couldn't make it do a standing
really<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> don't<00:01:21.570> wanna<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> those

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
really I don't wanna do one of those

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
really I don't wanna do one of those
bounce<00:01:22.470> wheelie<00:01:22.890> Tunes<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.460> are

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
bounce wheelie Tunes because they are

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
bounce wheelie Tunes because they are
just<00:01:23.700> stupid<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.080> look<00:01:25.259> dumb<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
yeah I couldn't do that so I was like
okay<00:01:27.810> let's<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> drug<00:01:28.560> bill<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:28.950> that's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
okay let's do a drug bill because that's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.679 
okay let's do a drug bill because that's
what<00:01:29.250> Dominic<00:01:29.549> Toro<00:01:29.759> also<00:01:30.119> does<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.479> yeah

without<00:01:31.200> further<00:01:31.350> ado<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.520> should

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
without further ado I think we should

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
without further ado I think we should
get<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> gap<00:01:33.090> okay<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.200> things

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
get to the gap okay so first things

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
get to the gap okay so first things
first<00:01:36.110> okay<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.790> things<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.060> we're

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
first okay so first things first we're

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
first okay so first things first we're
gonna<00:01:39.479> change<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.990> engine<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829

produce<00:01:42.540> enough<00:01:42.810> horsepower<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.829> 669

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
produce enough horsepower it's like 669

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
produce enough horsepower it's like 669
horsepower<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.840> yeah<00:01:46.229> we're<00:01:46.380> gonna<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.710> that

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.210 
gonna put speed up but have more because
they<00:04:04.260> seem<00:04:04.470> very<00:04:04.500> short

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
they seem very short

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.860 
they seem very short
now<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.549> alignment<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.150> absolutely<00:04:06.540> fine<00:04:06.660> you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
now the alignment is absolutely fine you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.120 
now the alignment is absolutely fine you
don't<00:04:06.930> even<00:04:07.170> have<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.350> touch<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.739> alignment

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
don't even have to touch the alignment

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.650 
don't even have to touch the alignment
to<00:04:08.220> be<00:04:08.310> honest<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.970> leave<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.299> alignment

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
to be honest I just leave the alignment

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.819 
to be honest I just leave the alignment
as<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.079> don't<00:04:10.140> even<00:04:10.350> know<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:10.620> with<00:04:10.709> it

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
as it is I don't even know to do with it

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.560 
as it is I don't even know to do with it
anti-roll<00:04:11.579> bars<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.910> always<00:04:12.060> put<00:04:12.180> them<00:04:12.299> up<00:04:12.390> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
anti-roll bars I always put them up the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.360 
anti-roll bars I always put them up the
stiffest<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.109> because<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.650> don't<00:04:14.190> know<00:04:14.250> why

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
stiffest just because I don't know why

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.220 
stiffest just because I don't know why
I'm<00:04:14.670> across<00:04:14.850> it

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
I'm across it

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.650 
I'm across it
now<00:04:17.230> with<00:04:17.380> Springs<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.920> normally<00:04:18.310> put<00:04:18.730> them<00:04:19.030> to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
now with Springs I normally put them to

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.690 
now with Springs I normally put them to
be<00:04:19.780> honest<00:04:20.079> I<00:04:20.200> don't<00:04:20.260> actually<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.250> kind

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
be honest I don't actually have a kind

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.180 
be honest I don't actually have a kind
of<00:04:21.790> recommended<00:04:22.660> thing<00:04:23.230> for<00:04:23.530> Springs<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.010> just

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
of recommended thing for Springs I just

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.520 
of recommended thing for Springs I just
do<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.430> as<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.640> how's<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.480> really<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.350> with

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
do it as I how's it go really so with

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.140 
do it as I how's it go really so with
the<00:04:26.620> front<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:26.950> go<00:04:27.010> low<00:04:27.280> front<00:04:27.610> rear<00:04:27.970> high

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
the front I go low front rear high

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.670 
the front I go low front rear high
because<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.600> makes<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.810> look<00:04:28.900> sick<00:04:29.230> but<00:04:29.410> with

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
because it makes it look sick but with

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.930 
because it makes it look sick but with
this<00:04:29.860> one<00:04:30.040> I'm<00:04:30.160> actually<00:04:30.250> gonna<00:04:30.490> put<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.790> both

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
this one I'm actually gonna put it both

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.400 
this one I'm actually gonna put it both
low<00:04:31.180> because<00:04:31.510> that<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.810> what<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> car<00:04:32.200> looks

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
low because that is what the car looks

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.690 
low because that is what the car looks
like<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.890> film<00:04:33.100> I'm<00:04:33.220> gonna<00:04:33.370> put<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.550> front

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
like in the film I'm gonna put the front

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.160 
like in the film I'm gonna put the front
soft<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.330> wrist<00:04:34.540> if<00:04:34.750> that's<00:04:34.990> what<00:04:35.080> I'm

at<00:04:44.920> drag<00:04:45.070> racing<00:04:45.400> on<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.610> game<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:45.940> don't<00:04:46.180> I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
at drag racing on this game so I don't I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.730 
at drag racing on this game so I don't I
don't<00:04:46.480> know<00:04:46.600> again<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:47.020> rebound<00:04:47.350> sickness

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
don't know again we rebound sickness

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.020 
don't know again we rebound sickness
I've<00:04:47.890> not<00:04:48.160> even<00:04:48.280> touch<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.580> because<00:04:48.790> I<00:04:48.910> don't

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
I've not even touch it because I don't

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.820 
I've not even touch it because I don't
know<00:04:49.090> how<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.240> do<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.510> arrow<00:04:50.020> exactly<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.680> same

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
know how to do it arrow exactly the same

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.110 
know how to do it arrow exactly the same
brakes<00:04:51.100> exactly<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.490> same<00:04:51.640> then<00:04:51.790> I<00:04:51.850> just<00:04:52.000> lock

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
brakes exactly the same then I just lock

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.270 
brakes exactly the same then I just lock
the<00:04:52.240> diff<00:04:52.390> I<00:04:52.540> put<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:52.780> up<00:04:52.870> 200%<00:04:53.680> acceleration

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
the diff I put it up 200% acceleration

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.920 
the diff I put it up 200% acceleration
and<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:54.610> what<00:04:54.730> I<00:04:54.760> do<00:04:54.820> for<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.390> base<00:04:55.600> tune

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
and that is what I do for the base tune

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.230 
and that is what I do for the base tune
the<00:04:56.500> main<00:04:56.800> thing<00:04:57.130> though<00:04:57.340> in<00:04:57.580> terms<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.090> drag

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
the main thing though in terms of drag

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.180 
the main thing though in terms of drag
racing<00:04:58.450> for<00:04:58.750> these<00:04:58.840> cars<00:04:59.110> is<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.590> gearing<00:04:59.800> so

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
racing for these cars is the gearing so

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.710 
racing for these cars is the gearing so
we<00:05:00.370> need<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.580> test<00:05:00.700> out<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:00.970> gears<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.600> when

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
we need to test out the gears and when

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.150 
we need to test out the gears and when
you<00:05:01.780> see<00:05:01.900> how<00:05:01.960> long<00:05:02.140> they<00:05:02.260> are<00:05:02.290> get<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.710> feel<00:05:02.920> get

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
you see how long they are get a feel get

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.260 
you see how long they are get a feel get
a<00:05:03.190> feel<00:05:03.340> for<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.490> power<00:05:03.610> band<00:05:03.850> stuff<00:05:04.120> like

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
a feel for the power band stuff like

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.370 
a feel for the power band stuff like
that<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:04.570> yeah<00:05:04.720> let's<00:05:04.930> have<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.080> look

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.680 

okay<00:05:11.100> so<00:05:11.160> first<00:05:11.730> three<00:05:11.910> gears<00:05:12.090> are<00:05:12.210> extremely

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
okay so first three gears are extremely

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.850 
okay so first three gears are extremely
long<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:13.050> good<00:05:13.200> that's<00:05:13.380> good<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.800> think

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
long that's good that's good and I think

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.500 
long that's good that's good and I think
we<00:05:14.160> might<00:05:14.310> even<00:05:14.340> be<00:05:14.520> able<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.730> hit<00:05:14.850> 200<00:05:15.270> mile<00:05:15.390> an

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
we might even be able to hit 200 mile an

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.300 
we might even be able to hit 200 mile an
hour<00:05:15.600> in<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:16.200> stock<00:05:16.440> tube<00:05:16.710> which<00:05:16.890> is<00:05:16.920> a<00:05:17.160> we're

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
hour in this stock tube which is a we're

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.250 
hour in this stock tube which is a we're
pretty<00:05:17.460> good<00:05:17.550> because<00:05:17.940> we<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.260> 832

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
pretty good because we have 832

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.360 
pretty good because we have 832
horsepower<00:05:19.680> so<00:05:19.800> let's<00:05:19.950> see<00:05:20.040> if<00:05:20.100> we<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.280> get

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
horsepower so let's see if we can get

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.980 
horsepower so let's see if we can get
200<00:05:20.700> mile<00:05:20.820> an<00:05:20.940> hour<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.150> day<00:05:21.180> we<00:05:21.450> can<00:05:21.660> there<00:05:21.900> we

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
200 mile an hour a day we can there we

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.300 
200 mile an hour a day we can there we
go<00:05:22.080> we<00:05:22.230> hit<00:05:22.350> 200<00:05:22.710> mile<00:05:22.800> an<00:05:22.920> hour<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.190> we're

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
go we hit 200 mile an hour and we're

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.340 
go we hit 200 mile an hour and we're
still<00:05:23.580> going<00:05:23.760> we're<00:05:23.970> still<00:05:24.120> going<00:05:24.270> strong<00:05:24.480> 209

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
still going we're still going strong 209

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.590 
still going we're still going strong 209
miles<00:05:25.650> an<00:05:25.800> hour<00:05:25.950> on<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.580> drag<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:27.030> know<00:05:27.240> this<00:05:27.480> is

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
miles an hour on the drag I know this is

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.940 
miles an hour on the drag I know this is
meant<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.780> be<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.930> court<00:05:28.200> more<00:05:28.320> dry<00:05:28.530> car<00:05:28.770> but<00:05:28.890> you

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
meant to be a court more dry car but you

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.140 
meant to be a court more dry car but you
know<00:05:29.040> you've<00:05:29.400> always<00:05:29.550> got<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:29.760> see<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.000> top

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
know you've always got to see the top

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.130 
know you've always got to see the top
speed<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.480> these<00:05:30.540> cars<00:05:30.810> because<00:05:31.020> they're

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
speed of these cars because they're

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.200 
speed of these cars because they're
pretty<00:05:31.350> quick<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:31.830> yeah<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.670> think<00:05:32.850> we<00:05:32.910> need<00:05:33.150> to

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
pretty quick so yeah I think we need to

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.070 
pretty quick so yeah I think we need to
mess<00:05:33.330> around<00:05:33.420> with<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.660> gears<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:33.990> then

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
mess around with the gears and then

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.690 
mess around with the gears and then
we're<00:05:34.230> pretty<00:05:34.380> much<00:05:34.530> set<00:05:34.800> okay<00:05:35.280> so<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.430> missed

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
we're pretty much set okay so I missed

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.770 
we're pretty much set okay so I missed
around<00:05:35.880> with<00:05:36.000> tuned<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.330> little<00:05:36.360> bit<00:05:36.600> of<00:05:36.690> mess

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
around with tuned a little bit of mess

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.030 
around with tuned a little bit of mess
around<00:05:36.900> with<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.140> gears<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.650> we're<00:05:37.800> gonna<00:05:37.890> go

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
around with the gears and we're gonna go

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.950 
around with the gears and we're gonna go
for<00:05:38.190> one<00:05:38.370> more<00:05:38.400> run<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.240> see<00:05:39.480> if<00:05:39.540> we<00:05:39.660> can<00:05:39.780> top

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
for one more run and see if we can top

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.810 
for one more run and see if we can top
that<00:05:39.990> 209<00:05:40.620> mile<00:05:40.800> an<00:05:40.890> hour<00:05:40.980> top<00:05:41.190> speed<00:05:41.220> again

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
that 209 mile an hour top speed again

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.800 
that 209 mile an hour top speed again
with<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.060> know<00:05:42.120> this<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.480> supposed<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.690> be<00:05:42.750> a
