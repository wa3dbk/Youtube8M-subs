00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.029
 welcome to the new video of the super 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.160
 end 94 in this video to teach to 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.260
 place your video camera in a 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.810
 handlebar of a bicycle in this case 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.309
 It would be like replacing something pro or 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.970
 any other 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.849
 and so you should not spend 200 or 300 euros on 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.890
 the work and have the same result but 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.140
 more under the inspiration of the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.660
 materials that need the material that 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.789
 you need is a reflective bike 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.250
 with a handlebar adapter a 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.530
 screwdriver hammer screw 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.410
 tripod adapted for all cameras 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.559
 and a drill the first thing we're going to 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.140
 make is with the drill make a hole 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.480
 in the part where there is no ring for 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.129
 the handlebar will be ring is right on the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.710
 medium and you can not see a hole in the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.869
 center do it on the one hand to 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.250
 then we take the hammer and 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.250
 we take out the part of the remaining 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 the reflective practical was highlighted 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.220
 we will see what we have left a hole that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350
 here we will pass the screw now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.750
 organize your fados the video camera 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.330
 the support and entertaining for cameras 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.380
 tripod and now we will go to ride it in the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.380
 handlebar of the mission 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.770
 what we have to do 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.840
 on the handlebar with the hole towards 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.470
 we are fine as more but 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.310
 it has less vibrations you will have a lot 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.310
 stronger than we can 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.649
 we tighten well there are some designs that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.329
 they let out the top cover and it's where 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have made the hole then this 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.549
 it would be perfect because we would place the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.500
 screw in the steering wheel hole 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.469
 as long as it stands out that we had the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.119
 Inning camera we would look after helping 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.450
 with a screwdriver so that it is 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.420
 well fastened to prevent vibrations 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.100
 we really put it and once everything has 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.100
 hung up let's see how it looks 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.220
 so far the video remembers I like 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.590
 comment that if I upload this channel to 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.830

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.830
