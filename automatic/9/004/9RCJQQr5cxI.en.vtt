hey<00:00:12.450> what's<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.750> everybody<00:00:13.019> big<00:00:13.200> jiggly's

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
hey what's on everybody big jiggly's

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
hey what's on everybody big jiggly's
here<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.070> want<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> go<00:00:14.429> over<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.969> mesh

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
here and I want to go over the mesh

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.660 
here and I want to go over the mesh
concept<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.199> how<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.410> applies<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.680> Madden<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
concept and how it applies to Madden and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.730 
concept and how it applies to Madden and
you'll<00:00:18.119> notice<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> play<00:00:19.350> set<00:00:19.560> up

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you'll notice that with this play set up

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980 
you'll notice that with this play set up
you<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.100> double<00:00:20.730> shallow<00:00:21.000> cross<00:00:21.420> patterns

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
you have double shallow cross patterns

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.140 
you have double shallow cross patterns
and<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.890> creates<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> mesh<00:00:23.430> point<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:24.060> you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
and that creates a mesh point when you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.460 
and that creates a mesh point when you
come<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> center<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> field<00:00:25.230> where

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
come to the center of the field where

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.140 
come to the center of the field where
the<00:00:25.560> linebackers<00:00:26.099> play<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.699> will<00:00:26.880> cause<00:00:27.000> one

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
the linebackers play this will cause one

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.400 
the linebackers play this will cause one
of<00:00:27.240> those<00:00:27.359> linebackers<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.170> choose<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
of those linebackers to have to choose a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
of those linebackers to have to choose a
receiver<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> cover<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.460> well<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.539> flat

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
receiver to cover as well as the flat

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.569 
receiver to cover as well as the flat
patterns<00:00:31.289> will<00:00:31.470> pull<00:00:31.679> out<00:00:31.859> any<00:00:32.040> buzz<00:00:32.340> zones

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
patterns will pull out any buzz zones

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
patterns will pull out any buzz zones
creating<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.270> vacant<00:00:33.690> area<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> field

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
creating a vacant area in the field

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
creating a vacant area in the field
right<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.610> we're<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> run<00:00:36.059> this

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
right here now we're going to run this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.549 
right here now we're going to run this
play<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> tube<00:00:36.960> back<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
play out of the tube back we're going to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
play out of the tube back we're going to
see<00:00:37.680> how<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.160> translates<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.910> Madden<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
see how this translates to Madden so the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200 
see how this translates to Madden so the
mesh<00:00:40.260> concept<00:00:40.800> typically<00:00:41.640> works<00:00:41.910> best

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
mesh concept typically works best

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
mesh concept typically works best
against<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.719> cover<00:00:42.989> three<00:00:43.410> against<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> cover

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
against a cover three against the cover

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
against a cover three against the cover
to<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.850> most<00:00:45.120> often<00:00:45.360> would<00:00:45.750> hit<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:45.989> corner

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to you most often would hit that corner

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
to you most often would hit that corner
ball<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.399> far<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.670> cover<00:00:47.820> three<00:00:48.030> girls<00:00:48.210> we're

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
ball as far as cover three girls we're

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
ball as far as cover three girls we're
going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> try<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> use<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.989> mesh<00:00:49.260> concept<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going to try to use this mesh concept in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
going to try to use this mesh concept in
notice<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.360> flat<00:00:51.840> routes<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.440> pull<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
notice that the flat routes do pull the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
create space we're having a little bit

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.670 
create space we're having a little bit
of<00:00:57.420> an<00:00:57.539> issue<00:00:57.690> getting<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.379> linebackers

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of an issue getting these linebackers

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
of an issue getting these linebackers
confused<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.329> far<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.780> mesh<00:01:00.960> point

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
confused so as far as the mesh point

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.330 
confused so as far as the mesh point
goes<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> middle<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> field<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
goes in the middle of the field it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
goes in the middle of the field it
doesn't<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.730> translate<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.390> madden<00:01:03.809> but

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
doesn't really translate to madden but

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.479 
doesn't really translate to madden but
we<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.769> use<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.040> flat<00:01:05.309> round

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
we can do here is use these flat round

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
we can do here is use these flat round
patterns<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.450> pull<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.380> sideline<00:01:07.860> defenders

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
patterns to pull the sideline defenders

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
patterns to pull the sideline defenders
to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> outside<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.030> create<00:01:09.689> space<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
to the outside and create space in

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.289 
to the outside and create space in
between<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> numbers<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> hashes<00:01:12.180> are

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
between the numbers and the hashes are

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
between the numbers and the hashes are
just<00:01:12.540> outside<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> tackle<00:01:13.409> box<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.860> we're

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just outside the tackle box and we're

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070 
just outside the tackle box and we're
going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> use<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.909> play<00:01:15.119> verticals<00:01:15.689> from<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
going to use to play verticals from the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to use to play verticals from the
bunch<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:16.860> gonna<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.280> you're

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
bunch and what we're gonna do is you're

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
bunch and what we're gonna do is you're
running<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> flat<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
running back on a flat and put be on a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
running back on a flat and put be on a
slant<00:01:19.619> over<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> middle<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.909> flat<00:01:21.210> pattern

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
slant over the middle the flat pattern

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
slant over the middle the flat pattern
is<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> pull<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> sideline<00:01:23.220> defender

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is going to pull the sideline defender

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
is going to pull the sideline defender
to<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> outside<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.110> slant<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
to the outside the slant is going to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.969 
to the outside the slant is going to
keep<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> middle<00:01:26.759> defender<00:01:27.299> down<00:01:27.630> now<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
keep the middle defender down now it's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.530 
keep the middle defender down now it's
going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> cause<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.670> middle<00:01:29.939> defender<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
going to cause that middle defender to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
going to cause that middle defender to
have<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.079> cover<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> whole<00:01:31.650> lot<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> ground<00:01:32.250> as

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
have to cover a whole lot of ground as

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.480 
have to cover a whole lot of ground as
the<00:01:33.390> sideline<00:01:34.229> defender<00:01:34.680> gets<00:01:34.920> pulled<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the sideline defender gets pulled out to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
the sideline defender gets pulled out to
the<00:01:35.610> sideline<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.360> creates<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.350> huge<00:01:37.770> space

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the sideline and creates a huge space

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.069 
the sideline and creates a huge space
for<00:01:38.520> us<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> throw<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> ball<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> middle

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
for us to throw the ball in the middle
