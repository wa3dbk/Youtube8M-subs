 the names and g80 titan we have it here 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.430
 even though it should be immediately 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.840
 to be honest we don't have it yet 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.760
 extensively tested 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.200
 this is real glasses so and thus 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.820
 prototype what we have here and 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.080
 not everything is completely peak of yours 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.700
 be with this model 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.980
 so it is a we can already do well 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.520
 see what this is going to be in it's super 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.410
 special 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.510
 You can see it right away, really 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.250
 mechanical keyboard in a loop too 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.040
 it's a bit like having a laptop 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.690
 a year ago looks 25 or 20 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.100
 yes from that very first to that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.450
 very first laptops that just look real 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.130
 for those in that way those suitcases true 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.420
 you took the next keyboard from 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.890
 yes, but then a reasonable one 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.970
 good devices that put it green here 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.280
 seemed green 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.750
 normal keyboard in it and we that me 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.610
 in the desktop world we see every one 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.840
 self-respecting game in it 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.640
 nowadays works around a mechanical 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.720
 have thought about a keyboard and a visor 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.100
 let's just live in the laptop 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.710
 yes in itself is a very creative idea 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.030
 as you see it works oh look at this 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.619
 is just a thick notebook so 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.300
 it's not the most compact 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.640
 model what you what you what you against 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.289
 may come he worked and also weighs 4.5 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.550
 kilos and I am not talking about the 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.319
 doctor should bring you always 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.610
 Drag how this little piece of type 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.649
 machines that don't last very long on a battery 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.840
 keep his stable better soon one 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.490
 kilo or six min shanghai it's not 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.830
 light and compact but yes you have it 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.369
 really a powerhouse is owned 2 GTX 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.750
 980 m in oil in this machine 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.670
 that again you come with a fat one 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.470
 quad core i7 core processor they live one 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.209
 number of different models and then 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.590
 a stack is this with an old one 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.140
 disk yes this is just a powerhouse 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.450
 yes and then it's called the official laptop 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.800
 actually this is just a portable 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.569
 computer that would really just be one 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.979
 better name will yes yes ok I have to 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.240
 say kick when you look at the to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.560
 the design of the keyboard 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.789
 will actually sounds very good 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.929
 mechanical keyboard misses me 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.190
 actually a bit and you can see that 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.450
 that also with most notebooks 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.310
 you see that you see that of course 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.080
 there was a bit of peace under sister 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.580
 thing actually 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 they are standard delivered with a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.730
 extra packages almost sit one 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.170
 kind of yes it seems a bit like his 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.849
 nevertheless animals you know what you both are for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.209
 a front door stops what you can do for that 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.980
 to lay 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.870
 but normally in loose mechanical 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.099
 keyboard that that state too often 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.860
 a bit slanted and that seems to you 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.150
 they would be the nivel a lot lower at the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.440
 So let's say yes you still have one 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.340
 number and and hair done 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.690
 we actually had them maybe 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.220
 have to go one step further and that 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.810
 idea that you just left with that one 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.580
 very first computers that the thing 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.900
 was detachable than would have 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.190
 maybe just a little bit comfortable 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 was then that some news 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.150
 from the other hand i gamers on one 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.920
 normal laptop should now actually 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.230
 all over that front part 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.640
 totally the touchpad that is for 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.780
 gamers and I don't practice at all but 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.490
 often you can do that through sport 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.020
 certainly also switch off gaming notebooks 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.790
 and then you still have the whole part 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.530
 you before you so that is something 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.180
 what thick through the that you have to dodge too 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.130
 an extra yes you still have to be an animal 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.690
 go take it in your bag 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.030
 which is also funny in that power pack 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.240
 what they do at livers that you do too 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.860
 the dsd could test it in gold 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.600
 supplied with that choice of white and 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.070
 Then you can if you put your golden teeth 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.000
 you can place you in it and a 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.760
 handy mouse pad 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.220
 yes after keyboard has been recreated in 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.570
 collaboration with sensei and steelseries 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.190
 cherry target he is he too 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.870
 clearly in the salt even so what 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.870
 that is really mechanical and also with 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.430
 the switches of the well-known brand 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.950
 yes they have room here so over there 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.750
 we come across the dragon we see again 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.790
 in audio so it is up to the spacers 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.880
 also thought yes and you are then twice 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.959
 gtx 980 m in sli 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.970
 I would have thought we could see them 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.800
 it is a laptop or go around 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.390
 bit the toughest thing you can do graphically 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.160
 violence can get yes and look like you 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.870
 also see how that is built in 2m x and 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.340
 tickets here there is one here there 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.989
 one yes and then of course one 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.090
 very big cool profile year it 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.709
 is very little counter in laptops 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390
 yes and or he tall and they don't bridge so too 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.360
 see yes yes they had to get him somewhere there 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.860
 lost of course yes now it's a place 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.670
 and a bit of a trend on a high end 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.350
 laptops 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.060
 screens with high resolution 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.830
 stop with an extra high resolution that 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.360
 did not do msi maybe to 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.830
 avoid looking all the way expensive 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.720
 but also very honest d mark 4k 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.550
 resolution so that is just with desktop 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.320
 card tile not possible let alone with 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.530
 laptop cards so the green is full hd 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.030
 and and with 2 gtx 980 m sin athlete must 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.500
 your full hd although we have not tested 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.760
 But you should expect something like that 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.870
 nice frame zipper he can pick up 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.400
 in addition, of course, is true 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.900
 connection options at the rear 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.850
 sit sit there sit more than 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.980
 sufficient two times mini display port and 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.810
 also an HDMI connection so one 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.220
 Connecting an external display screen is externally 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.810
 also no problem whatsoever, very funny 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.669
 is to see that here is also one 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.230
 full optical connection to the 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.780
 I sit on the side 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.150
 we caught it here so keep one 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.710
 audio connection talk about yes so yes in terms of 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.240
 so you also have connection options 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.370
 really he tom if you say yes i 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.990
 have a nice setup at home well you can 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 Immediately connect Maria and again 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.760
 is an optical drive 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.890
 We no longer see that today 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.790
 his story even blu ray yes so yes but 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.640
 it may of course be for it 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.370
 has a starting price of 34 199 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.200
 euro and that goes to 4639 euro for the 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.460
 most expensive version yes but for the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.830
 Clarity earned even that 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.050
 entry version visitor to mention of 34 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.910
 100 more euros that already has that me 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.530
 find 980 you in that regard pink that 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.790
 also as the most interesting implementation 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.500
 from a set and you get a block 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.850
 the power pack with, among other things 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.530
 that makes you what you are there for you 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.000
 lay for the money that you will get 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.530
 well tempered by our friend of m 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.990
 maybe yes we are already beginning that he is there 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.990
 so issue arrived soon 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.660
 belgium days week in yes of course as 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.350
 He actually passed positive phase 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.760
 is 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.130
 we get more again at that time 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.110
 will of course also extensively test 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.300
 so far in heart for TV for today 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.750
 we go to every monday wednesday and 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.430
 Friday 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.410
 thanks for looking and see you 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.680
 next time 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.700
 is like on the hottest card of style 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.350
 or level on the map that during the 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.240
 gaming is the hottest job 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.140
 fans not affected so normal 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.880
 you would say 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.130
 you never want the dirkje caliber card 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.410
 put some flavors into an htpc 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.210
 but as long as you are busy with it 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.070
 you make a whole purpose of use in a PC 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.300
 no relied at all and that makes it 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.300
 gtx 960 much more
