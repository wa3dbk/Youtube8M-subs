00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
track system for bindings just two

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.540 
track system for bindings just two
connectors<00:00:29.380> on<00:00:29.619> each<00:00:29.740> side<00:00:29.980> of<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.160> binding

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
connectors on each side of the binding

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.470 
connectors on each side of the binding
it's<00:00:30.970> really<00:00:31.300> easy<00:00:31.450> to<00:00:31.660> set<00:00:31.869> up

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
it's really easy to set up

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680 
it's really easy to set up
it's<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.080> Burton<00:00:35.350> hero<00:00:35.530> 158<00:00:36.280> it<00:00:36.910> it's<00:00:37.570> a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
it's a the Burton hero 158 it it's a

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's a the Burton hero 158 it it's a
board<00:00:37.930> that<00:00:38.080> has<00:00:38.199> V<00:00:38.440> rocker<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.040> so<00:00:39.340> it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
board that has V rocker to it so it

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.189 
board that has V rocker to it so it
comes<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.879> kind<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.210> point<00:00:40.510> comes<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.170> a

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
comes to kind of a point comes to a

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.260 
comes to kind of a point comes to a
distinct<00:00:41.620> point<00:00:41.800> right<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.280> middle<00:00:42.430> so<00:00:42.670> it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
distinct point right in the middle so it

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.290 
distinct point right in the middle so it
makes<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.570> really<00:00:43.870> stable<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.970> it's<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.059> board

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
makes it really stable and it's a board

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.689 
makes it really stable and it's a board
that<00:00:46.570> could<00:00:47.290> be<00:00:47.470> recommended<00:00:48.160> to<00:00:48.309> just<00:00:48.519> about

the park and have fun anywhere so yeah

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.440 
the park and have fun anywhere so yeah
it<00:01:18.100> was<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.340> was<00:01:18.460> good<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.640> nice<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.090> was<00:01:19.240> good

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
it was it was good a nice it was good

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.920 
it was it was good a nice it was good
and<00:01:19.570> chop<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.470> Fred<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.190> nasties<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.270> it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
and chop and and Fred and nasties and it

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.679 
and chop and and Fred and nasties and it
would<00:01:23.170> probably<00:01:23.409> ride<00:01:23.770> powder<00:01:24.009> okay<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.359> up

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
would probably ride powder okay the up

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.069 
would probably ride powder okay the up
turn<00:01:26.109> on<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.469> nose<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.310> tail<00:01:27.899> there's<00:01:28.899> not<00:01:29.049> a

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
turn on the nose and tail there's not a

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.230 
turn on the nose and tail there's not a
lot<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.469> it's<00:01:29.590> pretty<00:01:29.799> flat<00:01:30.039> so<00:01:30.969> it

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
lot of it it's pretty flat so it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.859 
lot of it it's pretty flat so it
actually<00:01:31.899> does<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:33.210> nose<00:01:34.210> press<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.689> tail

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
actually does like nose press the tail

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.840 
actually does like nose press the tail
presses<00:01:35.170> manual<00:01:35.829> dollies<00:01:36.189> fairly<00:01:36.520> well<00:01:36.640> I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
presses manual dollies fairly well I

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.209 
presses manual dollies fairly well I
think<00:01:36.969> these<00:01:37.240> boards<00:01:37.509> handled<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.869> best<00:01:38.219> on

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
think these boards handled the best on

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.149 
think these boards handled the best on
the<00:01:40.179> jumps<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.079> pipe<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.649> know<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.770> I

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
the jumps and in the pipe you know I I

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.370 
the jumps and in the pipe you know I I
got<00:01:42.640> more<00:01:42.880> air<00:01:43.030> out<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.990> them<00:01:44.109> than<00:01:44.259> I've

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
got more air out of them than I've

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.429 
got more air out of them than I've
gotten<00:01:44.740> out<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.159> other<00:01:45.250> boards<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:47.409> know

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
gotten out of other boards and you know

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.440 
gotten out of other boards and you know
they<00:01:47.590> felt<00:01:47.770> steady<00:01:48.130> going<00:01:48.399> into<00:01:49.359> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
they felt steady going into the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.179 
they felt steady going into the
transition<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.170> off<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.439> jump<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:50.829> also<00:01:51.100> in

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
transition and off the jump and also in

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.709 
transition and off the jump and also in
the<00:01:51.249> landing<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.820> carving<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.359> the<00:01:52.479> powder

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
the landing the carving and the powder

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.950 
the landing the carving and the powder
was<00:01:53.049> phenomenal<00:01:53.979> edge<00:01:54.399> that<00:01:55.390> edge<00:01:55.420> control

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
was phenomenal edge that edge control

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.919 
was phenomenal edge that edge control
was<00:01:56.229> great<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.759> reverse<00:01:58.060> camber<00:01:58.390> kept<00:01:58.810> it

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
was great the reverse camber kept it

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.899 
was great the reverse camber kept it
afloat<00:01:59.229> really<00:01:59.619> well<00:01:59.799> made<00:02:00.219> riding<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:00.700> even

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
afloat really well made riding and even

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.630 
afloat really well made riding and even
in<00:02:00.999> that<00:02:01.149> heavier<00:02:01.539> powder<00:02:01.869> pretty<00:02:02.259> fun<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.009> I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
in that heavier powder pretty fun and I

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.099 
in that heavier powder pretty fun and I
was<00:02:03.759> surprised<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.119> see<00:02:04.420> how<00:02:04.539> well<00:02:04.719> this<00:02:04.840> board

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
was surprised to see how well this board

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.719 
was surprised to see how well this board
actually<00:02:05.289> did<00:02:05.590> in<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.770> park<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.340> was<00:02:06.460> great<00:02:06.700> on

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
actually did in the park it was great on

you<00:02:18.069> know<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:18.310> fun<00:02:18.460> in<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> park<00:02:19.830> has<00:02:20.830> a

you know it's fun in the park has a
little<00:02:21.220> bit<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.430> flex<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.000> fairly<00:02:22.270> stiff

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
little bit of flex but it's fairly stiff

the spectrum from all the board's that
I've<00:02:36.270> been<00:02:36.390> demoing<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.680> soft<00:02:37.890> enough<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400

chute<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.750> think<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.590> board<00:02:46.800> would<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.220> be
