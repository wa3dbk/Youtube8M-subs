to help our kids and I just didn't

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680 
to help our kids and I just didn't

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
understand what I learned that was most

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.140 
understand what I learned that was most
shocking<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.680> me<00:03:19.830> about<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.820> state<00:03:21.030> of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
shocking to me about the state of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.850 
shocking to me about the state of
research<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.900> country<00:03:22.350> with<00:03:22.500> childhood

research in this country with childhood

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.540 
research in this country with childhood
cancer<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:24.420> there<00:03:25.320> are<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.770> many<00:03:25.950> great

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
cancer is that there are so many great

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.310 
cancer is that there are so many great
doctors<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.210> laboratories<00:03:27.960> out<00:03:28.110> there

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
doctors and laboratories out there

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.800 
doctors and laboratories out there
trying<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.710> find<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.070> answer<00:03:29.430> but<00:03:30.420> they<00:03:30.570> don't

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
trying to find the answer but they don't

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:40.720 
trying to find the answer but they don't
have<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.080> funding<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:32.070> do<00:03:32.280> it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.880 

what<00:03:41.730> also<00:03:41.879> disturbs<00:03:42.689> me<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.170> much<00:03:43.349> about<00:03:43.769> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
what also disturbs me so much about the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.250 
what also disturbs me so much about the
lack<00:03:44.099> of<00:03:44.129> funding<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.629> these<00:03:45.780> kids<00:03:46.049> don't

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
lack of funding is that these kids don't

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.920 
lack of funding is that these kids don't
have<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.890> dying<00:03:47.129> my<00:03:47.909> daughter<00:03:48.180> didn't<00:03:48.750> have

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
have to be dying my daughter didn't have

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:59.270 
have to be dying my daughter didn't have
to<00:03:49.109> die<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:50.250> she<00:03:50.310> did<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.739> more<00:03:58.739> science

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to die but she did we have more science

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.220 
to die but she did we have more science
and<00:03:59.579> more<00:03:59.849> ideas<00:04:00.000> than<00:04:00.239> we<00:04:00.480> could<00:04:00.629> ever<00:04:00.659> pursue

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and more ideas than we could ever pursue

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.009 
and more ideas than we could ever pursue
what<00:04:01.409> we<00:04:01.530> lack<00:04:01.680> his<00:04:01.889> money<00:04:02.510> unravel<00:04:03.510> started

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
what we lack his money unravel started

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.280 
what we lack his money unravel started
with<00:04:04.439> a<00:04:04.739> drawing<00:04:05.159> of<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:06.420> traditional<00:04:06.930> cancer

with a drawing of the traditional cancer
ribbon<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.859> we<00:04:08.609> did<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.790> thread<00:04:09.120> coming<00:04:09.480> off<00:04:09.719> of

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
ribbon and we did a thread coming off of

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.690 
ribbon and we did a thread coming off of
it<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.620> had<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:11.010> thought<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.549> if<00:04:11.669> you

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
it and I had this thought that if you

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.270 
it and I had this thought that if you
can<00:04:12.000> start<00:04:12.299> with<00:04:12.510> these<00:04:12.629> most<00:04:13.109> difficult
