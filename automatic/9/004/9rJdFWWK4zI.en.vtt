 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.220
 let's make some sweet dumplings and 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.950
 for this we are going to need 150 grams 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.400
 chocolate fondant cinnamon powder 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.770
 sugar glass and 6 sheets of dough for 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.430
 empanadillas and the first thing we're going to 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.349
 make will be chopping the chocolate what 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.349
 We cut a little bit too thin 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.940
 then we are going to assemble the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.140
 empanadillas let's put a little bit of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.140
 chocolate in the center 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.310
 and we fold the dough 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.560
 and now with the help of a fork we are going 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.900
 sealing the dough well so that then 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.140
 when the chocolate falls apart, we do not know 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140
 out 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.130
 and we have it ready to fry 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.869
 while we have been riding the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 empanadillas we had the oil to 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.939
 heat we have put sunflower oil 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.130
 and we have it warm to start 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.060
 fry the patties let the casting 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.060
 with careful 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.010
 the strong fire has to be very 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.140
 warm the oil we are going to give you the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.240
 turn everything very carefully so that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.760
 do not break it, we drain it a little bit 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.720
 take it out in the pan and put it on paper 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.210
 absorbent 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.990
 and we repeat the operation with 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.700
 other 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.670
 if we see that it is too hot 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.440
 we can lower the fire a little by 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 Last we are going to donate our 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.390
 dumplings with the help of a colander 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.160
 we're going to sprinkle a little bit of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.820
 icing sugar over our 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.820
 empanadillas 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.450
 now we will throw a little cinnamon with 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.450
 hand 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.510
 and we already have our very rich 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.819
 sweet dumplings ready to eat if 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.790
