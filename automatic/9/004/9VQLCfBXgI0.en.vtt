00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.240
 It is such a place with the fiber from No. 2 to No. 6 in the gross group the most but No. 7 is 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.100
 It is a grime type 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.100

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.609
 It is written in the construction 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.140
 This Kaiserslautern wrote me express the rising and three-dimensional effect 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:53.430
 Well it is the strongest if you are in the fiber system 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 It's a hairy woman who 's a fiber, so it's a bit heavy. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.370
 Fishing is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.989
 I remember that I'm in the philosopher after all in the language of this straight hair and past injustice 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.050
 I think there is a type 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.850
 Here the students of this during the play part is a rather 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.340

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.659
 Big 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:45.470
 Because it is Senma fiber , it is great today 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:48.850
 This summer a little bit of power helped me to have an effect and a strong quick-drying in the water. 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 Let's go why why put this little by little 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.560
 I think that there is better to Yappa been set 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.450

 Wax and black number in one container 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.709
 It's such that it contains 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.970

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:38.670
 It is such a place this time 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:44.400
 Asset power is the sixth, but it feels like there isn't so much 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.860
 The rock band in the middle is a feeling that the set power is high compared to Nakano No. 6 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.950
