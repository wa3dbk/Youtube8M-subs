00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey guys this is told he and this is

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey guys this is told he and this is
going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.580> be<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> rather<00:00:03.300> large<00:00:03.629> channel

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
going to be a rather large channel

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.309 
going to be a rather large channel
update<00:00:05.060> more<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.150> content<00:00:06.629> than<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.020> length

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
update more in content than in length

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.830 
update more in content than in length
because<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.770> like<00:00:08.550> yesha<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.000> had<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> fairly<00:00:09.510> long

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
because I like yesha I had a fairly long

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.299 
because I like yesha I had a fairly long
channel<00:00:10.200> update<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.190> mostly

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
channel update but that was mostly

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.620 
channel update but that was mostly
because<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.849> wasn't<00:00:12.150> really<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.330> channel

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
because it wasn't really a channel

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.940 
because it wasn't really a channel
update<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.049> more<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.290> me<00:00:13.440> playing<00:00:13.740> with
