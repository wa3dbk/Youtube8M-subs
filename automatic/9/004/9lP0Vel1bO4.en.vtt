 I put this ridiculous straw hat 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 and then shorts 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.589
 while we treat them in winter it's 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.240
 to tell you about the character day of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.240

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.130
 first of all for the people you have 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.660
 heard of one piece this is 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.110
 of a manga it was good for non 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.360
 connoisseurs 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.370
 so people over 60 years old the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.900
 cartoon translation into japanese 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.550
 and gold I noticed that the charges 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.140
 pretty much always to grace when we 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.580
 reads a manga it so you to weird where 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.450
 the young book museum during the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.940
 prevails 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.470
 coming back on the wires he so it's 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.239
 of a manga telling the life of the girl 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.580
 and his crew looking for 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.500
 treasures of the famous pirate king golf 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.170
 big heart it's treasure will give then to 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.050
 whoever finds it the title of lord 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.160
 of goods so here are the quests at 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.850
 quebec the girl looks like the countryside 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.530
 by being named the astra see and more 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.009
 precisely the fridge what is it 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.610
 there is good agreement and Mt. 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.960
 fridge or as uno me kind of geek 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.640
 this one gives him the power 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.530
 to cancel all its members like that one 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600
 associates prices of the months it is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.280
 after having less beats we can 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.320
 more to swim 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.299
 Amelia greeted a little annoying when 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.370
 we are cooked we must know that the film 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.470
 a pirate but by a pirate like the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.600
 others a pirate scientist lahouel 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.940
 technal mikami wooden leg is not 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.480
 terminals and in addition they share little 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.490
 near 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.350
 start happened that unfolds in one 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.299
 spiral 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.950
 it's true lichette like craft six 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.659
 machines one is then the trades of the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.640
 pirates 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.210
 wanted by the maboul is put in price 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.600
 risk dying of thirst hunger of the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.830
 plague or even cholera and then if 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.030
 you have eaten a fruit of the demon 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.759
 risks and will have to wet and so awesome 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.950
 that finally we must think that the film is 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.280
 a true that besides the evidence on this 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.380
 picture 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.440
 so that's typically the kind of thing 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.989
 I do not really why 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 because because I get there 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.680
 not here is ah yes again one last 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.350
 thing that one should never pay his 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.850

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.390
