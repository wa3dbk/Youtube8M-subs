00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
Nintendo trying different things with

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.680 
Nintendo trying different things with
their<00:04:24.720> franchises<00:04:25.610> although<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.880> don't<00:04:26.970> want

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
their franchises although I don't want

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.410 
their franchises although I don't want

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
making this a worldstar exclusive so I i

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.140 
making this a worldstar exclusive so I i
ended<00:04:34.890> up<00:04:34.980> pre-ordering<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.700> at<00:04:35.820> bestbuy

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
ended up pre-ordering it at bestbuy

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.530 
ended up pre-ordering it at bestbuy
because<00:04:36.630> i<00:04:36.810> already<00:04:36.990> had<00:04:37.320> thirty<00:04:37.650> dollars<00:04:38.070> off

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
because i already had thirty dollars off

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.210 
because i already had thirty dollars off
due<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.570> gift<00:04:39.900> cards<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.380> gift<00:04:40.620> certificates

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
due to gift cards and gift certificates

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.730 
due to gift cards and gift certificates
so<00:04:41.430> technically<00:04:42.030> Nintendo<00:04:42.990> isn't<00:04:43.320> directly

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
so technically Nintendo isn't directly

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.520 
so technically Nintendo isn't directly
