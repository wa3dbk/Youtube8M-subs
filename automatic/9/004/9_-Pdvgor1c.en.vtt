00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 more blue by the funeral prefix of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 trust you have to deny the smooth path and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.029
 I want to talk about imprudence 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.189
 of alcohol to burn fat and to 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.899
 building muscle tissue like 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.140
 you know sport has become 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.550
 a social factor today after 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 a lot of people drink alcohol and I do not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 I like to drink alcohol on weekends 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 combinative have a good time no no 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.820
 it's not too bad but at the moment 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.059
 that you want to meet your goals 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.679
 for muscular grace or to burn fat 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.980
 that's when in a little bit of effect 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.650
 negative and that can not retard this 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.800
 process 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.930
 as everyone knows alcohol not only 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.480
 has negative effects on the body 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.180
 also as I told you now in the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 muscle building many 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.280
 people believe that if they work that yes 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.010
 they work the muscles all week and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.230
 they feed well all week because the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.870
 weekend nothing happens if you take 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.170
 a little alcohol but then everything 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.150
 it depends on the amount of crap this 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.050
 it's going to be a great effect on your body and 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.229
 in its process the alcohol when ingested 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.390
 it is absorbed with the stomach 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.729
 automatically this is taken as the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.190
 first source of energy without mixing 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.170
 for example with carbohydrates proteins 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.180
 fats that are macronutrients of the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.940
 body for muscle building 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.370
 how is it automatically absorbed 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.160
 all the other processes of the synthesis 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.010
 of proteins or lipolysis are going to be 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.680
 as caused for a moment until 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.950
 alcohol is used 100% by the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.759
 body 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.680
 this process for the body to use 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.439
 all that hard alcohol energy 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.719
 approximately 10 hours although 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.390
 everything depends on the end of the amount of 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.060
 40 alcohol you eat and well this 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.069
 could delay a lot of all these 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.950
 processes and that's what a person who 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.349
 wants to build muscle does not want or 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.080
 what happens if you every week 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.430
 put to the gym all week you 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.519
 feeds is well comes the end of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.860
 week and you go out with your friends Friday and 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.069
 Saturday and drinking alcohol means that 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.489
 Friday, Saturday and a little Sunday, you 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.700
 body will not build muscle 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.010
 necessary with the exercise you did 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.230
 in the days of the week 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.340
 so you know that the muscle 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.769
 the moment that is 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.260
 resting and if Monday to Friday in three 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.090
 Saturday and Sunday want to rest 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.250
 right there you will not be able to regenerate 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.590
 all over the body they have in your mail and 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.840
 the fucking body 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 remember friends who are not only 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.290
 these protein synthesis processes 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.510
 and of disc policies those who are going to 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 delay in the body the alcohol has 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.940
 other negative effects that are low the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.250
 testosterone you have that the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.860
 destruction is the hormone of 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.319
 growth is the one in charge of 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.470
 make your body regenerate that your 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.870
 body go build fabrics and it 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.599
 make bigger naturally too 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.819
 this increases the appetite that is going to 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.709
 make eat much more 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.049
 obviously in you do not want to be 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.129
 eating others if you have yes 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.620
 you want to be a deficit of 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:40.220
 calories can not pass those calories 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.560
 also the cut dehydrates you 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.569
 They also know that water is the most 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.049
 important in the human body the body 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.810
 human being is made about 65% of 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.790
 Water 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.019
 the water is 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.709
 is necessary in processes 100% 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.870
 metabolic of the body so please 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.069
 take into account that alcohol is also 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.560
 high in calories and wants to be a 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.800
 Calorie deficit and drinking alcohol 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.770
 believe me it will never be 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.950
 as I told them when hoisting alcohol also 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.410
 inhibits the burning of fats and also 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.799
 says so to speak to the body we are going to 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.629
 save gas 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.849
 and I believe that none of these aspects 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.980
 are the ones you want in your body 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.380
 for 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.660
 make muscles grow so they have 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.850
 in order to see if you want 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.370
 meet your goal quickly then 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.060
 they should adjust their priorities and look 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.070
 if it is necessary to use alcohol in the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.320
 moment they have to build the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.230
 muscle or if they have burn fat 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.390
 whatever these goals I do for the 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.330
 moment to you priority is a little 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.880
 that was all for a while and well let's go 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.410
 to see with aragÃ³n results if it goes very 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.139
 well I think it will continue to do so 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.229
 more time 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.969
 and all that everything is so the 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.880
 priority of each and to fulfill 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:04.490
 our goals so friends 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.130
 and if they are going to drink anyway 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.860
 alcohol if you feel obligated to 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.600
 do it for a social factor so what 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.740
 I would recommend them to take a bit of 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.360
 wine that is not so high in calories 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.060
 besides wine also owns shares 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.710
 antioxidants do not stay that long 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.530
 in the body like the other others 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.230
 types of alcohol or a bit of wikis 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.540
 they are not called but stay away from 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.530
 the blanks that are only full 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.750
 of sugar has a chemical and well this 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.710
 what you read would retard more all these 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.000
 processes but I invite you to visit
