00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.620
 Robert Gibbs who is in a room spin after discussion 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.080
 We have now shown you faced clone Debbie Schultz Aserman 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.960
 Uh ... about Net Killers case for the same people 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.780
 Erica ORGA some of us if you go to the counter 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.219
 Robert Gibbs about it now 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.710
 His answer at the beginning seemed okay 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.259
 It's really really bad at the end let's give the full context here 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.199
 There is great if 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.670
 Hello Mexican defender Bala demanded difficult because of neglect discuss foreign policy well 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.979
 Look forward to this President's share in the fight for frankness 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.290
 Uh ... social provider Kalisbel 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.670
 When they are people who are trying to harm us 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.100
 Um ... leads to 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 The printer has these precision beaches 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.740
 Take a fight against them do not follow due legal process 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.740
 We took their fight against them law Roddick lawfully retail order 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.030
 Getting Started Fighting 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.730
 Was it again or you are in the matter I'm just trying to try your answer 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.300
 Questions without them 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.220
 Live without u doing it but if you answer my question to you in the same i 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.540
 Well not actually here answers my question someone doing it tomorrow as that 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.600
 or not 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.670
 So that's where it's about 11 they put up that question 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.640
 you know that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.810
 His boycott largely imposes what you mean easy 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.890
 The second was that he wanted just a nice back down but that was fine we were gonna get 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.670
 An answer anyway 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 But the EK 90 gives him calculated that he was like the proportion of everyone to this just so 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.150
 The week out of this plot is not being looked and meant that it was going 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.480
 Far away I say I'm not taking serious questions other than while actually they are the most 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.240
 Serious Meretz correct question so please give the knowledge is that there was an attempt 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 This 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 The answer to this question is a very difficult question so let's continue this 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 He wants nothing else how you can defend killers again I think he said 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.830
 He thought he was happy to talk about 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.690
 Take the battle out 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.610
 Uh ... make sure that those who pledge to do damage 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.170
 For the people in this country and to offer shore resistance oh ... what we have to do 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 Uh ... to make sure that does not seem 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.030
 Almost similar to your bush solution 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.950
 We have to beat them there before they come here 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.280
 Now or more we can do everything in Yemen 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789
 We know that civilians are usually killed 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.319
 Every one of the civilians in those raids, we will show you the numbers on them 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.209
 In the past again and again 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.490
 Perhaps the saloon turns on the war it had a great do it from 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.229
 This is the killer that President Mama probably fixes 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.659
 People were often not on the list even that 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.589
 But even if you put civilians inside 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.659
 All Milton really offers on these lists are hundreds of Milton Surf 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.110
 Alisha Mills is to pretend that we put on a recall 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.969
 We have killed about 3000 ah so pull right directly to 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.469
 Everyone was coming to our shores 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.899
 It could be that or they were fighting us in Pakistan 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.809
 Because work in Pakistan 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.769
 The newest hit is Connie's hot network and you might say hey we should have become 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.690
 Network 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 Because they are going to fear our troops or they are helping people in our forces 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.389
 In Afghanistan 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.980
 Kony was also a stock network in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.729
 Account or pants 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.159
 They do not have the intention to hit our beaches when it's discovered 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.869
 Inwi dolls from Afghanistan 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.500
 So it is Bush's doctrine like I do not like it 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.989
 But so far no ugly ugly antidote 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.919
 But it is time 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.779
 Remember now here 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.599
 Uh ... on the world no ke and put on the list of Kia 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.980
 Knowledge management has in the press 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.209
 Unknown 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.579
 We did not kill Ann and 'We had pulled out the strike 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.929
 In a separate drone strike, we also killed a 16-year-old son 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.699
 That was not for killers 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.430
 The government did not tell us why we kill the mother was wrong or if they were 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.849
 She intends to kill them as they killed his young cousin as well as the children's work 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.449
 Did not go to go is to find 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.649
 It was now that his not even good according to our information 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.589
 But he says the sixteen-year-old trying to find can be done 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.679
 He does not know when he is looking for the right 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.399
 As we could only have been killed two weeks ago 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.399
 What happened 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.169
 He would say goodbye to his cousin and they would have dinner 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.439
 He was about to return to the US Home and concerns 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.949
 American citizen 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.799
 When a bomb was dropped it was unmanned 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.019
 They kill all of them 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.860
 Give his ass about it and listen to this 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.699
 Honestly 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.369
 Horrible things 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.839
 Do you think they killed them like the 16 year old he is 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.979
 A US citizen is justified 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:22.329
 The pride I came here is concerned in one row I know but in 1 way 

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.280
 Citizenship 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.089
 Prisoners which they consider to be a great harm to the people of this country 

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:32.530
 Uh ... the area commander was out 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.239
 Hoping to catch up 

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:36.179
 And destruction 

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:38.280
 We want people to share his religion 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.280
 Uh ... and others in this country at the end of an American citizen and that was not 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.620
 Untargeted targeted all about 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.199
 Try any under his eyes in the adjustments I would suggest you have now 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.060
 More responsible parents there 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.259
 Uh ... really concerned about the welfare of their children 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.429
 Uh ... I do not think that becoming an imminent al Qaeda terrorist is jihad is better 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:04:59.199
 Road 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.619
 To go around doing some excellent local use is a difficult question 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.090
 The reason is that it is difficult because they should not play in the first place 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.009
 More stock gives even trying to answer 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.710
 The thing that has no answer 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.659
 What does he say say something terrible 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.139
 Nor should he be outside the terrorist 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.429
 Is what we are doing now 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:19.959
 United States of America 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:25.749
 We kill the cause of the sixteen-year-old children we liked their dat 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:27.800
 The cold sends up the man's spine 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.069
 That is democratic governance 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.710
 These are the men who were supposed to be progressive 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.289
 His boss was the man who had these murders and constitutional law 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.539
 professor 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.139
 These are the men who are supposed to bring us a change 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.550
 Also I would like to change 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.749
 George W. Bush 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.080
 Never assassinate citizen u_s_ abroad 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.669
 Turns any operation due to eavesdropping without following legal procedures Yes it 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.559
 I ordered the explosions abroad 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:00.779
 But this is a different level u_s_ kill citizens without trial without 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.740
 Go to eliminate all without being bound by legal procedures 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.900
 Then 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.419
 Implement a sixteen-year-old when asked about it and tell you 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.719
 It should have been that tear 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.650
 Did not kill his father who was hit in 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.789
 Is to be killed two weeks ago 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.590
 This was a different strike they did not have to do 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.910
 This is cancer patients
