00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello everyone, 8 today we are 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.899
 continue to survey found adding 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 a lot of interesting 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.210
 facilities at the moment because I have 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.219
 there is a warehouse 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.139
 and in this warehouse inside is located 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.570
 just a huge number of boxes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.210
 if he is a spirits and in these chests there is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 just a varied amount 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.180
 different things, I think the fact that they no 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.859
 fuck yourself 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 I think that this is not a little bit . 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.430
 fair to the environment 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 the world as resources which we 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.929
 spent on building this warehouse 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.989
 practically nothing compared to 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.190
 the resources that we have here in general 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.500
 here already a little bit yes it is specifically this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.969
 a little cheating in general we go further 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 remember our winter house 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.500
 so here is a small hybrid of his then 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 I mean, this house is more or less 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.140
 as modified, I would say to him 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.770
 present protection protection in the form of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.270
 cacti on all sides of the horizon 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.800
 a little awkward in a bathhouse tons well 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.559
 Nichrome are not visible, see what 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.260
 looked out the window that cacti yes 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 again if you drink this glass here 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.030
 and knock out specifically intermediate 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 the distance between somehow yourself then 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.070
 principle was more or less on my 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 look well again by itself in 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.200
 principle, the house is not bad 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 If you include viewing this here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 defense 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.750
 little foreign protection there on 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 Zemtsev or any opponents of pests 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.909
 in general, we go further here we have 2 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.000
 modified winter house which is on 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.950
 actually surrounded by such a laby 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.259
 all here in principle here are two 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 house and they themselves original 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.060
 bearing in mind this security system 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.829
 You can say so at least 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 here's the word house and i liked it a bit 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.329
 more than a house with cacti again 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.149
 if you fall into this lava then fuck you 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.759
 there is little chance that you will 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.619
 choose alive if somehow son 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.140
 cactus still go around with a few times and 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.570
 we go further and then we 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 there is a water slide at the very 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.539
 it's really huge and I don’t even 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.310
 grabs a hillock to be honest 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.260
 show you this but oh well in principle 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.670
 let's set it as it is and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.739
 used generally as you can 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 notice this is really a water slide 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.970
 really having a very strange beginning 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 a very strange ending might make not 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.590
 big rig or something else or 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.250
 extension at least some, and here 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.349
 This is the most stupid thing that I found in 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.870
 I found this in general in this slide 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.550
 in view of vata, no shit flows at 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.920
 least it does not always happen sometimes she 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.819
 sometimes it flows and sometimes 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.750
 generally fuck you understand what she's doing 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.849
 is that to make this water flow 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.580
 down you have to destroy data here 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.890
 blocks and sometimes it happens that if you 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.530
 destroy these blocks then a damn 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.099
 it will happen even in this case 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.560
 will flow 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.620
 well at least it is in principle not so 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.810
 too bad if necessary okay it is very 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.480
 slowly and vilely on horseradish this at all 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.659
 made can be made as decorative 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.930
 facilities I think it will be suitable for 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.659
 this house he fucking volume in this 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.849
 slides like de basket i think would come off 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.230
 more or less then if still put 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.370
 maybe some blog here 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.140
 let's say here and turn it on too 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.360
 would there be anything to do here these 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.629
 the blocks shatter and the water flowed you from there 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.150
 and down overall i think what the fuck 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.030
 need that stumble with words in general 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.730
 I think you understand the essence of this 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.810
 facilities would still use both 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.569
 decorative in general, we go further 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.459
 we are located in principle is not so 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.230
 the original structure is ordinary 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.569
 a bunker in which there are several 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.450
 chests that keep themselves bow and 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.420
 arrows again defend from everyones 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.090
 enemies from all monsters go further 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.860
 and here we have an arena I don't 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.879
 I understand the hell do not add words 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.569
 magical to each of these buildings but 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.609
 Basically, I am, it's just not us 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.609
 it's just stupid in my opinion in general 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.249
 this arena is covered with sand 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.109
 absolute sand and this bunker is not 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.120
 watch this slide well, just me 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.549
 it happened by accident, and in that 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.900
 this arena has just four walls 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.310
 which consist of cobblestones and sand and 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.229
 that the most important thing is, in principle, not 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.550
 so bad in fact I will clothe 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.620
 you can test your strength against 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.380
 any monsters or anything else 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.180
 but come on like this we go on here at 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.030
 us a little modified arena on 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.610
 fact that makes the conditions of the struggle 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.910
 and a little harder why because 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.370
 the sides are generally surrounded by lava here 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.949
 Here is a two-meter lava again the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.229
 another you don't look at this one either 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.630
 Here I am too close to garbage 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.419
 In fact, arenas are not so much the principle. 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.699
 so you can 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.699
 do something like this 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.560
 construction so we go on further on 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.419
 we are located agriculture on and fields 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.910
 here we have pumpkin 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.180
 the field is pretty big in my opinion 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.280
 and already filled with water so you don’t 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.740
 have to waste your precious time 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.570
 next we have a reed field for me 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.889
 she seems a little memory they are the same 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.830
 big and 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.509
 watermelon field is our latest in 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.220
 Basically, this and all that I wanted you 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.800
 show and demonstrate dear 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.990
 friends here such here we have a wonderful 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.460
 buildings are present in the second part 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.800
 This mod in 3 in 3 will be something 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.099
 more or less unusual believe me 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.620
 so I advise you to look in general 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.710
 today we considered how much we 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.380
 Today reviewed 910 buildings and all 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.479
 they are pretty peculiar interesting 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.789
 can use your discretion in 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:59.969
 overall if you liked us very much 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.969
 have you been to see you in the new series yet
