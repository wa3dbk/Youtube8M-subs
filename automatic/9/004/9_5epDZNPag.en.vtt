hi<00:00:06.850> I'm<00:00:07.120> Steve<00:00:07.420> honor<00:00:07.630> with<00:00:07.810> Patterson

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
hi I'm Steve honor with Patterson

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.509 
hi I'm Steve honor with Patterson
a<00:00:08.710> technology<00:00:09.430> guy<00:00:09.580> and<00:00:09.910> I<00:00:09.940> probably<00:00:10.210> manage

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
a technology guy and I probably manage

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.089 
a technology guy and I probably manage
designed<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> new<00:00:11.969> very<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:12.629> and<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:13.949> do<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
designed the new very can and do we do a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.820 
designed the new very can and do we do a
35-millimeter<00:00:14.699> do<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> two-thirds<00:00:16.080> both

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
35-millimeter do we do a two-thirds both

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.050 
35-millimeter do we do a two-thirds both
the<00:00:16.980> valid<00:00:17.250> markets<00:00:17.609> both<00:00:17.759> are<00:00:17.910> quite

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the valid markets both are quite

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
the valid markets both are quite
important<00:00:18.509> so<00:00:19.169> what<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:19.410> did<00:00:19.800> we

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
important so what we basically did we

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859 
important so what we basically did we
made<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> Cameron<00:00:20.610> modular<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.239> we<00:00:21.570> answered

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
made the Cameron modular and we answered

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.269 
made the Cameron modular and we answered
basically<00:00:22.230> both<00:00:22.410> formats<00:00:22.829> and<00:00:23.130> both

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
basically both formats and both

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.630 
basically both formats and both
applications<00:00:23.599> so<00:00:24.599> the<00:00:24.720> camera<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.800> modular

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
applications so the camera is a modular

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.929 
applications so the camera is a modular
assembly<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.599> common<00:00:28.110> recorder<00:00:28.590> into

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
assembly or the common recorder into

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.909 
assembly or the common recorder into
camera<00:00:29.939> heads<00:00:30.180> we<00:00:30.809> have<00:00:30.899> a<00:00:30.960> 35-millimeter<00:00:31.439> PL

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
camera heads we have a 35-millimeter PL

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.459 
camera heads we have a 35-millimeter PL
4k<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> two-thirds<00:00:33.809> inch<00:00:34.079> 1080p

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
4k and we have a two-thirds inch 1080p

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.400 
4k and we have a two-thirds inch 1080p
be<00:00:35.129> for<00:00:35.399> mount<00:00:35.700> high-speed<00:00:36.450> camera<00:00:36.930> they're

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
be for mount high-speed camera they're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.750 
be for mount high-speed camera they're
both<00:00:37.530> high<00:00:37.710> quality<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> both<00:00:38.399> production

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
both high quality the both production

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
both high quality the both production
cameras<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:39.930> aimed<00:00:40.170> towards

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
cameras but it's really aimed towards

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.250 
cameras but it's really aimed towards
fulfilling<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.370> sports<00:00:42.360> documentary

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
fulfilling that sports documentary

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
fulfilling that sports documentary
narrative<00:00:43.890> history<00:00:44.130> type<00:00:44.550> application<00:00:45.150> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
narrative history type application and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.479 
narrative history type application and
then<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> PL<00:00:46.680> mount<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.160> obviously<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
then the PL mount is obviously the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.270 
then the PL mount is obviously the
narrative<00:00:47.910> storytelling<00:00:49.010> when<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> need

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
narrative storytelling when you need

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
narrative storytelling when you need
that<00:00:50.310> show<00:00:50.790> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> field<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.570> selective

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that show at the field and selective

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.530 
that show at the field and selective
focus<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.920> gives<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> HD<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.060> can<00:00:54.210> shoot<00:00:54.329> took

a week a new HD we can shoot 4k DCI we

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.270 
a week a new HD we can shoot 4k DCI we
can<00:00:58.050> shoot<00:00:58.200> up<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.380> full<00:00:58.649> four<00:00:58.950> months<00:00:59.130> at<00:00:59.220> the

can shoot up to full four months at the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
can shoot up to full four months at the
same<00:00:59.460> time<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.660> Cairo<00:01:01.020> we

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
same time you want to do for Cairo we

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.020 
same time you want to do for Cairo we
can<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.309> 4k<00:01:02.520> mezzanine

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
can do that i'm going to do 4k mezzanine

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.870 
can do that i'm going to do 4k mezzanine
we<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:04.290> i<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.439> 2k<00:01:04.759> makes<00:01:05.759> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we can do that when i do 2k makes it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
we can do that when i do 2k makes it
mean<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.149> can<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.200> proxy<00:01:07.590> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
mean we can do that but if your proxy we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
mean we can do that but if your proxy we
can<00:01:07.829> do<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.759> we<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.149> all<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
can do that but we can do it all the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
can do that but we can do it all the
same<00:01:09.840> time<00:01:10.079> so<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> workflow<00:01:11.219> enhancement

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
same time so it's a workflow enhancement

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.179 
same time so it's a workflow enhancement
in<00:01:12.030> terms<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.630> look<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.469> my<00:01:13.530> proxy<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.070> my
