00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.810
 small answer x small and large 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.790
 we confirm everything in the afternoon we write further 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.540
 starlings now need height stats 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.290

 at this bar on the main price statistics 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.700
 let's take a screen for example while nato 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.280
 list grandfather confirm click on there 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.200
 as you see me now zero kills i 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.200
 surprised to change it 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:37.459
 I figure one number two so it will be with 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.189
 Every now I will tell you how 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.269
 display the school command how to display the 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.019
 statistics 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.790
 the main screen is writing the same on 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.989
 display now writes site 2 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.060
 approve coverage highlighted on the right but 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.459
 it happens that some people don't 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 is highlighted why because in them 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.940
 if they have a total killing or horns 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.819
 less than 1 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.010
 then they have something to drink or now I 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.810
 by the way about me as me numbers i 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.260
 I will also tell you spare parts 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.670
 now the player parameter is take it 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.790
 parameter allows you to change numbers 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.299
 statistics 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.170
 Here writes Lars 25 network settings 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.909
 Set this device setlist SET adds 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.189
 some definite figure is 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.569
 adds, too, only he adds all 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:30.069
 time that is and said I will write let's say 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.940
 10 types tolerance 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.740
 set 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.300
 ten 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.420
 and again I will write here it will not be all 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.480
 time 1020 you 20 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.819
 this is the principle of the command set command 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.860
 it also adds a mass dowel diode 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.410
 effect only it adds and type 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.569
 Tolerance for example, too, 20 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.120
 answer person how to assign a value 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.530
 now let's just sort it out 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.909
 she deletes the command, that is, if on 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.959
 noise and write what number I want 10 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.299
 there bite 30 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.069
 I retire more in terms of 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.849
 hot-dog for the answer and 30 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:20.850
 here I will be 10 points time something is necessary 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:24.479
 change here we go further scoreboard 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.400
 splyce so it grows 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.960
 removes that is if you have some 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.570
 something else is left that we can you 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.180
 stupidly remove everything i tense let's 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.440
 come here 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.570
 I confirm even more to write inuzuka 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.930
 hopes I immediately disappeared from the list 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.880
 because my number is less than one 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.220
 as soon as i get one kill 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.070
 for example, I immediately Mrs. highlighted 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.710
 list one more but one nuance 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.690
 It turns out when I wrote as the name 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.669
 statistics will be this sexy then how 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.610
 see me the name has not changed it 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.919
 due to the fact that you need to update the server 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.560
 or reload on a series of soul necessarily 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.560
 series board examples madly series 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.560
 multiplayer 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.110
 and as you can see the name has changed already 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.440
 It has become all the same statistics 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:24.210
 preserved since delete statistics 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:28.680
 scoreboard firing tevis and commander him 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.800
