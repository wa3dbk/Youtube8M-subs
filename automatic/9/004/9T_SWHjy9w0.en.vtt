00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.390
 Good day to you guys we 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.859
 We are now on our 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.920
 post apocalyptic server and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.639
 We are standing right in front of this new kind of loot 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.679
 first aid kit 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.599
 like any other swag you can raise it 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 and take in your inventory 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.550
 all this is necessary for the fact that finally 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.250
 as we said in the plot appeared 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.109
 viruses you can watch them on your 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.269
 sensors where we have a clock with the left 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 hand temperature is 13 degrees now 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.040
 day and warm and from another country viruses 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 all we have is a minus and to zero 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 denoted by green i.e. it is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.120
 favorable conditions for us and we can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 with them survive all that is above zero 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.640
 eat from 1 to 2 will be highlighted 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.550
 yellow and your rate 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.710
 heart that you see our lists 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.699
 needs will slowly drop 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.160
 from 3 and above it is red indicators in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.250
 here's your heart rate 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.900
 will fall constant very quickly and 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.030
 you most likely do not have time for anything 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.689
 run up are if you don't have yourself 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.210
 first aid kit you can't knock it all down 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.860
 we stand right in front of the hospital therefore 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 we found a first-aid kit near her and it's like 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.799
 just a hint that you can patch here 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.490
 new items of this most interesting 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.040
 lot 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.610
 the hospital is completely worked out from there 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.460
 Lesha you see that each room has 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 its some kind of themed interior 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.079
 some scenes you will see scattered 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.619
 some kind of bed and everything like that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.649
 devastation 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.259
 but, no less, rooms 1 resemble each other 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.119
 the other is that here you are the same 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.990
 everything is glued somehow everything is done with us 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.090
 the hospital is the same 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.189
 getting lost is very easy and if you're in 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.280
 first time got into this interior rather 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.920
 just you too get lost in it here 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.740

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.869

 respirator when we are in the bunker 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.470
 automatically he is removed there the most 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.470
 such is considered clean air and can 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.350
 breathe easy on the street he will have you 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.459
 dress and you will walk with him to 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.860
 no viruses were terrible for you 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.280
 maintaining a balance on the server in order 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.959
 for newcomers to just swing 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.970
 Now conditions as you understand have become 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.950
