00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
if you can close one eye and pull it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.070 
if you can close one eye and pull it
inside<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.220> close<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.030> pull<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.780> you'll

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
inside so close it and pull it up you'll

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.869 
inside so close it and pull it up you'll
get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> straight<00:02:10.530> line<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> can

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
get a straight line and then you can

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.899 
get a straight line and then you can
just<00:02:12.000> literally<00:02:12.420> draw<00:02:12.840> across<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.909> now

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909

drawn<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.460> like<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.850> now<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.980> find<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.070> very

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
drawn up like that now I find it very

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.640 
drawn up like that now I find it very
hard<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.460> do<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.610> my<00:02:26.820> own<00:02:26.850> eyes<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.500> because<00:02:28.500> my

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
hard to do on my own eyes and because my

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.740 
hard to do on my own eyes and because my
eyes<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.130> down<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.520> tend<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.150> draw<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
eyes do go down so I tend to draw the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.240 
eyes do go down so I tend to draw the
line<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.260> finish<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> line<00:02:31.800> off<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
line and then finish the line off at the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.680 
line and then finish the line off at the
end<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.640> another<00:02:33.540> trick<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:35.420> swear<00:02:36.420> by<00:02:36.480> it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
end and another trick but I swear by it

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.450

line<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:02.970> completely<00:04:03.390> up<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:04.220> but<00:04:05.220> these

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
line is completely up to you but these

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.220 
line is completely up to you but these
subtypes<00:04:05.730> are<00:04:05.850> very<00:04:06.180> good<00:04:06.420> for<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.720> sweeping

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
subtypes are very good for a sweeping

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.320 
subtypes are very good for a sweeping
aspect<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.770> no<00:04:08.040> don't<00:04:08.310> don't<00:04:08.670> jam<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.180> there

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
aspect so no don't don't jam it in there

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.130 
aspect so no don't don't jam it in there
don't<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.370> don't<00:04:11.370> over<00:04:11.760> exert<00:04:12.090> pressure<00:04:12.300> is

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
don't and don't over exert pressure is

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.280 
don't and don't over exert pressure is
only<00:04:13.290> gonna<00:04:13.440> end<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.710> tears<00:04:13.920> literally<00:04:14.700> just

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
only gonna end in tears literally just

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:25.250 
only gonna end in tears literally just
pull<00:04:16.290> across<00:04:22.760> from<00:04:23.760> drag<00:04:24.000> over<00:04:24.330> now<00:04:24.750> there<00:04:25.200> you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
pull across from drag over now there you

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.340 
pull across from drag over now there you
go<00:04:25.670> see<00:04:26.670> that<00:04:26.700> now<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.150> see<00:04:27.360> how<00:04:27.630> i<00:04:27.660> stop<00:04:28.140> there

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
go see that now you see how i stop there

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.480 
go see that now you see how i stop there
now<00:04:28.530> if<00:04:28.620> you've<00:04:28.740> got<00:04:28.890> an<00:04:28.980> arm<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.340> dine<00:04:29.460> you

now if you've got an arm and dine you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.520 
now if you've got an arm and dine you
can<00:04:29.730> actually<00:04:30.030> continue<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.660> line<00:04:30.840> take

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
can actually continue that line take

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.480 
can actually continue that line take
that<00:04:31.650> cross

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
that cross

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.820 
that cross
that<00:04:32.699> line<00:04:32.880> up<00:04:33.150> there<00:04:33.599> and<00:04:34.470> you'll<00:04:34.620> get<00:04:34.770> a

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
that line up there and you'll get a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.339 
that line up there and you'll get a
perfect<00:04:35.099> flip<00:04:35.400> now<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:36.030> don't<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:37.169> that

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
perfect flip now I don't have that

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.529 
perfect flip now I don't have that
luxury<00:04:37.470> I'm<00:04:37.830> afraid<00:04:38.099> my<00:04:38.340> eyes<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:39.180> go<00:04:39.330> down<00:04:39.509> a

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
luxury I'm afraid my eyes you go down a

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.379 
luxury I'm afraid my eyes you go down a
little<00:04:39.690> bit<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.669> what<00:04:41.819> I<00:04:41.849> tend<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.210> do<00:04:42.360> is

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
little bit so what I tend to do is

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.230 
little bit so what I tend to do is
actually<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:43.740> know<00:04:43.860> keep<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.550> simple<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.030> don't

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
actually you know keep it simple I don't

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.180 
actually you know keep it simple I don't
take<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.449> too<00:04:45.750> far<00:04:45.780> out<00:04:46.229> my<00:04:46.560> eyes<00:04:46.680> don't<00:04:46.889> suit

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
take it too far out my eyes don't suit

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.460 
take it too far out my eyes don't suit
it<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.389> what<00:04:48.479> I<00:04:48.539> do<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.960> actually<00:04:49.080> close

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
it and so what I do is I actually close

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.040 
it and so what I do is I actually close
my<00:04:49.650> eyes<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.979> literally<00:04:50.460> turn<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.509> up<00:04:51.780> and

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
my eyes and literally turn that up and

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.490 
my eyes and literally turn that up and
literally<00:04:52.830> just<00:04:53.400> go<00:04:53.729> wrong<00:04:54.169> so<00:04:55.169> just<00:04:55.199> draw

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
literally just go wrong so just draw

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.200 
literally just go wrong so just draw
that<00:04:55.650> line<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.979> there<00:04:56.099> almost<00:04:56.400> follow<00:04:57.000> the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
that line in there almost follow the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.210 
that line in there almost follow the
line<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.449> your<00:04:57.690> eyelash<00:04:58.110> if<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.830> imagine<00:04:58.979> your

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
line of your eyelash if you imagine your

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.550 
line of your eyelash if you imagine your
eyelash<00:04:59.580> flicks<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:00.449> there<00:05:00.630> follow<00:05:01.319> that<00:05:01.500> up

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.899 
what happened the Sun it's for lighting
quite<00:05:57.060> well<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.949> watching<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:59.070> with<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.699> line

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
quite well and watching it with the line

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.570 
quite well and watching it with the line
itself<00:06:00.210> as<00:06:00.719> well<00:06:00.870> really<00:06:01.830> makes<00:06:02.009> it<00:06:02.159> pop<00:06:02.280> now

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580

if<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.569> was<00:06:03.690> going<00:06:03.810> if<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.199> was<00:06:04.289> going<00:06:04.469> out<00:06:04.710> I

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
if I was going if I was going out I

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.700 
if I was going if I was going out I
probably<00:06:05.669> potentially<00:06:06.659> make<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:06.870> slightly

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
probably potentially make it slightly

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.670 
probably potentially make it slightly
more<00:06:08.190> arch<00:06:08.610> there<00:06:09.270> maybe<00:06:09.990> put<00:06:10.259> a<00:06:10.289> bit<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:10.530> a

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
more arch there maybe put a bit of a

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.089 
more arch there maybe put a bit of a
smoky<00:06:10.889> eye<00:06:11.099> in<00:06:11.250> there<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:12.090> bourgeois<00:06:12.509> and
