00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.810
 Welcome to the seventh edition 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.059
 of the baw shipyards today we employ 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.509
 us with the Japanese 48 premium 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.490
 cruiser of the kita kami this is it 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.580
 looking around for a light cruiser 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.570
 the kuma class is based 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 originally the kita had camille 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.910
 their stacking was already 1919 around 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 More than 20 years in use before she 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 and another sister ship in 1941 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 finally to the playable here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.669
 torpedo cruiser were converted in 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.829
 for that the medium was gone 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.040
 widened and they got a total of 10 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.719
 4 left torpedo throwers donated it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 is the kita camille at least what the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.989
 torpedo armament concerns that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 the most powerful ship in the world 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 to play holidays is in reality 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 could the kita kami this advantage 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.059
 unfortunately never play 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.410
 both in the battle for pearl harbor 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.149
 as well as in the battle of midway 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.489
 it was merely to protect the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.230
 rear battleships used so 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.000
 It took just under a year before marriage 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.020
 the torpedo throwers back to six 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.850
 were reduced 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 the remaining positions were from 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.000
 Dropships no taken and the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.400
 Kita came too fast 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.260
 transport ship converted because after the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 landing of US troops on Guadalcanal 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.890
 This type of ship was in the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 Japanese fleet urgently needed 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 shortly after the end of the second 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.250
 it was already in 1945 by 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.340
 The Japanese fleet is listed and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.470
 in the following year queried in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 The kita camille has the game in addition to the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 excellent torpedo armament still 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.579
 four protected towers 140 mm 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.079
 These cause relatively little 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.030
 hurt and own a short one 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.009
 reach the same but with the whole 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.259
 a very high rate of fire and good 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.070
 precision again turn out the turn 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.600
 towers for a cruiser pretty fast 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 there is also a second artillery 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 and an air defense with five 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.770
 kilometers and for one 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.970
 cruiser average firepower 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.730
 but now let's have a look 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.650
 in motion at acceleration and 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.180
 turning radius are maximum average 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.010
 at the helm change time and the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.510
 However, the final speed surpasses 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.930
 the kita k like most others 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.700
 cruiser my whole piece are 36 knots 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.410
 a decent announcement and also the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.709
 Tann is well worth a cruiser 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.709
 Well 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.940
 the most powerful weapon of the daycare 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 camille the torpedoes want of course 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 also be used properly with 20 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.600
 torpedoes on each side and one 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.190
 You can reach a range of ten kilometers 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.570
 the opponent a true fan 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.570
 torpedoes against fortunes 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.510
 speed as well as after loading time 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.460
 torpedoes are unfortunately only average 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 but the kita also got it 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.230
 a few more tidy protectors 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.970
 These have a high rate of fire and 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.740
 are quite precise and are suitable 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.480
 good to continue to puncture the opponent 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.650
 while focusing on it 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.970
 trying to dodge your torpedoes 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.370
 thereby your range advantages 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.260
 play as well as the daycare 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.700
 Camille has a weak armor 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.890
 and little highlights 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.870
 You have this on a frequent basis 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.850
 Module hits to fight other 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.260
 but also send you shared salmen 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.330
 fast on the seabed yours 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.070
 The main strategy is therefore the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.110
 Opponents from a distance 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.850
 to chase torpedoes at him and him 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.020
 then continue with their protected 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.430
 to pressurize and sink 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.260
 tries as centrally as possible on the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.360
 Battlefield to stay around your thoroughly 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.190
 good air defense does not run into empty space 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.330
 allow 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.800
 if we take a long sip now 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.660
 have drunk destination water 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:37.160
 enemy destroyers and kreutzer not 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:38.900
 more than cannon fodder for you thanks 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.220
 arm your state torpedo 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.630
 it could even be with opponents 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.520
 battle ships need to record here 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.170
 but the first side of the torpedoes sit 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.730
 otherwise yourselves will split you up 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.989
 Secondary artillery enemy 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.989
 battleships pretty fast 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.100
 Generally you should prefer the melee 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.140
 go out of the way because he so the advantage 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.299
 a precise guns hardly play 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.950
 could also not be breathy 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.600
 a chance that the kita came to her one 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.600
 enemy torpedo attack survive 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.030
 could then again a short 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.980
 summary for you the kita 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.479
 Camille is a light torpedo cruiser 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.389
 and clearly has hers here too 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.460
 Advantages are 20 torpedoes on each 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.960
 side with ten kilometers of range are 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.030
 a clear announcement 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.580
 the guns are waiting with high 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.169
 firing rate and precision on top of that 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.229
 she pretty fast and for a cruiser 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.910
 agile the disadvantages are definitely in 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.130
 Score the few structure and the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.979
 weak armor also in the very 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.570
 low alpha hurt the gunman 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.370
 who these pros and cons properly 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.430
 can play the expected here 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.240
 Ship with a very high fun factor that 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.830
 came to kita 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.539
 I hope you had fun watching 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.180
 and listen and see you in the 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.140
 next issue of basquiat then with 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.660
 the legendary Japanese 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.740
 battleship of yamato in this 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.740
 See you soon
