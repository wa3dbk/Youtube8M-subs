00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.610
 hello today we're going to see a few 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.000
 Pocket watches 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.500
 that we have in our production not the 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.360
 we have posts on the website but 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.360
 eventually we will include them 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.590
 right now they are still for sale 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.370
 but good little by little 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.810
 It is much work and little time 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.000
 we are doing what we can 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.350
 little by little, well, here we see in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.989
 the video we can see some 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.230
 models these are in this box we have 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.860
 all are strings the typical clock 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.489
 classic grandfather pocket for 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.489
 giv'em rope 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.550
 there are different brands for example this 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.739
 sun have 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.620
 we see that it was plated in gold for its 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.000
 I work both on the inner side as 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.360
 outside is a label but good we 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.270
 we get an idea of ​​what the job is like 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.020
 of the whole box in front of you from behind 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.460
 machinery is a machine and in all 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.890
 they the concellos carry the same 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 French machine of very good quality 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.990
 with all kinds of spare parts and with 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.770
 repair possibilities if there is any 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.770
 apparent problem 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.310
 I have seen this model 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.000
 second model is therefore practically what 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.439
 same other exterior design is a little bit 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 larger 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.670
 a little more of this or blandito 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 Any case by email or 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.740
 well on the phone call me and oslo and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.110
 all features and designs 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.050
 those who are 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.130
 this comes with roman numbers 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.469
 It is the same machinery 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 and well, here we see it has a shield 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.430
 to be able to record this blue is a 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.410
 protector is simply blue 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.200
 and behind it has another area too 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:11.379
 to be able to record 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.379
 a moment is also of the brand alltel 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.489
 and May 1 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.830
 and the subject of the cover is controversial 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.410
 there are those who prefer to count for fifth 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.500
 pact since we are here I am going to explain 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.410
 a small detail that makes it not 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.200
 things are not what it seems 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.370
 in general, people always think that 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.560
 is the most protected machinery when 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.930
 in general around here 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.080
 in the area where it exits the dock cas 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.030
 closing 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.130
 having a slot exported from 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.810
 the entire goal although we have the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.910
 watch in your pocket is always going to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.220
 bring tar and dust or dirt things 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.170
 have one that does not have a cap, do not pass and 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.660
 we happen to have the same here I do not know if 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.220
 it will be seen that surely not but good 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.420
 looking for him in the laps has a 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.860
 hole that also that's where 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.440
 The spring comes out and keeps the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.790
 lid and it is also a little hole 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.790
 opening where can 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.189
 so good the fact that it covers it 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:17.969
 If it 's beautiful, it protects the best 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.909
 blows or scratches but makes the 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.590
 machine gets dirty more that is useless is 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.210
 say that in the long run a watch lasts 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.640
 without motor caps 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.990
 this one is completely smooth from behind in 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.910
 formed finished ice cream finished mirror 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.730
 with all the numbers this is a model 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.620
 brand alcohol all the numbers the same 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.620
 machinery 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.620
 french 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.870
 another hawk is the finish is different 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.700
 with stripes also with a small square 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.420
 where they can record some also 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.099
 mirror finish in several of the areas 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 with all the numbers in some numbers 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:01.200
 different and the needles also in place 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.200
 of this same machinery 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.890
 this is another alcohol with a finish 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.489
 different from behind triangle to 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.489
 I can record 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.520
 also with all the numbers and then 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.730
 similar to the first but changes in this 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.910
 has some antics in red 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.280
 and this is not black and back by 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.780
 that does not shine is smooth and the other 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.510
 he has died 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.750
 another model more also with this machine 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.160
 It's a little bit I do not care anymore, I say that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.660
 the machine is the same also in 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.630
 mirror finish carries a plastic 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.930
 protector really shines as much as the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.930
 other 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.990
 this is the design of the rothkopf 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.970
 old with the glass a little more 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.120
 small with the edge cited the bevel in 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.660
 gold and the rest in chrome but the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.260
 machinery is also the same as 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.620
 we have 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.750
 in either of us we continue by 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.180
 here this is a different brand term 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.630
 also same machine 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.320
 is gold plated and gilt good the 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.320
 back side comes 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.660
 it does like a good dotting that makes 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.160
 be very discreet and not scratch as much as 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.160
 it could be the mirror finish 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.410
 numeritos golden red the minutes 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.130
 finished 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.400
 plus the cut 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.259
 this floor remembers the same machine 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.370
 you seconds the six as they have 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.669
 everyone 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:59.970
 in gold plated this one that ends 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.970
 of a mirror everything has a protector 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.450
 also with very clear numbers the 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.450
 short type needles that are all 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.400
 and the last of this box 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.400
 is this 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:23.300
 so the finish is the same for 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.030
 example in these two partners you fix is 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.460
 exactly the same changes the brand the 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.740
 term or even have the symbol 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.250
 of the m is the same because it is the same 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.419
 horizon 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.720
 normally all these manufacturers that 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.660
 they do not have 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.330
 own brand do not have own machines 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.650
 What you do is buy machines at a 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.700
 specialized machine manufacturer 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.620
 then they all carry the same 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.240
 machinery and every then every 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.890
 dealer puts a brand that gives 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.210
 the win for example sergio is a 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.580
 land distributor what is 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.500
 thermidor that is another are not manufacturers 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.289
 but they distribute watches that buy 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.300
 to other manufacturers 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.210
 and good for this box is seen 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.879
 so he will prepare some more video for 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.189
 that you see more pocket watches than 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:07.659
 we have but all these are the 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.520
 same different characteristics 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:12.279
 models and I think it's pretty 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.089
 Of course many times to see the video 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.089
 and even the person
