want<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> cut<00:01:57.329> them

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
want to that do if you want to cut them

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
want to that do if you want to cut them
you'll<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> resolder<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.619> power

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you'll have to resolder on power

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.090 
you'll have to resolder on power
connectors<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.890> there

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
connectors as you can see here not there

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740 
connectors as you can see here not there
somewhere<00:02:02.579> else<00:02:02.700> you'll<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> figure<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
somewhere else you'll have to figure it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.120 
somewhere else you'll have to figure it
out<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.020> own<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.380> I'm<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:04.799> doing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
out on your own because I'm not doing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
out on your own because I'm not doing
that<00:02:05.280> guide<00:02:05.520> let's<00:02:06.509> plug<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.140> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that guide let's plug one of these in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.490 
that guide let's plug one of these in
and<00:02:07.469> let's<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.680> how<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.829> goes<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:09.500> I'm

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and let's see how it goes here so I'm

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
and let's see how it goes here so I'm
going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.770> leave<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.220> switch<00:02:11.489> powered<00:02:11.910> off<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
going to leave the switch powered off so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
going to leave the switch powered off so
there's<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.750> convenient

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
there's the convenient

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.580 
there's the convenient
on/off<00:02:13.980> switch<00:02:14.569> just<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.170> have<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
on/off switch just so that we have the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.119 
on/off switch just so that we have the
drama<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.760> turning<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.689> all<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.049> once<00:02:19.260> so

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
drama of turning it on all at once so

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.100 
drama of turning it on all at once so
you<00:02:20.189> can<00:02:20.400> plug<00:02:20.579> it<00:02:20.670> into<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.939> USB<00:02:21.269> port<00:02:21.659> on<00:02:21.720> your

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you can plug it into a USB port on your

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.119 
you can plug it into a USB port on your
motherboard<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.709> actually<00:02:22.829> this

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
motherboard you know what actually this

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.800 
motherboard you know what actually this
is<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> terrible<00:02:23.790> example<00:02:23.909> let<00:02:24.360> me<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.659> think

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
is a terrible example let me just think

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.259 
is a terrible example let me just think
if<00:02:25.019> there's<00:02:25.200> somewhere<00:02:25.500> else<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.269> you

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
if there's somewhere else that I can you

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.449 
if there's somewhere else that I can you
know<00:02:27.329> what<00:02:27.510> give<00:02:27.629> me<00:02:27.659> a<00:02:27.750> sec<00:02:27.930> your<00:02:28.110> guess<00:02:28.459> so

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
know what give me a sec your guess so

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.800 
know what give me a sec your guess so
let's<00:02:29.670> start<00:02:29.879> with<00:02:30.000> keyboard<00:02:30.480> lighting

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
let's start with keyboard lighting

USB port on a keyboard or other
peripheral<00:02:47.819> actually<00:02:48.569> here<00:02:48.780> let's<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:49.319> ahead

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
peripheral actually here let's go ahead

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.539 
peripheral actually here let's go ahead
and<00:02:49.889> try<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.629> monitor<00:02:52.109> oh<00:02:55.370> hold<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
and try it on a monitor oh hold on it

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:04.380 
and try it on a monitor oh hold on it
probably<00:02:56.639> has<00:02:56.879> to<00:02:56.909> be<00:02:57.090> powered<00:02:57.329> on

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.930 

yeah<00:03:05.140> yeah<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.070> here<00:03:06.220> check<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.520> subjective

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
yeah yeah so here check the subjective

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.940 
yeah yeah so here check the subjective

looks like that looks really good okay
now<00:03:21.220> let's<00:03:21.820> go<00:03:22.000> ahead<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.540> remember<00:03:22.900> that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
now let's go ahead and remember that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.450 
now let's go ahead and remember that
we'll<00:03:23.140> only<00:03:23.260> power<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.770> when<00:03:23.950> your<00:03:24.070> monitor<00:03:24.400> is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
we'll only power on when your monitor is

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.100 
we'll only power on when your monitor is
actually<00:03:24.850> receiving<00:03:25.180> an<00:03:25.390> input<00:03:25.660> signal<00:03:25.810> which

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
actually receiving an input signal which

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.200 
actually receiving an input signal which
is<00:03:26.230> pretty<00:03:26.440> neat<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.010> even<00:03:27.460> use<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
is pretty neat you can even use it to

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.270 
is pretty neat you can even use it to
pick<00:03:28.720> your<00:03:28.990> test<00:03:29.260> bench<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.770> can<00:03:29.950> plug<00:03:30.130> it

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
pick your test bench so you can plug it

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.699 
pick your test bench so you can plug it
anywhere<00:03:30.790> where<00:03:30.970> there's<00:03:31.150> USB<00:03:31.630> power<00:03:31.840> which

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
anywhere where there's USB power which

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.380 
anywhere where there's USB power which
just<00:03:32.860> makes<00:03:33.130> things<00:03:33.400> very<00:03:33.520> flexible<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.360> you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
just makes things very flexible so you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
just makes things very flexible so you
could<00:03:34.630> throw<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.990> onto<00:03:35.650> one<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:35.890> your<00:03:36.010> USB<00:03:36.340> s

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
could throw it onto one of your USB s

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.540 
could throw it onto one of your USB s
here<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.450> then<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.050> could<00:03:38.290> stick<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
here and then you could stick it to the
